		<shortDescription>An absolutely chilling, deeply unsettling horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Vanishing is a movie only those with ice in their veins can ever forget. The direction is absolutely brilliant, from the opening frames until the very end. I felt Saskia's fright when she thought she lost Rex initially, and her description of her dream made me feel chills. When she disappeared, Rex's combination of rage, frustration, anxiety, and grief was torture to watch. A particularly powerful moment was when he slammed the car door shut so hard the window crumbled into pieces.Watching Rex become consumed in every way by his quest to find Saskia was also extremely difficult to watch, although it was certainly inevitable. I found the professor's description of his actions appalling in many cases, the most notable one being when he fixates on Saskia and we see his POV. Seeing Saskia warmly respond to him was devastating, knowing what would happen. Throughout the film there was an overwhelming sense of doom and isolation, like this was a cruel world where even in the most idyllic settings evil lurked everywhere and attempting to fight it was futile. Rex undergoes one of the most harrowing emotional ordeals of any movie character ever, and when he is at the end of his rope his crucial decision would seem so insane out of context but viewers understand that it really is his only choice. The shock ending, especially the way it was done, almost made me scream, and I will never forget the final shot. The Vanishing could be shown in any film class on direction, as an example of perfection. Material that could have been turned into just a mediocre thriller with would have seemed like a lame twist was turned by George Sluizer into an utterly harrowing filmgoing experience. And that is the right word, because a movie like The Vanishing is not just watched-it is experienced.I estimate I have seen around 700 movies in my life, and horror is my favorite genre. I have only seen two films that left me so scared that after they ended I couldn't even move. One was Psycho, which I saw 10 years ago when I was only 12. The other one was just this year-The Vanishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several recommendations of Spoorloos (a.k.a. The Vanishing), I went ahead and bought the Criterion DVD release, which, by the way, has no extras. Let me say, I was not disappointed with the movie. If you like well-made, well-directed thrillers, it is definitely worth checking out. The story was simple enough; Rex's girlfriend mysteriously disappears at a gas station they stopped at while on vacation. Cut ahead three years and you still have him searching for her. Due to his persistence, the man responsible finally decides to get involved.With very little violence and no gore, Spoorloos was able to leave the viewer in a truly depressing state. Some people might call it boring but I found the slow and steady pace to work in favor of the characters, as the acting was top notch. So was the direction of the scenes, which were set up quite nicely. It was interesting to see such attention paid to both the victim and criminal's point of view. You could really understand the desperation, confusion, and obsession that Rex felt with his loss. In turn, you see cold evil in a form that does exist in our world. While maybe not shocking to all viewers, the ending is terrifyingly tragic, made so by the realism and calmness throughout the film. Just ask yourself, how would you feel if that happened to you?If pushed for a criticism, I would say that some of the symbolism seemed a bit too heavy handed but other then that, this is an intelligent, deep thriller. I have not seen the American remake (oddly enough, both versions are from director George Sluizer) but I can all but guarantee that the original is what you want to go with first. Many people suggest skipping the remake altogether!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't too many scenarios like this one. The original version and the Hollywood remake of this film were both directed by the same man, George Sluizer. As I understand from popular opinion, this is one film that was fine the first time round, and not well received on the second go. I cannot fairly compare them, and I have no more desire to see the remake of "Spoorloos" than I do the remake of "La Femme Nikita", namely "The Point Of No Return".I saw the original version upon the strong recommendation of a newspaper reviewer proclaiming it one of the most disturbing films they'd ever seen. The photograph of a young couple about to be torn apart in the paper reeled me in.A pleasant holiday excursion goes horribly wrong when a man's lady friend goes missing at a crowded rest stop. He grasps at straws in desperation as very little can be done because few clues or leads exist. The abduction is arbitrary and nearly flawless.The film was indeed well done and what struck me the most was the focus on that of the villain. It is a portrayal of a normal, respectable family man who trains himself in meticulous detail for an abduction. His cold, calculating approach is probably the most frightening aspect. His inhumanity is difficult to comprehend.Many film endings can be shocking and may stick with you forever, and for a lot of people that is certainly the case with this film. That's why I was surprised to learn that the TV commercials for this film gave away the ending. However it didn't ruin the film for me.The suspense and chilling setting of this film makes it hard to forget. The viewer constantly wondering, "What would I do?" or "How would I cope?". Impossible questions we all hope we'll never find the answer to.Of course, keep a few handy responses in mind should you watch this with your better half when they ask the inevitable, almost rhetorical question, "What would you do if I went missing and you couldn't find me?""I'd surely die, dear."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gave me nightmares for...well, I'm still having them. Rex and Saskia are a young couple on vacation. They stop at a gas station, Saskia goes inside and never returns. Rex becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her and, when at last faced with the man who abducted Saskia, finally has the chance to find out. But there's one condition: Rex must surrender himself to Saskia's abductor and agree to experience the same thing she herself went through. The only trouble is, he has no idea what that might be, or even whether Saskia is alive or dead. Rex believes that the Not Knowing is the worst thing, but it isn't. The Knowing is the most horrible thing of all.This is a powerful film that practically punches you in the stomach with its gritty realism. The performances are flawless and haunting, and the climax and aftermath, delivered with a quiet matter-of-factness, are the very definition of horror. This is real horror, the kind we try not to think about but which can happen, and has. If this film doesn't disturb you, I can't think of anything that will. Highly recommended, but only for people who are emotionally equipped to deal with the fear and the terror that the camera never flinches from. People with claustrophobia would be wise to stay far away from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a most unsettling and haunting film which vividly depicts the banality of evil. American filmgoers who are too lazy to settle in to the ambiance and mood of foreign films will probably not be patient enough for it, though. I went to see it not knowing at all what to expect, and really got a jolt. One factor that made it so powerful was the everyday reality of it all. These are seemingly normal people you'd see on the street anywhere. I thought it was a masterful depiction of what would probably actually happen when someone you loved just disappeared out of the blue, and the turmoil of emotions that would be unleashed. If you are at all susceptible, the ending will absolutely chill you to the bone, and is the perfect topper to a great film. Please do yourself a favor, and DON'T make the mistake of seeing the American remake instead of the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A European Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" is one of my favorite movies, probably in my top ten. I first saw it in 1990 in San Francisco. Without giving anything away, the end of this Dutch/French film contains an extraordinarily diabolical twist, and at the theater at which I saw it, the projector crapped out with about 15 minutes left. Everyone was issued a free pass to come back, which I did the next day, having barely been able to get the creepy story out of my head. I couldn't wait to see what happened at the film's conclusion. Fifteen years later, it still makes me shudder sometimes. The American remake with Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland should, in my opinion, be avoided at all cost; the ending was changed, no doubt to suit the bottom-line aspirations of some brain-dead producer. But the European original is full of great acting (particularly from the villain, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a tight storyline, and, of course, a wickedly brilliant ending. It's a film worthy of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> When I searched for "The Vanishing," all I could find was that abysmal "Americanized" version of the film starring Jeff Bridges. What a horrible mistake of a movie that was. Let's consider, instead, the original film in which a fellow and his girlfriend are on an outing when she vanishes without a trace. He becomes obsessed with discovering what happened to her. Whether he can be completely successful in his quest is the whole point of the movie. Why the original director would remake this little masterpiece in English with a Hollywood ending is completely beyond me. See the original. You won't soon forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about a highly disturbing man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer has made a movie that moves slowly forward, giving the viewer clues that work as pointers to take us back and forth in time. Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu as Raymond Lemorne depicts a man who knows the difference between right and wrong, but when he is 16, looking down from his parents veranda 15 feet above ground, he asks himself this question: Where is it predestined that I will not jump? And then he has to jump. This highly disturbing way of thinking moves him in a different direction. We see in his every day life that he is a most normal man, he has two daughters, a good wife, a job as a chemistry teacher. But he is something else too. Is he evil? This is a very disturbing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Day Edgar Allen Poe tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Poe, without a traceable motive, anyone can commit murder with impunity. Thats what this movie documents. A sociopath who for an insane reason he's in his head concocted, plans and executes the perfect crime. His victim's lover refuses to give up on her disappearance, and begs the culprit for a private meeting, just so he may learn the truth. I cant think of a more successful development of a movie villain. The guy is plain evil, successfully living a double life that his family suspects, but is inclined to think of as a trivial extramarital fling. In France extramarital goings on, i assume Are trivial. You quickly loathe the man. He's rather hideous to look at, and his superior manner gets under your skin. Film is very well done, and the two hours is well paced. Understanding the murderers motives even upon revelation is somewhat confusing, and i dont think it was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it with a friend when it was released. Then I went home and told my husband about it, and how impressed I was. He's not much of a moviegoer, but he's certainly sensitive to film: His favorites are The Third Man, Maltese Falcon, The Conversation-- all biggies. And when I rented "My Life as a Dog" and he started to watch it with me, he had to leave the room after the first ten minutes or so, saying, "This movie is going to be much too sad." Which, if you've seen that Lasse Hallstrom film, you know he pegged it.Anyway, he asked about the plot of "The Vanishing." I told him, he listened, and that was the end of it. Or so I thought.We're at a dinner party later that week, and I mention the movie. Someone asks about it, I start to describe it-- and my husband stops me. He says, "It's too disturbing to even hear the plot again."I never mentioned it again. Nor have I watched it again, and don't think I ever could. But I am forever glad that I saw it that first time. A gripping story that demands more emotion from the audience than almost any other film I can name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing and provocative, a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This review includes spoilers***This dark, brilliant film has been much-talked about since its release in 1988, and for good reason: only a few films have such immutable power, leaving you with mental images that stay with you for months or even years. This film's austere ending is a commentary on the prevalence of heartless evil in our society. Reduced to its simplest expression, there is no joy in nature. Make no mistake, this is an ugly film that you will only want to see once. I cannot imagine anyone finding the same degree of stark satisfaction from the sanitized 1993 American version, complete with a happy ending tacked on to appease nervous producers. Please don't see the 1993 version.Rex and Saskia are two young lovers on holiday, alternately loving and fighting as close couples are wont to do. Their flaws are revealed, making them more endearing: during the drive he becomes macho and demanding, while she rebels and becomes petty and shrill. After the fight, they are closer than ever. One cares about these characters, can imagine their lives together for years to come, possibly even getting married. She's earthy and fun-loving, while he is quietly appreciative of her company. Oddly, she presages the forthcoming events by recounting a strange dream about a golden egg. These two seem a perfect match. The sun sets on their short romance when they stop at a rest area and she disappears. He hangs around the rest area for hours, long into the night looking for her and trying to reconstruct her footsteps through the rest area. The sense of desperation and mystery lingers, and it shows in his pained expression. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one can identify with his quiet, desperate longing.Several years later, Rex is still obsessed with Saskia's disappearance. His romantic partner, realizing that she can never take Saskia's place, walks out on him. Rex appears on talk shows, canvasses neighborhoods with flyers, and revisits their favorite places in an attempt to understand just why Saskia disappeared. This part is important: Rex wants to understand the nature of evil, and in order to successfully get through this film without lying awake all night with the ending forever running in your head, it's important to acknowledge this aspect of his character.The film cuts to Raymond, the man who kidnaped Saskia: you might have imagined a raving maniac, but instead you see a gentle, kindly older teacher with a wife and son, living in a well-appointed flat and driving a Citroen; he might just as well be Pere Noel on summer holiday. This film is constructed like a crime scene investigation. First we experience the disappearance firsthand, and then we go into the mind and life of Raymond, showing how he coldly planned and carried out the kidnapping with as much emotion as changing the oil in his car. It is this two-part process which slowly builds the powerful suspense in this film. We see how methodical he is in his approach to the planned kidnaping, and, impossibly, we even laugh at him: looking for a victim, he inadvertently makes a pass at a young woman he knows, and she calls him on it, saying that he should be ashamed of himself. It is this twist of fate that drives him to kidnap a young woman from the rest area, where no one is likely to know him. So the fates have brought him Saskia.Aware of Rex's obsession, Raymond offers to meet him in a public place and show him what happened to Saskia. Suffice it to say that the mystery of Saskia's disappearance is frighteningly revealed at last; listen closely and you can almost hear God laughing in the soundtrack. Because of the strong ending, I would recommend seeing this film with at least one other person.There is nothing beautiful about this film; it is cold, ugly, and unfair. At the very least, maybe it will help you to understand the unreasonable nature of evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The banality of Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is probably my favourite genre, and I have seen a lot of horror movies. There were only a few movies that really left me as paralyzed and disturbed as this one. In the very beginning, the director masterfully lets you know that something is wrong, but you don't know exactly what and how bad it really is. You are left as clueless as the main character and through your own uncertainty you might get involved more than you think you would. The story is simple and the evil in it is banal, everything is so normal and so horrible at the same time. And it surely is the banality of evil and the tormenting uncertainty that make this movie almost unbearably creepy. The ending is absolutely, absolutely shocking and I still really don't like to think about it. If you don't like monsters, blood and pornographic violence and if you are looking for a smart, really creepy psycho-horror movie, this movie is for you. In my opinion, Spoorloos is what good horror is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Terrifying (may contain minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few horror movies that even slightly frighten me, and this is probably true for most grown-ups. The monsters in those films are caricatures, blatantly cartoon-ish villains that are one dimensional and, as mature people know, don't really exist. That's because most of the truly frightening monsters in real life wear clothes just like the rest of us, have normal jobs just like the rest of us and are often living right next door, usually appearing to be ordinary family men and women on the surface. They will wave at you or nod as you pass them, if that's the custom in your area, or perhaps they will just stroll quietly by you and you will never know the horrors they commit. Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killing cannibal, might have not gotten caught when he did if it weren't for that horrific stench of decaying corpses that permeated from his apartment; because on the surface he looked and acted just like a quiet, ordinary guy. And what scares us most of all, if we admit it or not, is not only how ordinary he seemed but that at one time he was just like us, he just started down a twisted, psychotic path somewhere along the way, a path any of us could have fallen into had we been in similar circumstances. The real monsters are in all of us. Fortunately, most of them are completely inactive which gives us, on the surface, most of the time, a fairly placid and uneventful life.Then you watch Spoorloos. It works so extraordinarily well because it feels like a documentary, a slice of life of the three main characters, Rex, Saskia and Raymond. Rex's girlfriend Saskia, just mysteriously vanishes and, being a realistic film, you see the horror, loss and near insane obsession such a loss would bring. You witness his wrenching emotions, excruciating emptiness and desperation in trying to discover someway, anyway to find her. And then you meet Raymond, the man who looks like an ordinary man with a seemingly happy family and, for no apparent reason, you realize he is responsible for Saskia disappearing from Rex's life. But what did he do with her? Surely this man, this seemingly ordinary man, could not have done anything terrible could he? What follows is the unfolding of a mystery that moves so painfully and methodically, developing into such a real horror story that you find yourself stunned when the credits roll. And what really is scariest of all, the character that sticks with you the most, is the monster. George Sluizer, the director, carefully leads you through the story from every character's perspective but the one whose eyes you see through the most, is the monster. You are left wondering "how could he?" "could I ever do something like that?" Like life, it does not have a neat, tidy happy ending but rather leaves you with too many disturbing questions of an extremely disturbing story. This is movie making and story telling at its best. Not in terms of incredible special effects or beautiful cinematography but understated, realistic acting of realistic characters and story. Spoorloos, along with Roman Polanski's "Repulsion" are the two most frightening movies I have seen for they have haunted me the most, due to their unflinching, realistic, disturbing stories.As a footnote, the director, George Sluizer, was paid a pile of money to direct a pile of crap, an American version of this story, the English title was also "The Vanishing" but this turd was made five years later (1993). Do yourself a great favor and do not confuse the two if you are renting, look for the Dutch/French version made in 1988. Also, if you run into the real monster from Spoorloos, or someone just like him, send him to meet Todd Graff, who wrote the Hollywood version and all the others responsible for that awful mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil that walks among us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the awful stuff that is going on in the world these days, writers often speak of evil and how it manifests itself. Terrorists, seen in cafes and unseen in airplanes, come out of dark places to render unimaginable death and suffering. Schoolkids suddenly kill each other for seemingly no reason, and without remorse. And the threat of things yet to come keeps the civilized world under a heavy cloud of fear.With that in mind, you would not want to watch this movie for escapist entertainment. It tells the story of a sociopathic individual, who kills without remorse, but also without motive. On top of that, he knows that he brings sadness and suffering, but it does not move him. He knows this, too. And it does not bother him.This is a good plot set-up, and the movie does an excellent job of telling its suspenseful story. You care about the characters, even the sociopath. You hold out until the end, because you want to know just as badly as the husband, what happened to his wife. And you find out, probably much to your chagrin. And then the movie is over. When I saw it, the folks leaving the theatre were exchanging looks of disbelief. In a fit of gallows humor, I chuckled to myself, and said to my girlfriend, "How can you end a movie that way?"Suffice to say that this movie will probably never leave your memory. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that sociopaths like the character in this movie do indeed exist in real life, and they do walk among us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scientific scrutiny of existentialistic question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this strange title, you may wonder if I really have seen the same film as the other commentators, who focus on the scary side of this film. I am the first to acknowledge this side of the film as well, where the scary aspects are created by the actual story, not an excessive use of gore. But the film contains a philosophical depth, which I chose to focus on here, hence the odd title.The film starts with a prologue, which as climax has the disappearance of the female in a young Dutch couple on vacation in France. The film then goes back in time, and we follow a French man and his odd behaviour (testing how long he is kept drugged by some chemical of certain volume, how well screams are heard from his house on the countryside by scaring his daugther with spiders, how he optimally should invite someone into his car, and even learning some English phrases with this purpose in mind). It is obvious that this man, for some unclear reason, want to kidnap a woman by drugging her in his car, and after several failures, we reach the point where the Dutch woman from the prologue is kidnapped by this French man.Then starts the third and final part of the film, where the kidnapper and the man from the Dutch couple, who want to know what happened to his girlfriend, eventually meet. In a car ride back to France, the two men talk and the purpose is revealed. The kidnapper is a man who want to know if he is able to perform the most gruesome act (in his opinion) to another person. Is he able to do evil? And he performs his inquire using the scientific method, that is, formulating a hypothesis, preparing and collecting data and then doing the "experiment" to confirm or reject the hypothesis. His preparations, described above, were hence not training in order to do the act effectively, instead they were part of the scientific scrutiny, the empirical data.The question "can I do the ultimate evil", is a variant of the existentialistic question, which (I think) Sartre was the first to point out, namely the fear we feel for our own freedom. Say when we walk over a bridge we feel scared by our knowledge that if we want, we could throw ourselves over the bridge and kill ourselves. We therefore tend to mentally put false restraints on our freedom, and rarely do a sane person follow the sudden impulse to find out the answer to whether we are able to do this. But not the kidnapper, who when he suddenly is faced with the question "can I do the ultimate evil", he proceeds to answer it scientifically. This is the unpassionate purpose of the kidnapping. The Dutch man is faced with another philosophical question with more passionate meaning towards the end, but that's another side of the film, which I do not comment on here.So finally, what is the gruesome act? Lets say that when we learn in passing that the kidnapper has extreme claustrophobia and therefore is allowed to ride a car without seat belt, well then we get a clue...A very good film! Scary, with depth and it gives the audience a lot to think about, and the actor who plays the kidnapper does so very convincingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant psycho drama, already a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer's magnificent European thriller remains as intelligent and haunting today as ever.While traveling across Europe, a couple stops at a service station where the woman disappears without a trace. Her boyfriend embarks on a desperate three year search hoping to learn who abducted her. In the meantime however we are introduced to the strange character of a gentle family man - who turns out to be the sly madman responsible.The Vanishing is one of the smartest and most chilling thrillers of modern cinema. It doesn't resort to violence, clichés, or conventional plot lines - but instead plays out its intriguing mystery premise by establishing its characters and their personal struggles. From there it builds a compelling plot of growing tension that escalates to a finale that is absolutely chilling and powerful. The conclusion is one of the most bold movie endings ever. Sluizer's direction is wonderfully stylish, using the lovely French locations to their full effect. Henny Vrienten's music score is nicely atmospheric and adds a perfect touch to the film's slick cinematography.The cast is another great highlight. Gene Bervoets does a dynamic performance as the man who struggles with his obsession to learn the fate of his missing girlfriend. Johanna ter Steege is captivating as the lost love of Bervoets. However the show is truly stolen by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu. Donnadieu is one of the most charismatic and fascinating villain characters ever. He's frightening, not for the typical reasons, but because he plays a weirdly heart-felt character that seems as normal as anyone. A real feat indeed.The Vanishing is a film that all horror/thriller fans should see. It's an outstanding modern genre classic that isn't only tasteful and gripping, but strikingly smart too.George Sluizer also directed an American remake in 1993, to much less effect. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Vanishing" when it was first released in the U.S., and walked out of the theater completely stunned. It stayed with me for days afterwards. A few years later, I saw it once again on cable. While I think it's one of the best and most frightening psychological thrillers of all time, I don't think I could bear to see it again -- it is simply too intense and depressing. This film really gets in your head.The plot is riveting in its simplicity, and the terrifying ending (which some have, incomprehensibly, criticized) follows logically, indeed inescapably, from the progression of the story. "The Vanishing" is a film about the banality of evil (illustrated by the character of Raymond Lenorme, well played by Bernard-Pierre Donadieux) and the power of obsession (Rex's quest to find out what happened to Saskia). It also poses an unanswerable question: which is the greater horror, never to know the truth about what happened to someone we love, or to know a truth that is too awful to contemplate? What would any of us have done?The American remake is certainly "dumbed down" -- it's not really THAT bad, but it's simply an average Hollywood thriller. It opens up the airlessly tight structure of the original plot by making the hero's new girlfriend (who barely appears in the original) a major character and playing up the new romance, and of course there is a Hollywoodized ending. The French/Dutch original is the real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly hyped boring travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a second warning that there are quite a lot of spoilers in this review. More than I usually give away.This film has been given so much praise it's almost obscene. So it's even worse when you discover it's all a bunch of pretentious nonsense. I thought the beginning was intriguing but after the first half hour I was struggling to stay awake. The characters were unattractive and tedious, especially the bad dude. I really couldn't be bothered with him or his dreary life. The "hero" was just as bad. There was nothing interesting about what he was doing either. And both their characters remained remote and un-developed throughout. The story - such as it is - was meandering drearily along with no-one really doing anything, so I started hitting the fast forward button. That's always a bad sign.Finally it seemed like something interesting was happening. The hero had the bad dude by the lapels..... he was actually showing a smidgen of character, a bit of personality &amp; gumption!!! Oh joy of joys!!! But it was short lived. He climbs into a car with the baddie and off they go and off the viewer goes back to snoozeville. Cue the seemingly endless monologue in the car from boring bad guy - the world's most annoying road trip. He's telling gormless bland inanimate hero some yawn-fest story about his lame past and eventually an even more boring exposition of how he kidnapped the mans fortunate girlfriend (I say fortunate b/c she at least was saved having to put up with this mind-numbing drivel) and his voice just goes on and on and I'm yelling "OH SHUT UP!!" at the screen. If it had been me in the car with the twerp I would have smacked him with a tire iron and driven myself back home long ago. *** Major spoiler ahead***But throughout it all our hero just sits there like a brain-dead sloth gaping at the bad dude. Maybe he'd gone into a boredom-induced coma. Anyway, struggling not to throw a brick through the screen I persevered till a bit where they finally get out of the car &amp; bad dude suggests to hero that he should let him do the same to him as he did to his girlfriend (ie drug him and bury him alive). Hero says "hiyuck!! Dat sounds like a cool idea!" and scoffs down the drugged drink and gets killed. What absolute nonsense. The ending wasn't "chilling" or clever or any of those other things people are saying. It was just stupid. No-one would do that. It makes no sense at all. Although I can see how being buried alive would be a more attractive proposition than having to drive all the way back home with Mr Personality gas-bagging about himself again.Don't waste your time on this one. And don't believe the hype - it's just people thinking it MUST be good coz it's foreign, has subtitles, has a lot of footage of people doing nothing of any real interest, is really depressing and has a sad ending. Beat yourself over the head with a blunt object instead. You'll get more out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dry subject matter turns into the most horrific movie I have ever seen. Absolute genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a token 10 out of ten to try and inflate the ratings for a movie I like. This is one of the few perfect movies I can honestly say I have ever seen.I'm a huge horror fanatic and I put off seeing this despite it being recommended time and time again because the subject matter is so mundane. This move is the only horror move I have ever seen move that transcended scary to downright shocking to my very soul.It was a very unique experience that no movie has ever duplicated before or since. Once it was over, i actually just sat there for about 10 minutes thinking about what I had just seen, it was only after pondering it for a bit that i realized that the pacing and just sheer implications of what i had just seen was probably the most disturbing and awful yet utterly brilliant and in a strange way beautiful thing I had ever seen because as others have stated, it couldn't have possibly ended any other way. The viewer won't want it to end any other way.Through impeccable pacing and direction George Sluizer manipulates the viewer in a way I never thought could be possible, it would be criminal to spoil ANYTHING from this movie but I found myself in the same conundrum the protagonist Rex finds himself in at the ending and rooting something yet at the same time dreading to see it's result, but I must see. I can't think of any ending to any movie that was more fitting and a better conclusion than the ending of Spoorloos.Fans of psychological horror, this more than anything is required viewing. I await the day that a film can make me feel the way this one did and frankly I doubt it will ever come.Bravo, and shame on you George for the abysmal American and Americanized remake that absolutely ruined this movie for so many people I know. This movie is a masterpiece and half the people I know will never be able to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever any conversation about creepy films comes up I always mention this one. Those who have seen it scream 'That film is incredible!' while the rest want to know the plot. Well the plot is very simple but even so undeniably intriguing. A couple stop at a petrol station and she goes in to get coffee. She never comes out. That's it. What then happens it that we see the third person involved in her fate and this is why the film really gets under your skin. It's the sheer normality of this character who constantly has to push himself, test himself to see how far he can go. This is the only film I have ever watched which has actually given me a sleepless night. I ended up pacing the flat unable to forget about the fate of the characters in my head. Unusual yes but this film really does give one nightmares. I saw it in 1991 and I have not seen it since. I don't particularly want to because I can still remember it vividly 16 years later. It really does not get any more effective than this. A real gem but keep it at arms length. It's a killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry guys, but I have a problem with the hype on this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Spoilers *** I saw this movie on DVD a few days ago, and I'm feeling confused, especially when I read so many good IMDb reviews about it.I won't bother everyone talking about the permanent cheesy synthesizer's music, so fashionable during the eighties? as well as I won't complain about the bad pieces of dialog and acting, except for Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, who passed away a few months ago - rest in peace Bernard-Pierre. Those are flaws you can see on many small ?or even big- budget movies.No, actually I had a problem with buying the whole thing, even if I happen to believe I'm some kind of a good viewer - a movie can take me wherever it wants to; it's very easy to hypnotize me.But I couldn't buy the idea of a lonely dude haunting almost every day the same highway gas station, looking for opportunities to abduct women (we know he goes there every day for his wife asks him about the significant number of kilometers rising daily on the car counter) without being noticed or pushed out.I couldn't buy this absurd abduction sequence where a silly young woman jumps into Donnadieu's car, and gets neutralized by chloroform?.in front of everybody.I couldn't buy Donnadieu's tedious and vague explanations about his own behavior (something like: are you a true hero, if you prove you're able to do evil? Or something like that, I didn't really get it, and where does that come from anyway? Some 19th century psychiatric garbage?) And to top it all, I couldn't buy the idea of a main character drinking a cup of drugged coffee *while being aware of it being drugged* because he wants to "know about everything and feel everything" concerning his girlfriend abduction, cup of coffee offered by the man who planned and operated the abduction! Come on man, go and find the cops! You've gathered enough information at this time for them to re-open the case and start to dig stuff up on Donnadieu's backyard! And there's a couple more I'm too lazy to write about, but you got my drift, I guess.To work as a good movie, I think a thriller has to follow up its own mechanic and logic, a bit like a swiss clock? Even if it tells a crazy or insane story, it will work just as long as it sticks to its inner rules.No logic and coherence in this one, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

We wonder, what happened to him/her, where did they go, who kidnapped him/her?! How can one trust sweet strangers (when in fact they are vile predators)?! This reminded ,me of a girl which my Dad knew named Roselind Ballingal who went missing in the summer of 1969! He walked into the Knysna Forest and never came back! What we saw in the movie happened to Roselind?!? No one knows but everyone presumes she is dead. But how did she die?You know, you get sick people out there and they first come across as friendly and then they lead you to your grave. One thing to remember is, to not obsess! Obsession is extremely dangerous when it becomes like this. It's so disturbing, I've feared about being buried alive and one cannot tell who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist.

		<fullReview>It is best not to know much about this movie before seeing it. It is sufficient to know that it is about a women who disappears and a man's obsession to try and find out what happened to her. This is not a sappy love story and it bears little resemblance to the pale American remake. Reading more about the story will ruin how it unfolds. It was well filmed and well acted. The ending is a shocker. I think reviewers who write a synopsis of the movie's plot do a disservice to people reading the review. The movie's story should unfold before a viewer. The enjoyment is in how the story is told. This is all the more true regarding "The Vanishing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything it should be (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film exemplifies many things I like to see in films but rarely get enough of. Often times in Hollywood films we get interesting concepts that never live up to their full potential. In The Vanishing we get a film that forgoes cheap thrills and pace to examine the characters involved in a very thought-provoking way and it manages to achieve a greater level of creepiness than most American films would. After having first watched this film I was looking around in all directions as I walked around and here's why. One of the first things that strikes you is the music. There's a deep base bottom and it doesn't overly-anticipate the moment but still highlights the film with an overtone of foreboding which is just magnificent. And as this word could apply to the film as a whole it is especially significant in the antagonist; subtlety. Played by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, Raymond Lemorne is a great villain because he's believable, well defined and most frighteningly in the end we even understand him and worse yet he seems real.Another thing this film has going for it is the way the film isn't told chronologically. We first see the vanishing and the desperate search in the first few hours, then we are introduced to Lemorn, peg him as the man, see his routine and see that three years have gone by. All through out the film we will skip through time for large periods. The disappearance of Saskia will be filled in over and over again until the actual events are seen through their entirety. And the last piece only falls into place at the very end. Amazingly, with this unusual structure the film is not hard to follow in the least and certainly much more intriguing then the conventional linear plot we're used to seeing in the United States. The 'reality' of these events are set up in many way by director George Sluizer. Firstly there was great used of subjective camera and the 'Zero Degree Style' common in the States is completely abandoned. The other touches of reality come as we delve into the two main characters: Rex and Raymond. Raymond, the criminal, is first only seen in a very one dimensional manner. We see him a s a fraud who seems to be scoping out the store for possible victims. Then later in the story we see him begin to formulate his plan, to perfect it over and over again. The one scene where we see him as a biology teacher is just enough to show us that these people could be anyone and can fool you so easily. There is also the scene where Rex is waiting for him at the restaurant. Rex says he's waiting for Mr. Montmejan and that happens to the waiter's name. The commonness of the name adds profound statement about the plausibility of the plot. The tension of the film is also aided by McGuffins, or botched attempts by the professor. In one scene we see him pick up a young girl, we know already that him locking the door is where he makes his move and poisons the girl but it's his daughter. He also runs into a former student of his and tried to get her in his car and we see a chilling example of how he may have escaped justice for so long for even when someone calls him on it their content to just get away. There's also the scene where Raymond is out of focus in the background as Rex looks around for him. This is also another great scene of anticipation. Rex's relationship with Lieneke and also his quest are also quite believable. He reaches a point where all he seeks to know is the truth. The Vanishing is also greatly helped by some really good dialogue. The image of the Golden Egg as related by Saskia through her dream sort of predestines the film in a way as we'll see they both have the same fate, however, that is not a fault of the film. I firmly believe that there are only so many ways a story can end and it's not how it ends that always matters but how you got there. The Vanishing is a toned down psychological-thriller that'll get under your skin. It's a film that's had my imagination captive for a week. It's not only a prime example of a psycho-thriller but also of well-structured and executed character studies. It's a great achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary and Frightening Horror Film With a Hard-Hitting Conclusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Vanishing", or "Spoorloos" (its original Dutch title) tells the story of Rex Hofman (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), who is on a carefree road trip with his girlfriend, Saskia (Johanna ter Steege). After breaking down inside a tunnel, the two make their way to a busy truck stop in the French countryside, and Saskia goes inside to grab a few things. But when she fails to return to the car, panic ensues, and Rex begins a frantic search for his missing girlfriend. Three years later, Saskia is still missing, and the abductor, Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a cool-facaded college professor, begins contacting Rex, promising to tell him the truth of what he did to Saskia... but Rex, desperate for answers, finds himself in a situation more horrifying than he could have ever imagined.I'd heard of "The Vanishing" before, and how it was hailed as a psychological chiller classic, but I had no idea that the version that I was aware of was actually a remake of a 1980s French/Dutch film. That is, until I mistook this movie for the 1993 American version at the video store. When I took it home and began watching, I immediately realized this was the original French film, but I'm extremely happy that I made this mistake. Why? Because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to watch this excellent movie. I have yet to see the American remake of the film, so I cannot compare the two, but I can easily say that I found this to be one of the most effective psychological horror films I've had the pleasure of seeing.Truly worthy of the Hitchcockian label, "The Vanishing" weaves a tale that is both frightening and dramatic. When the film begins, it gets off slowly. Nothing much happens for a good thirty minutes, but we, the audience, already know something bad is coming in the way of our characters. And when that moment happens, it's scary because of how realistically depicted it is. Everything in this film is realistic, and I think that gives it a lot of power. The characters, their actions, their rationale - it all seems so human, and it is easy to sympathize with them. After Saskia has vanished, the rest of the film focuses on both Rex and Raymond, and the mind games that Raymond begins with Rex, who is desperately seeking the truth. The themes in this film are relate-able as well - the loss of a loved one and the desperate need to find the truth behind what happened to them. All of this is natural human reaction, but the situation in which it's placed is unusually and sufficiently frightening.The imagery in the film is lyrical, the camera-work excellent, and the symbolism effective. It's an atmospheric movie and this is another one of its large benefactors. It leaves its audience in a surreal, somewhat depressed state, and a film that can do that has got to have achieved something worthy of recognition. The acting is great, Donnadieu plays a role reminiscent of Rutger Hauer's performance in "The Hitcher", and Bervoets is convincing as the Rex character, desperate in finding answers. Johanna ter Steege is also great as Rex's ill-fated girlfriend, Saskia. As for the much-talked-about-ending, all I can say is "Wow". I didn't see it coming, and it isn't anything remotely like your typical story conclusion. It, as well as the rest of the film, is depressing, dark, and somber, and while I wouldn't call it a "twist" (because it really isn't), it's still extremely effective.Overall, "Spoorloos", or "The Vanishing" is a surreal and scary film. The story is near genius and worthy of a Hitchcock status, and the movie is extremely well-made. For fans of slow-going, almost dreamlike psychological horror films, "The Vanishing" is an absolute must-see. It leaves you with a strange, unsettling feeling in the pit of your stomach, and poses a thought provoking question- how far would you go to discover the truth? Perhaps sometimes the truth is better left unknown. I can't stress enough that filmgoers should not be put off by foreign-language movies. If you're too lazy to handle subtitles, then you will miss out on excellent films like this and many, many others. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a few dutch movies that I would recommend, but this is one of them. A couple, Saskia and Rex stop at a gas station. But Saskia never returns after she walks into the gas station. She seems to have vanished without a trace. In the following years, Rex desperately find out what has happened to her. Here the horror hits home. This could happen to anyone!The movie can be characterized as a psychological thriller. Although the abductor is a sociopath and a serial killer, there are no gory, bloody scenes in it.The character of the serial killer, Raymond, is well developed. He is a french chemistry teacher. Eccentric, yes, but well-adjusted and a family man. No one suspects that he is a serial killer, but we know that in the back of his mind he is carefully planning his murders. This is the best "serial killer" character I have ever seen (better than "Hannibal" in my opinion). Interesting detail: We find out that Raymond is claustrophobic when he is pulled over by police. He is allowed not to wear a seat belt because of this. (This detail is not in the book though.) This makes the murders even more gruesome.Rex is another interesting character. He becomes totally obsessed by Saskia's disappearance. So much, that he chooses an almost certain death just to find out what happened to her. Some may think that it is very unlikely that anyone would do this, but I disagree.By the way, don't watch the American remake. It may be OK, but having watched the original first it was a big disappointment. Jeff Bridges does not come close to the brilliant french serial killer!</fullReview>

Surely the ending that every viewer finds so profoundly unsettling only works because the rest of this beautifully crafted film leads us to expect a quite different ending. 'Spoorloos' is not only the most genuinely chilling movie I've ever seen, it is a good contender for Best Film Of the 80s.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a terrifying thought, having a loved one vanish without a trace. One moment you're together, and then you're not. You turn your head for just a second and she's gone. Panic sets in; you check everywhere, question everyone, go over every detail until your head hurts and still nothing makes sense. You feel nauseous and frustrated and then the fear settles in. It's getting dark-- now what do you do? File a missing person's report that eventually leads nowhere. Your significant other is reduced to a mere statistic. You wait and wait for closure, but it never comes. Three agonizing years pass. It is now an obsession, an obsession that consumes your entire life. There is no evidence, no pattern and no body. Your life is put on hold until you find the answer. The task seems daunting in that only by shear luck will you ever know the truth. Then one day your persistence pays off and you stumble upon a stranger, a stranger who knows something. Is he the murderer or just a lunatic? Do you take the chance? Is the risk worth knowing the truth? This unnerving dilemma besets the protagonist Rex in George Sluizer's 1988 cinematic masterpiece The Vanishing. What I found most intriguing and refreshing about this film was the seemingly benign approach it creates allowing the terror to build gradually. The central characters, a Dutch couple Rex and his girlfriend Saskia, are average looking and behave in unspectacular fashion, laughing, arguing as most couples do. They are traveling to France for a vacation.The opening scenes establish the happy couple; an ominous turn ensues when they stop at a gas station and Saskia disappears. As Rex searches for her in panic, he learns that she was last seen leaving with another man. Three years pass and Rex is still searching. His obsession consumes him, sabotaging his relationship with another woman. Then everything switches gears, with the entire second half of the film focusing on Raymond Lemorne, the kidnapper. It seems an odd technique to use (showing the villain throughout) but it works extremely well as we examine his perspective. It is here that The Vanishing establishes itself as a thriller that will be unlike all the rest, as Raymond is presented as a frightening but complex villain. A successful teacher with a loving wife and two daughters, strange only in his dullness, his monstrous desires are nourished by the fact that he sees himself as a resident above suspicion and therefore undetectable. He's a chameleon, an everyday man, who looks like the guy next door. This is what makes this film so effective and disturbing. Here is a culprit who blends in so well he can never be caught. He is very intelligent, yet imperfect. There are scenes in this movie both comic and unsettling at the same time. We observe as Raymond acts out his kidnapping scheme, and then pitifully attempts to bait young women into his car without any luck. His plan constantly fails until he meets Saskia.At first this film does not portray itself as suspenseful, but develops tension so calmly that by the time it is over, you're left exhausted. George Sluizer's genius direction comes from the idea of playing with the audience's nerves, letting anxiety build as we learn what ultimately happened to Saskia. Yet when the reality sets in, and the truth is revealed we almost wish the movie hadn't told us, just like Rex, who had his life destroyed by Saskia's unsolved vanishing, comes to the realization that maybe he would have been better off not knowing either. Similar to the pieces of a puzzle, the story gradually connects. It stays riveting from start to finish, psychologically absorbing the whole audience. When Raymond offers a chance for Rex to see Saskia again, he must first experience what she went through, and you're left wondering "Where the hell is this going to take us next?" The movie moves so subtly towards its shocking conclusion, that when it comes, we believe it. Unlike the usual "conventional" twist ending, The Vanishing pulls off the extremely complex act of seeming both shocking and inevitable, leaving you with a finale that will genuinely leave you numb for days.-Myles</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching TV this morning and saw a few minutes of the (far inferior) American version of this film, and asked myself why I was watching this when I have the original on DVD? So, I put on Spoorloos, and although I've seen it a few times before, it once again grabbed my interest, and I noticed, right away, a few details that make this version far superior to its American counterpart.First of all, foreign films usually have an advantage to me by casting foreign actors with whom I am not familiar. In this case, by not being a familiar face, the character of Raymond Lemorne came across as even scarier...he looked like a normal guy that I might meet on the street. In the American version, you have Jeff Bridges looking crazy, playing crazy, and ya just know to stay away! Also, I love the running coverage of the Tour De France playing in the background during the scenes where the girlfriend goes missing. It parallels some of the situations that both of our leading guys are going through....and it's cool that Rex is wearing a yellow jersey (like the Tour leader) during those frantic scenes while he looks for Saskia. This yellow jersey, and all the references to Saskia's dream of the 'golden egg' (like Rex asking her to peel the orange, and her golden foam knitting-needle cover) just bring a sense of unity to the whole piece.Many people here have written about the ending, which I think is brilliant. I was surprised that the American version (which was also directed by Sluizer, by the way) really copped-out on the ending. Rex was really losing it during those 3 years after Saskia's disappearance, and he was no good to his new girlfriend (who says at one point that she doesn't want to be part of a menage a trois), and no good to himself. His obsession had taken him over, and since he was willing to risk it all to find out what happened to Saskia, then he had to lose it all. Not a happy ending by Hollywood's standards, but it made more sense in the story.So, if you're considering seeing one of the two versions, please do yourself a favor, and go with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Stupid Can You Get?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a year ago I watched the remake of this Hitchcockian European production, the remake with Jeff Bridges. I thought the performances were okay but the story itself was brainless and depressing. If anything, this version, the original, is worse.Okay. A young Dutch couple, Bervoets and ter Steege, are in France on holiday. They stop for gas at one of those highway pull offs with stores and markets and so on. The chipper and pretty ter Steege goes into one of the stores to get some coffee and she never returns. Bervoets finds that no one is particularly interested in his girl friend's disappearance. There is no evidence regarding her disappearance.But Bervoets is obsessed by it. He borrows money and publicizes his plight on television, begging the man she was seen talking to, to come forward and explain what happened. Bervoets doesn't hate the man, he just wants closure.Three years pass and the man, Donnadieu, shows up. He stops Bervoets in a parking lot, says, "I'm the man you're looking for," and when Bervoets is finished beating the hell out of him, he offers to put Bervoets through the same experience as his girl friend, so he will know her fate and the mystery will be over. Yes, it will involve a long drive and the willing consumption of a drugged drink but at least the uncertainty will be gotten rid of.Guess what. Bervoets is angry but resolved to find out what happened -- so he agrees.There is a lot of philosophical poppycock about there being no such thing as predestination and if you pretend to do something it has the same effect as actually doing the thing.All the cogitation can be dumped or buried alive because this is the story of a psychopathic murderer and an extremely stupid victim. Donnadieu has the morals of Ted Bundy and Bervoets the intellect of a not particularly bright chimpanzee. It ends in an Edgar Allan Poe-ish nightmare.Again, there's nothing wrong with the performances. Donnadieu couldn't be a better Nobody. He's a chemistry teacher with an unsightly little beard and a constant vacuous smile. Bervoets is handsome and intense. Ter Steege is a shapeless, cute red head.But this is an unpleasant movie that leads to a conclusion so horrifying that it becomes ridiculous. Watch it, if you like this sort of stuff. You'll at least discover that the highway pull offs in France are the equal in ugliness of anything sprawled alongside an American interstate highway.Yuk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Sluizer's "Spoorloos" (called "The Vanishing" in English) is not like any movie that you've ever seen. It initially focuses on the disappearance of a Dutch tourist (Johanna ter Steege) at a gas station and how her boyfriend (Gene Bervoets) searches for her for years...but then it changes. The focus then shifts to the perpetrator (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), and we see how he leads what appears to be the most ordinary life. He could be your best friend. And finally, the movie's ending is a real shocker.I read that the movie is based on an urban legend about a girl who gets separated from her mother, but then no one recalls having ever seen her mother. In that sense, the movie deals with despair. How would you cope if this happened to you? Still, what we learn about the perpetrator is what truly makes this such a good movie. It poses the question of how well anyone truly knows anyone else. There was apparently an American remake of this movie, but I'll just avoid that one. But I do recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Dutch version well worth your while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer recently remade this, his own original Dutch version, in America with Kiefer Sutherland and Jeff Bridges. A more audience pleasing, action type film, it was quite an entertaining work.The original is set in France as we find two young Dutch people, Rex Holfman and his 'friend' Saskia, on the way to a little hideaway in rural France. Their pleasant little getaway takes a cruel turn when Saskia disappears at a highway road stop. After a desperate three year search, Rex is confronted by Raymond, a man who claims to be the abductor.The storyline is a lot more realistic than the re-make, with Sluizer simply using the two main characters to involve his audience, by first allowing us to obsess along with Rex about the whereabouts of his lost love, and secondly by slowly introducing us to the disturbed Frenchman Raymond.Lead players Gene Bervoets, Johanna ter Steege and support are very good as is Sluizer's thoughtful direction, while the plot unfolds itself at a well judged pace. And the ending, which is quite different to the more recent film, is a much more suitable, believable and disturbing one. This superior 1988 Dutch movie is well worth your while.Sunday, January 23, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an unusual tack, the movie reveals the likely perpetrator almost immediately.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer directed the brilliant, unforgettable Dutch/French suspense flick Spoorloos aka The Vanishing (not to be confused with the wretched 1993 American remake, which he was also directed--difficult as that is to fathom), a potent, haunting, and impressively nuanced thriller. . As for the original, it remains a remarkably effective psychological thriller and an obvious influence on films as diverse as Breakdown, Joy Ride and With a Friend Like Harry. Not to mention, the theme of disappearance has been attempted by many great directors (Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes), but it has never been done as spooky as it is here. It belies how strange life is and how relevant our dreams are.The film begins with a young Amsterdam couple on vacation in the south of France. They have apparently not been together for a long time as they are still getting to know each other, getting in tune with each other's rhythms. At one point Saskia relates to Rex a terrifying recurring dream she can't explain, which really haunts her when their car runs out of gas in the middle of a deep tunnel. Later, they stop at a park for a short time, and Saskia decides to go into a convenience store to get drinks. But she never returns. After awhile, Rex naturally becomes frantic and goes to the police.Suddenly the film shifts its focus to the story of Raymond, an ordinary family man, a teacher who is also a self-absorbed intellectual. He is obsessed with the idea of good vs. evil and sets out to experiment with the possibility that he might have an evil side he has never tapped. How Raymond's experiments tie into Saskia's disappearance makes for a fascinating game that eventually takes on cat-and-mouse proportions ? but does not go down the roads you will expect.This film is so well-crafted, that it is easy to get carried away and think that more is being said than what has transpired. But in the simplicity of its story, it becomes easy to identify with the Amsterdam couple and feel caught up in their dreamworld which intermingles with their real-life. A film that is very much in the Hitchcock suspense mode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I dint hear about the movie until I saw the top 100 horror flicks from IMDb. Once I got my hands on this one, it was a hard choice not to see it. Well the movie was a simple and good one. Definitely disturbing for the 80's but owing to too much of violence and blood splattering movies it might not be too shocking for present day audience. This movie is different from other kidnap movies because we know all the time who is involved in it. Only difference is the relentless pursuit of Saskia's boy friend to know what happened to her. Well the tension and surrealness of the situation is very nicely shown by the lead actors and panache and effortless kidnapping of saskia is amazing. Definitely a good movie, but something seriously short making it not a contender for a great movie. Still deserves a good 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of the best European films of all time. I was a bit disappointed at first, because I thought that having to read subtitles would ruin the movie for me, but it didn't at all. Vanishing had everything: suspense, comedy, horror, a little romance, good acting, beautiful locations, a great villain and a perfect ending. The suspense had me glued to the screen the entire time and the final scene beats any ending in American motion picture history. I recommend this to any fan of Hitchcock or if you liked Psycho or American Psycho. Although I haven't seen the American remake of it, I doubt I will, because there's no such thing as a good remake of a classic like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Starting out on a summer biking vacation in France Dutch couple Rax Hoffman and Saskia Wagter, Gene Bervoets &amp; Johanna Ter Steege,have their spats as the car their driving runs out of gas, in the middle of a mountain tunnel. Rex leaving Saskia alone walks to the nearest gas station to get a jerry can of gasoline. Coming back to the stranded car Rex doesn't find Saskia and getting in the car and driving out of the tunnel he sees her waiting for him outside. You get the impression that the two are on the outs but later their back together as if nothing happened but something terrible is about to happen to them and it's strikes the unsuspecting couple at a time and place that they would least expect it to.Stopping at a crowded gas-station and food rest stop Saskia leaves Rex for what would be just a moment to buy some refreshments and is never seen or heard from again. It's as if she just stepped off the face of the earth and fell into a black hole in space. Based on the Tim Krabbe novel "The Golden Egg" the film "The Vanishing" is about how a person can come up with, and execute, the most evil acts imaginable and at the same time come across totally normal to not only himself but to everyone around him.Raymond Lemorne, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, is a loving family man and chemistry professor but suffers from an obsession of wanting to know if the sick acts that his mind conjurer's up can also be put into practice. Since he was 16 Lemorne has had thoughts of committing murder just to see how it feels. Now in his mid 30's he's about to make his "wish" come true at the expense of Saskia Wagter but what he didn't expect is how it would effect her friend and lover Rex Hoffman.We know from the start that Lemorne was somehow responsible for Saskia's disappearance seeing him hanging around the gas station eying her, as well as a number of other young women, before she vanished. It was the three or so years after Siskia's vanishing that got to the morbid and deranged Lemorne working overtime. It was Rex not letting Saskia's name out of the news that somehow started to get under Lemorne's skin.Finally getting up enough courage to finally face Rex back in Holland showing him proof, Saskia's car-keys, and then getting his a** kicked in among other things. Lemeorne then gets the now somewhat sedated and curious young man to drive back with him to France to the gas station where Saskia was last seen alive by him some three years ago. We get a chilling minute-by-minute flashback to what happened to Saskia at the gas station from Lemorne himself as he cleverly got her to get in his car, in a crowded area in broad daylight, and then knocking her out with a chloroform-laced handkerchief and driving off with her.Rex desperately wanting to find out from Lemorne what happened to Saskia goes along with his sick game of cat and mouse that leads to this dark and deserted park outside a gas station. It's where where Lemorne gives him a cup of coffee laced with sleeping pills to put Rex, who willingly goes along with it, into the same condition that he put Saskia in three years ago. Rex at first hesitates but his curiosity gets the best of him and drinks the brew falling into a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out the truth of what happened to his beloved Saskia but at the cost of his life.Not at all pleasant to watch "The Vanishing" is the kind of movie that leaves you both physically and mentally numb and is undoubtedly one of the most chilling horror films to come out in the last fifty or so years; rivaling such horror classics of the 1960's and 1970's like "Psycho" and "The Exorcist". The fact that "The Vanishing" is so unconventional in it's story-line and has such unique characters in it that it's for that and that very reason alone, more then anything else, the movie has had over the years such a disturbing and devastating effect on it's audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chilling, the moving, and the haunting "The Vanishing".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot to this one is simple enough, a very much in-love young man, Rex, takes his eyes off his girlfriend Saskia for a fateful couple of minutes, and she mysteriously vanishes forever. Fast forward to 3 years later, and the disappearance has taken it's toll on the devastated Rex. He can accept that his girlfriend must be dead by now. But it's the not knowing how it happened which is tearing him apart. Thus Rex is completely unable to move on with his life, until one day a stranger makes contact with him, offering to show him what happened to Saskia, but only if he is willing to suffer the same fate as she did; whatever that might be.That such a simple idea works as a movie is down to it's believability; the events of this movie could easily happen to you and your loved ones. After all, hundreds of people disappear in real life everyday, and not always because they bump into a ridiculously over-the-top villain, with a patch over one eye, a scar on his cheek and an evil hissing voice.Sometimes, as here, the villain of the piece may be a successful but ordinary family man, surrounded by unsuspecting loved ones of his own, who has no great need or motive to inflict suffering on others, but decides to do so anyway, just to see what it feels like. And it is the pointlessness of that act that makes it all the more chilling.Furthermore the movie works because of the genuine chemistry between the two leading parts, who play the lovestruck Rex and the happy-go-lucky, delightful, but ill-fated Saskia. Not since I watched the death of Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks has film so successfully conveyed such a sense of loss over the disappearance of a bright young life.In summary, The Vanishing is a very moving picture, which will reward film fans who understand that the everyday evil inherent in mankind is far more believable and haunting than the CGI from any Hollywood creature feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film About Abduction, Quite Tense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege), a young couple in love, are on vacation in France. They stop at a busy service station and Saskia is abducted. After three years and no sign of Saskia, Rex begins receiving letters from the abductor.This is quite an interesting film. While it relies on a similar theme as Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" and Robert Fuest's "And Soon the Darkness", it has quite the unique edge. I love that the story of both the boyfriend and the abductor are told. And not so we can sympathize with the abductor -- in fact, his motives become even more mysterious the more we know. It seems to be a Leopold and Loeb situation, but is never made explicit.The film is great all along, but gets especially tense once the two men meet. What game is the abductor playing? Will the girl be found -- and if yes, alive or dead? So many questions. What would you do if you were in the same situation? Call the police? Take the chance? Kill the man?Notably, the score from Henny Vrienten really hits hard, despite being mostly simple, basic tones. This is not the music you expect from Vrienten, given his background as part of a 1980s ska band.Roger Ebert wrote, "One of the most intriguing things about The Vanishing is the film's unusual structure, which builds suspense even while it seems to be telling us almost everything we want to know." So true. We see the abductor planning his crime well before it even happens!A remake came a few years later (1993) with Jeff Bridges, Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland, again directed by George Sluizer. I have not seen it, but based on the reviews, the original is the version to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Dark Fate that Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saskia is such a charming, winsome girl, it's no wonder boyfriend Rex can't get over her disappearance. He's obsessed, but then he left her alone once in the dark, and is fated never to repeat that first abandonment. A superior suspense film, tightly written, well thought out, and very well-acted, especially by Johanna Ter Steege as Saskia on whose performance the film turns. Bernard Donnadieu as the chemistry professor is also subtly effective, the very embodiment of what some call the 'banality of evil'-- a peculiarly passive, even bumbling mastermind, but also a shrewd and conniving opportunist. The family scenes of him at one calculated remove from loving wife and daughters are perhaps the most chilling of an extremely disturbing movie. The unfolding story is not always easy to follow, but rewards are great. Philosophical themes are present but not in obtrusive or heavy-handed manner. Screenplay manages to combine these with dark psychological study such that elements come hauntingly together in final five minutes. It's a movie whose central ironies may not come into focus unless you think about the various threads. I would think more of director George Sluizer's role in fashioning this sleeper were it not for the moment-of-decision scene in the park. Hyping that scene with phony thunder and lightning is totally unnecessary and at odds with the film's naturalistic style. It is a stagey distraction, and for that slip-up, the director must take ultimate blame. I can't help but wonder what Hitchcock would have made of the material, particularly the peculiar bond between boyfriend Rex and tormentor Donnadieu. But then, he would likely have replaced the metaphysical aspect with more psychological study, whereas to me it is the successful combining of the two that makes the film so intriguing. Highly recommended for those who understand that there's much more to fear in life than gallons of splattered blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a movie brands itself in to your head so deeply, so indelibly, there are three possible options that follow: Watch it again, show it to a friend who's never seen it, or comment about it on the IMDb. 'The Vanishing' or 'Spoorloos' in Flemish is one of those rare movies that don't leave you weeks after you've watched it, and even manages to haunt you in your sleep. That's a lot more than could be said for most horror or thriller films made today.It's genius lies in it's simplicity: a man and woman stop at a gas station on their way to a vacation get-away, his wife goes to the bathroom and the man goes to fill up his car. When the man is reappears, his wife is no longer there, she is gone, without a trace. This is the catalyst for a life-long search for answers, answers which the viewer are given access to early on in the film, but that remain a mystery to the main character until the very end. The story relies on tactful Hitchcockian logic to propel it through to its disturbing finale; an ordinary man becomes caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and becomes our eyes and ears to a world that is all very real and upside down - this story COULD happen, and it could happen to YOU. The main character only serves as our conduit to this world as he spirals further and further into the darkness that is a purely evil human soul. This film is deserving of comparison with Hitchcock's greatest films and Claude Chabrol's "Le Boucher", as the director plays very well on the suspense instrument to guide us through, even though we know enough to have the entire story figured out by the end of the first twenty minutes. Truly simple and disturbing film. Avoid the remake at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down to Earth, but in the end, creepy like few others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young couple from Amsterdam, Rex and Saskia, are on a road trip in France. They stop at a highway rest stop for gas and when Saskia goes to get some drinks... she never returns. This leads Rex to literally bury himself in an obsessive search to find out what happened to Saskia. Then one day he is contacted by a man who claims to be responsible for her disappearance.Like many movies produced outside of Hollywood this is a thriller that almost wholly abandons sensationalism. There is almost no violence, save for one fight scene. The depiction of obsession is very down to earth - no alcoholism, bizarre hallucinations - and surprisingly the cinematography is also not very "thriller-esque" for lack of a better word. There are nicely lit sunny days and restrained thriller music, yet the tension remains due to the good performances. For instance, the depiction of the sociopath is one of the most chilling due its overt harmlessness. Hollywood tends to straight out vilify the "bad guys" with messy appearances, bad childhoods, and so on. But this film shows the "bad guy" as a mild-mannered family man who works as a chemistry teacher and certain events in his life, shown through flashback, led him to become curious about several things, namely murder.With the overall normal and everyday look and feel to the film, many people will be able to relate to the settings, but after watching this film you'll definitely think about just what could happen from stopping at a service station or sitting in a café. It's down to Earth, but in the end, creepy like few other movie's on the shelf next to it. 9/10Not rated, but contains mature themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes You Into A True Arena of Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disturbing movie that will take you into realms usually reserved for Poe and Lovecraft, `The Vanishing,' directed by George Sluizer, is a dark tale that takes you into the twisted mind of a man named Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), with implications that are truly frightening. While on vacation, a young couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege), stop at a crowded rest area. While he fills the car with gas, she goes into the store for some drinks. And she never comes back. And, lest the scenario seem too improbable or implausible, Sluizer proceeds to take you back through the days preceding the mysterious disappearance; and once you meet Raymond, you begin to understand what happened, and how. And when you finally know, it's as terrifying as anything you could possibly imagine. On the surface, Raymond appears to be a rather `normal' individual; he's married, with two children, and teaches science. He and his wife, Simone (Bernadette Le Sache), have recently purchased a country home which they are gradually restoring, and spend some time there with their children whenever they can. But hidden beneath Raymond's reserved and respected exterior is a sociopath capable of actions so heinous it defies comprehension. Leading up to the day of the vanishing, the film alternates between scenes of Rex and Saskia vacationing, and Raymond, as he methodically plans and calculates his cold-blooded crime. And it's chilling, watching him prepare and fine-tune each step so matter-of-factly, as if he were staking out a new garden or planning a picnic with the family. It's unsettling, watching Rex and Saskia going about their business, blissfully unaware of the terror that awaits them. What puts the real bite into the impact of this film is the way it's presented; this is no boogeyman-in-the-closet or `slasher' type horror film-- it goes way beyond that and takes you into a very real world of very real horror. Early on, of course, you know that Raymond is responsible for Saskia's disappearance. But don't have a clue as to what he's done with her or where she is-- dead or alive-- until the very end of the film. The second half of the film concentrates on Hofman's obsessive quest to find out what happened to Saskia. Three years have elapsed, and he still doesn't have a clue (and neither does the audience at this point). Then something happens, something is revealed, and you follow along with Rex as he pursues the single clue he's been given after all this time. And as you watch him desperately trying to uncover the truth, you begin to hope with all your heart that he does. Because after a point it becomes excruciatingly clear that if he fails, you'll never know what happened, either. Ter Steege lends an earthy vitality to the role of Saskia, with a performance that is entirely convincing and very real. Bervoets does a good job as well, credibly expressing the myriad emotional levels that Rex experiences. And Donnadieu, as Raymond, is absolutely disconcerting, exhibiting an off-handed nonchalance that evokes the image of a lion patiently stalking his prey. The supporting cast includes Gwen Eckhaus (Lieneke), Tania Latarjet (Denise), Lucille Glenn (Gabrielle), David Bayle (Raymond at 16), Roger Souza (Manager) and Caroline Appere (Cashier). A sobering film that kind of sneaks up on you, `The Vanishing' does what most horror movies never really do-- it makes your skin crawl. The ending is rather startling in it's simplicity; it may even leave you nonplused for awhile. But once you've had some time to think about it and assimilate what actually happened, be prepared for a sleepless night or two. This is one that just isn't going to leave you alone. I rate this one 9/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and thought-provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most discussion around this film centres on the ending (which I'm not going to give away, don't worry!), but, to me, this is far from being the focal point. True, I do like non-Hollywood endings (see "The Wicker Man"), but I think this movie simply MUST end the way it does. It is the logical conclusion, as all the themes in the story are pulled together.Two key themes are those of coincidence and predestination: The series of events that conspire to ensure that Saskia becomes the victim, causes us to ponder the fragile nature of all human existence; The key scene in the film is the flashback to when, as a child, Raymond jumped from a balcony simply to prove that his free-will could overcome predestination or the rules of conventional behaviour. This is sociopathic behaviour, rather than psychopathic, but potentially just as dangerous. This leads on to what I think is the main theme of the movie, namely the almost limitless capacity of human beings to perform extraordinary acts. Whether they be motivated by passion, obsession or cold-blooded decision.The screenplay is adapted from a story called "The Golden Egg", and the literary origin is reflected in the fractured time line in the narrative, and the slow, sparse nature of many of the scenes, including lots of silence (a staggeringly effective device, which Hollywood seems to have completely forgotten about), in which to ponder the abovementioned themes. This is about as far as it is possible to get from an action-packed, score-driven, star-name-laden blockbuster - like a cool, green oasis in a featureless desert.The three main characters are all splendidly acted, particularly Saskia, which is a shame since she doesn't feature that much. Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu as the frighteningly ordinary Raymond, creates a most memorable and believable villain. The scene in which Raymond finally initiates his abduction by chloroforming Saskia, with the camera fixed on her face as realisation, panic and despair appear in her eyes, is the most chilling and horrific thing I've ever seen on a movie screen. A haunting, thought-provoking and original masterpiece.P.S. Goodness only knows what possessed George Sluizer when agreeing to direct the remake - presumably a VAST amount of money, but it would've been nice to think that there was still such a thing as artistic integrity or, at least, personal dignity (the same question arises with Robert Rodriguez's remaking of "El Mariachi").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing and subsequently haunting horror/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those unimpressed by SPOORLOOS are probably simply unused to seeing a horror film that employs neither repeated shock tactics nor blood and gore as a means to horrify the viewer. The fate befalling Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu's victims is indeed disturbing for many, but to describe SPOORLOOS merely as a "twist ending" film doesn't do it justice. The true horror of the movie lies within its studied, almost clinical exploration of sociopathic behaviour. For me Donnadieu's character, Raymond, is truly terrifying precisely because he DOESN'T appear evil or threatening, yet commits acts of extreme evil simply because he can find no reason not to. How many serial killers have we seen who, like Raymond, have apparently also been loving family men and hard-working members of society? Raymond could be the nice man living down the street from any one of us. SPOORLOOS is also about love and obsession and the torment of ignorance - Rex's behaviour, however irrational in the cold light of day, is down to the fact that he can no longer stand not knowing what happened to the woman he loved. Although a subtitled Dutch film with no stars and no knives is probably not everyone's idea of the perfect horror movie, if you like to think while you're being scared, SPOORLOOS is very much recommended. And no, don't see the exceedingly stupid Hollywood remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" is a thriller that is completely devoid of blood, gore or cheap shocks, and if one looks close enough, they'll also happen to notice that it doesn't contain any actual VIOLENCE either. But it is also scary as hell. Directed by George Sluizer, this foreign effort was completed in 1988, but never found a North American release until 1991 because it was feared that our audiences would never be to able handle the film's relentlessly grim and nihilistic tone. Indeed, Sluizer tried to gain more exposure for this highly acclaimed piece of work by directing a remake of it in 1993, but the film was a cliched, Hollywoodized disaster that angered fans of the original by changing its ending - which was one of the most shocking ever put into a movie. But while this grave artistic mistake effectively put an end to Sluizer's promising career, the bright side of it all is that it only upped the realization that the original "Vanishing" was one-of-a-kind masterpiece. All traditional genre cliches are chucked right out the window in this film. The story involves a Dutchman named Rex, who goes on vacation in France with his girlfriend, Saskia. The opening scenes establish how happy this couple is, but things suddenly take a turn for the worst, when they stop off at a gas station and Saskia disappears. We soon come to realize how big a nightmare a situation like this can be as Rex searches around for her in panic, and learns the horrifying news that she was seen leaving with another man. Three years pass by and Rex is still searching for her. His obsession takes over his life and sidetracks his relationship with another woman. During the opening scenes, we catch a brief glimpse of Raymond Lemorne, the man responsible for Saskia's disappearance, and soon after, the story switches to his perspective. It is here that "The Vanishing" establishes itself as a thriller that will be unlike all the rest, as Lemorne is presented as one of the most frightening but complex villains ever put on film. A successful and seemingly ordinary teacher with a loving wife and two daughters, his villainous actions is only provoked by that the fact that there is, quite simply, nothing that can technically stop him from doing so. He is very smart, but not exactly perfect at what he does. There are scenes in this movie that manage to be both funny and chilling at the same time as Lemorne practices his kidnapping routine, and then pathetically tries to lure young women into his car without any success. His scheme fails many times until he meets Saskia.This may sound like pretty nihilistic stuff, but as stated in the opening paragraph, it is all done with a complete absence of violence and gore. Much of "The Vanishing"'s impact is produced from what we imagine rather than what we can see. The film may not seem that suspenseful at first glance, but the tension builds up so subtly that by the time the film is over, one is surprised at how drained they actually are. Sluizer's storytelling genius stems from the fact that the audience is so anxious to find out what happened to Saskia, yet when the truth finally arrives, we are almost wishing he hadn't told us. Even Rex, who has had his life completely taken over by his obsession about Saskia's fate, ends up realizing that he would have been better off not knowing either. I will not go into the specifics about the ending of the film, only to say that it is one of the most shocking you will ever see - and therefore, one of the best. Unlike most twist endings, it manages to pull off the supremely difficult feat of seeming both surprising and inevitable at the same time. Even if you can't stand the concept of subtitles, all fans of the thriller genre are urged to check the original "Vanishing" out at all costs. It will make you think twice before ever making contact with a stranger again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains spoilers for this movie as well as the American remake The Vanishing*Ever since I first saw the American remake, The Vanishing, more than ten years ago, I have wanted to watch Spoorloos because I've heard that it's a lot better than the American movie. I've never been able to find it at any rental stores though, but just last week it was released on DVD here in Sweden and naturally I had to see it as soon as possible.First things first, Spoorloos is indeed a much better movie than The Vanishing. Everything from acting to execution. The fact that the great ending in Spoorloos is changed into some typical "let's kill the psycho"-ending in the American version is absolutely laughable. I sat watching this movie fearing that ending here as well, but luckily it didn't happen.Spoorloos is a great drama about a sociopathic killer and his victims. I can't say I would ever think of this movie as a thriller because it is not suspenseful in the way I expect thrillers to be suspenseful. Now, that doesn't mean I like this movie less, in fact I probably like it more because it doesn't go the usual thriller route with the premise. Just as with the American remake, it could easily have gone to those extremes. I like it much better this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serial killer not like the other ones...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raymond Lemorne gives the image of a model man. He lives in the south of France in a country house, he's married and has two children. He's also a chemistry teacher. In short, he's a respectable and respectful man. But, he leads a double life. He's also a serial-killer who lures women into a trap to kill them. Why does he do this? We will learn his secret which gives a cold back at the end of the film.It's true. We already saw this type of character a thousand times in the cinema but "Spoorloos" retains the attention because, here Lemorne's motive matters the most. It's a suspenseful and original movie in the way we know the name of Siskia's killer, well before Rex and virtually from the beginning of the movie but we've got to know his motive. In this flick, the murderer doesn't kill for sadistic pleasure or because he suffers from mental trouble but under metaphysical believes. Lemorne doesn't trust in determination and wishes to determine precisely the frontier between good and evil inside him. The title of the film in French was translated by "l'homme qui voulait savoir" (the man who wanted to know). This title was well chosen because it is relevant with the topic of the movie. It has a double meaning: 2 men want to know something. On the one hand, Rex who investigates about his girlfriend Saskia's vanishing and on the other hand, Lemorne who tries to discover where evil has its limits according to him. It is thanks to this new variation on the serial killer movie that "Spoorloos" draws a big authenticity and it surely explains why Hollywood was interested by making a remake of it several years later.But "Spoorloos" has plenty other qualities which deserve to be enumerated. The director George Sluizier opts for sobriety and simplicity with eventually limited means. He avoids as much as possible spectacular effects and there are nearly no special effects or violent sequences. Lemorne's strange habits arise the spectator's curiosity and Sluizier proceeds by little touches to describe his main character's wrongdoings. He also has the developed sense of detail. Throughout the film, we often see unusual objects which we will learn their real function at the end of the film. Sluizier also succeeds in imposing mystery and anxiety in apparently calm and peaceful Mediterranean landscapes.Bernard Pierre Donnadieu's imposing composition (a great and underrated French actor) in an unexpected role he takes with consummate skill should convince you to watch this film. But it would be unfair to neglect the two other main actors (Gene Bervoets and Johanna Ter Steeze) who also show talent.With "Spoorloos", Dutch cinema has given us a true gem and concerning the remake, I didn't watch it but the odds are that it must be inferior to the first version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the original version of "The Vanishing," with the American re-make coming out six years later than this film did.This version - the original - is considered to be, by far, the better of the two by almost all critics. Having seen both versions, I agree but not as strongly because I don't think this film is all that good, either, at least not as good as I was led to believe.Instead of a kidnapping-crime story, this was more of a character study of two people: a man obsessed with finding his abducted girlfriend, and a deranged killer, the man who took her. That "study" made this different from the other film and from a lot of crime movies to begin with. The ending here also made this a bit different.Summary: it's okay, but not anywhere as good as you might be led to believe, but I would still recommend it. I saw it twice.</fullReview>

This story takes some very dark roads, very dark. With an ending that is so surprising, so original, yet so simple and easy. Its easily one of the best films I have seen in a very, very long time. No wonder why Stanley Kubrick thought The Vanishing was the most terrifying film he had ever seen. Watching this film equals three years in film school. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dutch director George Sluizer (1932-2014) would be remembered for a very long time for having directed this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dutch film "The Vanishing" (Spoorloos) was released quietly in 1988 but its popularity has grown exponentially over the years. Its impact on mainstream cinema especially Hollywood has been tremendous as its director George Sluizer got a chance to direct American version of this film with established actors Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland. The reasons for liking "The Vanishing" could be many but anybody who has seen it would agree that it makes its way to viewers' hearts and minds as it portrays a highly intelligent criminal who keeps everybody guessing about his real motives. George Sluizer was able to extract excellent performances from all his leading actors especially from Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu who is truly unbelievable due to his profile of a 'common man' who bumps into most of us on a daily basis. 'Spoorloos' is recommended for those viewers who tend to forget their watches when they see an intelligent story unroll on screen. As there is no match for an original product, 'The Vanishing' continues to enjoy a new lease of life partially due to its discovery by new admirers of thriller cinema due to its release on DVD by Criterion collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly not the most spell-bindingly entertaining film I've seen this month/year, but still a remarkable piece of work nonetheless.In fact it seems rather out-of-date at times, as well as being a dreaded 'foreign language' film with subtitles, and positively meandering in places, so what's the attraction? Fabulous character development and a sinister story.If you've already seen the film then you'll remember it as a pretty straightforward plot with a couple of major questions, what happened to Saskia and will Rex find out?However, what makes this film thought provoking is the character development. Or rather, the non-development of the sub-characters. I questioned the Director's choice of cast at the end of the film - the boring, rather unattractive wife; the dull, rather obedient future girlfriend; the unstated nature of the entire film, until I realised that that's the point - an intelligently directed film which makes you ponder the previous events after its conclusion and delve deeper into the curious personalities of the equally unstable male protagonists.I suppose you could classify 'Spoorloos' as a mild thriller on first viewing, but gradually ramp that opinion up to unnerving horror over time. A rare film that I'll no doubt watch again just to re-analyse my initial understated judgement of the main characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scares of Normalcy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoorloos is an unusually horrifying film that doesn't dwell on sudden scares or supernatural underpinnings. It is about the romantic relationship two lovers share, and how anything can happen to any person at a whim. One of humans' greatest accomplishments is the drive to seek knowledge. Our curiosity has led to modern advancements, but it sometimes takes us too far. We call those whom do immeasurable good "saints" in our culture, but what about those whom complete both the greatest good and the greatest evil? The most unsettling factoid is that this person may be praised, well-known or even camouflaged within society. Defying normalcy, even in a world of billions, is not common. It's when we oppose traditions and order that we discover freedom. What happens afterwards, though, is inconceivable to the casual man. It's the unknown that we strive to know, yet it is also something we must fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your traditional thriller, and completely engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" is a fantastic thriller, but in a very different way than most thrillers. It is about knowledge - about what the characters know about the disappearance, and what they know about themselves. It skillfully navigates through several genres--with elements of classic thrillers, psychological horror, and mystery. What really impressed me, however, was how accessible it is. Even viewers who would not normally be drawn to contemporary European cinema will be captivated. Director George Sluizer unfolds his story with unnerving precision. Cutting back and forth in time, he traces the paths taken by the three main characters, as if running an omniscient finger along the lines of a fatalistic road map.The emotional apprehension runs high from the very beginning. We know that Saskia is going to vanish, but Sluizer toys with us for a while, constantly reminding us that it is coming. Things get slightly stranger once we are introduced to Raymond, but the question of what happened to Saskia and whether or not she is his only victim is constantly present. The husband has advertised all over France and Holland for his wife. He can think of nothing else - even though he is in a new relationship, with a woman who tries to understand the obsession. The abductor, of course, has seen the advertisements. He is not without sympathy for this man. And so the final scenes unfold.What makes this film so appealing to a broad audience is the way that it connects to things that are universal. Like all great horror, the suspense in "The Vanishing" comes from fears to which we can all relate: the sudden and unexpected disappearance of a loved one, and the disorientation that comes from being a stranger in a new place, unable to find anyone to help. These anxieties quickly heightens powerful emotions, and draws viewers into the film immediately. Piecing together when all of this happens takes most of the film to accomplish, and it represents an important part of the mystery. The timing of the events becomes clear in the same horrible way that the events themselves do, all unfolding as things progress towards the now-famous conclusion, in which everything becomes suddenly and disturbingly clear. This process never feels manufactured or arbitrary, and, once again, deepens the viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this film, on TV, in the early 90s - not long after it came out. I was shocked by it more than by pretty much any other film I have seen. The ending haunted me. And haunted me. It was deeply disturbingBut surely once you know the dénouement it would spoil the film, if you saw it again? Er... no. Not at all.Recently I managed to get the DVD (for some reason I have never seen it on TV again) and knowing the end makes no difference. If anything it enhances what comes before.Because what comes before is cinematic, directorial brilliance. It may seem slow but it grips like a vice because the horror is SO real, SO everyday, SO could-have-happened-to-you. Because we have all stopped on a motorway while a loved one goes to the toilet... and a few minutes later you start to think that they have taken just a bit too long to return. Or is that because I have seen this film?The only "problem", in a way, is that the ending is so overwhelming that you forget all this on first viewing. On second or third you see the sheer brilliance, and it grips you all the more - the sheer inevitability of what is to come.I babble. Just watch the film, and then ask yourself if you have ever been more disturbed by two hours of cinematography.</fullReview>

When his lady vanishes, Gene Bervoets (as Rex) tries to retrace her steps. She is remembered as having possibly been speaking with another man. There are scant clues, and authorities are unable to solve the case. Three years later, suspiciously psycho but good citizen Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu (as Raymond Lemorne) approaches Mr. Bervoets with the promise of leading him to the missing Johanna ter Steege (as Saskia). there's a catch, however - Bervoets must agree to Mr. Donnadieu's unorthodox rules for the journey...The vanishing person plot always forms the basis for a good movie, if the director and performers keep you interested; and, in this film, they certainly succeed. Rest assured, you will be rewarded by learning exactly what happened to the missing woman. It may not be what you're expecting, which is fine. But there are some head-scratching decisions along the way. Probably, we're supposed to go along with the story thread that begins when Ms. Steege tells Bervoets about her "Golden Egg" dream, which could even be argued as making the ending unexpectedly happy, and Donnadieu a do-gooder through and through. It provokes thought...******** Spoorloos (8/29/88) George Sluizer ~ Gene Bervoets, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, Johanna ter Steege, Gwen Eckhaus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that haunted me in the night. The main quality of the story in its entirety is the main fear of many people to lose your girlfriend all of a sudden. This often happens in our real life, but the kidnapping of Spoorloos is imaginable in reality, but hardly ever happens in such a gruesome way. Saskia has such an innocent, reliable, devoted personality that she is one of the most unexpected random victims of Raymond the sociopath. She didn't expect her dream of the golden egg to realize by being buried alive by anyone she has just met on a petrol station. The way she felt while wakening in a coffin after the anaesthesias must be a multiple paramount of her most awful dreams.Despite the abundant gruesome scenes, this movie has moved me in a positive sense: on her own request, Rex had promised Saskia to never leave her alone again. Even after her vanishing, he went beyond all his borders to figure out what had happened to her by consciously taking the risk of being assassinated himself too. I think that hardly any boyfriend would emphasize his promised unconditional loyalty in such an eternal way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most chilling films in recent memory will likely send a shiver down even the most fearless spine, using not the easy shock of sudden scare tactics, but a more effective sense of accumulating dread. It begins not unlike a routine whodunit, when a Dutch couple's road trip abruptly ends after the young wife disappears, seemingly into thin air, and the bewildered husband begins an obsessive search for clues to what he believes (correctly, as it turns out) was a kidnapping. Parallel flashbacks reveal the methods and motivation of the man responsible (a memorable villain because he behaves so unlike a psychopath: he could be anyone at all), gradually revealing not just how and why he abducted a total stranger, but what his ultimate crime really was: the stuff nightmares are made of. The film is simple, elegant, and indelible, and unlike a lot of movies absolutely must be seen in a darkened theater for the proper claustrophobic impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unsettling probably isn't the best word but hey. I wouldn't quite call it disturbing (although it kind of is) but it definitely leaves you with some dark thoughts/questions to ponder. When was it predetermined I would/wouldn't do this/that? A central question. What's real freedom or consciousness or something. Resonates a lot with me. It seems like most people are willing to accept the narrow range of choices that modern television (for example) promotes for us (the big question is what are you gonna buy not what you're gonna do with your life or what your values are). Yeah, I've some "society issues". They're all zombies and I'm the only normal one. Trapped.But it's especially interesting in regards to the concept of evil. Doing something because you can. Maybe the idea is things get pretty scary when you have no morals. Does the distinction between good and evil take away from our freedom? I'd say no but man was this movie fascinating. It's like the idea of kids wanting to do things simply because they are prohibited. Even if you wouldn't do it usually, you become attracted because you feel like you ought to have the right to (or like the excitement of a risk). Or out of boredom. That's a big one. Want less graffiti? Give them another outlet. Tougher laws will only bring more trouble. Same with smoking and speeding. Kids need inspiration, not scare-tactics. What *should* they do? What *is* so great about life anyway?The whole film had a weird atmosphere to it. You never feel completely comfortable but it's intriguing. The characters are unpredictable but in a way that has an oddly familiar logic to it. Can't describe it, that's why I'm struggling... The impact by the end is pretty powerful. So, how is all this achieved then? Well, it's hard to say. I just feel like the creators hit upon an interesting idea and captured its mood perfectly. I find when trying to compose (or act, not that I can do either), it always helps if the emotion(s) come first. You have a real feeling and it naturally comes through in the music/performance and without you necessarily understanding the rationale/logic of the translation - just like in real life, it's just what we're born to do. Except these days, there seem to be all these rules about how you deal with emotions which messes up the natural connections. Whatever.The performances were really good. Very human characters. Flawed but always searching and doing things. I also liked the obvious bit of symbolism with the coins and eggs. It's nice when a movie works on multiple levels. Too many movies may have great artistic quality or beauty but while being very difficult to decipher. Spoorloos is still open to interpretation but at least on the surface, it's clear what the central ideas/themes are. Even if you don't appreciate its more subtle qualities, you get a strong sense of its intended purpose and mood.It's a great thriller different from what you've seen before that isn't afraid to raise some difficult and strange questions. The point is it gives them weight as unsolved mysteries of human life rather than trying to explain them. Few films have that kind of patience and of course, it pays off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: spoilers. I prefer the original because I think the story is really about obsession. Raymond and Rex share this quality and the ending of the original speaks to this obsession. Rex meets his end out of his complete and utter obsession with finding out what happened to Saskia. Raymond's meticulous pursuit of murder results from a philosophical obsession. With the remake, Keifer selling the story rights to Hollywood is fitting for the films mundane ending, not to mention the perfect metaphor for a sell-out ending. To me, Rex in the box, flicking his lighter and screaming for Saskia is a truly frightening moment. It's classic horror with no blood, guts or severed limbs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised on reading the comments listed here - there is a general lack of the negative reviews which tend to appear whenever a film forces the viewer to think.So, without wanting to labour a point made here on several occasions already -DO NOT WATCH THE HOLLYWOOD VERSIONThe power of this film - which is completely ignored in the remake - is in the fact that the killer is such a normal family man. Granted, he has some serious 'issues' that need resolving(!), but to all intents and purposes, he is an everyday man.A man who abducts and kills people in a quite bone-chilling way.And what sets this apart from the usual Hollywood serial killer hokum (aside of the exceptionally dark and frightening ending) is that it tells us a horrible truth - that evil is merely the absence of good.Now that is scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS INCLUDED!The best film I've seen so far at least. It has the aura of Hitchcock films and just like them it keeps your blood pressure high throughout. If you feel thirsty while watching, you simply won't get up to get a glass of water. Instead you'll wait until the end of the film. Keeps you attached to the screen and affects your breathing for sure. SPOILERS *** The only flaw I can think of about this film is that, the amount of exaggeration goes over the limit at times, especially when Rex aims to end his curiosity at the possible cost of ending his life. And his physical crisis while with Lieneke doesn't look very realistic. One downside of this film compared to Hitchcock films is that, the guilty one is more or less manifested unlike Hitchcock films. Nothing is revealed obviously, but I still found it disturbing that they showed the bad guy instead of giving alternatives to the viewer. *** END OF SPOILERSApart from what I mentioned in the spoilers, I think it's an awesome film that everyone should see. Now I'm curious to see the American version after this one. I have a feeling they would have "raped" the soul of the film, but still, even a bad copy of this film would be worth watching. I recommend Spoorloos to anyone of any culture, any gender and any age, except for those with heart conditions :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you HANDLE "the truth?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have never needed movies to tell us about the unpredictable and unexplainable nature of evil. There is no single film that will ever top the absolute, mind-bending horror that was 9/11, as it played out in stark living color on TV screens throughout the world. That said, in a world where we now have anthrax attacks, armed guards checking baggage at airports and snipers killing people at random, if you're already paranoid enough, you may want to skip this movie. If you want to know why bad things happen to good people and if there is some kind of spiritual or galactic balance to temper it, you may STILL not want to see this movie.If you're still curious, though, and just have to find out what it is about the original VANISHING that has people freaking out even now, then have at it, and make a wide detour around the big-budget, Hollywood-ized remake. (If you're like me, you won't have a problem with that, since once is all I needed for viewing this one.)For all the classic shock endings of every suspense/horror thriller that's ever been raved about, this ranks right up there with THE WICKER MAN, and even manages to put THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT to shame. Just...don't expect to get a whole lot of sleep afterwards.Rex and Saskia are a couple on holiday, and they have one of those fights that couples sometimes do. They haven't quite made up when they stop at a gas station for a break, but things look at least promising, when Saskia goes into the station's store for drinks...and never returns. Rex waits and waits, but to no avail. She has vanished without a trace, and knowing the fight they were having wasn't THAT bad, Rex can only assume the worst.But, years later, even when he has someone new in his life, Rex cannot drop the quest or the question: whatever happened to Saskia? Then he meets a man who could know the answer, and hints that he does know, but just like curiosity and the cat, there is a price for knowledge. And the bill here is too terrifyingly expensive for anyone to have to pay...I saw this back in 1990, and the ending has still stuck with me all these years gone by. There have been films with endings that come pretty close to being this nihilistic and desperately bleak, (SEVEN comes to mind, as does the classic SECONDS, the aforementioned WICKER MAN, and the presciently apocalyptic NATURAL BORN KILLERS.) But this is the one to which all must be compared, and where I have seen most of those other films more than once, just because of the climax alone, I have no desire to view this one again.If you will not be deterred by this review, read the opening summary again and remember: I told you so...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are the scary movies that grab you with lots of gothic bumps-in-the-night, and there are the very few that sneak up behind you. "Spoorloos" (aka "The Vanishing") is one of the latter. At some point during the film I realized that I couldn't pull away - even when the events were getting deadly serious, and I wanted to. I haven't used the word "foreboding" since English class in high school, but it certainly applies to this film. Beautifully directed, with not a shot wasted, and the acting is great. I haven't seen the American version - but why bother? However, if you're looking for a good popcorn thriller, or you're alone watching it and you're sensitive, this may not be the movie for you. The ending is terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Sluizer, the director, gives a lesson on the boundlessness of hope, desire to know the truth, and on the question whether it is scarier to know or not to know. This movie has no (read as: does not need) fancy effects nor a tricky plot. It is a display of brilliant story-telling and well sized, plausible characters.Yes, watch the movie. But be warned: You will have to pay. It is thrilling (off the scale). It will change your mind. You will never forget it.Personally I think, it was worth that bit of sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rex Hoffman's obsessional quest to discover what happened to his abducted girlfriend Saskia is at the centre of what I think is one of the most remarkable films ever made. Please don't allow yourself to be put off by the fact that this movie is subtitled, after the first ten minutes you'll be so gripped you won't care.One of the many impressive aspects of the film is its structure; although Saskia disappears early on we dont see exactly what fate befell her until the end, so when her abduction is played out in its entirety we watch it with a real sense of dread.Aswell as being an excellent study of the lengths a person will go to in unravelling the truth, it's also contains, in Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu's brilliant performance, a chilling depiction of a remorseless sociopath.On the surface he may appear to be a gentle family man, but this is simply his "mask of sanity", and the film perfectly illustrates how crimes of this nature can be so horribly random; Saskia is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.I won't spoil the ending,but I think it's fair to say you'll be staring at the screen in true shock, which is all the more remarkable considering there's no bloodshed. All in all this is one of the eeriest and darkest movies you'll ever see. Oh and one final thing:we're always hearing about defining images in cinema like John Wayne's departure in the ridiculously over-rated Searchers and the infamous shower scene in Psycho, but in my opinion they pale in comparison to the shot of Donnadieu staking out his victim, with Saskia's image reflected</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pleasant discovery of a very fine dutch film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie in DVD and I liked it. I am very glad I did not read any of the user comments in the IMDB before I watched it: quite a few reviews by Americans are quite unfair and biased not that I disagree some comments by Europeans are exaggerated.It is not the ending that makes this 1988 Dutch film good. By the end of year 2001 we are so much used to Hollywood movies of 'shocking' endings (and all the unplesant tricks to 'shock' the audiences.) Now, think about this film. Is there any single scene that shows you a character painted with blood, or gross creatures or ghosts, or 'human-eating', or disgusting orchestral sounds that alarm the audience that something's going to happen, or...?? Nothing. Yet, until the end, you keep asking the same question that Rex asks to himself and to Raymond: "What happened to Saskia?", and if you ask "Why?" this film has more than enough to let yourself see the darkness of our human nature (or evil). I was not that surprised by the ending either but that is not really the point here. Nor that means the story is predictable. (I wonder what Americans mean by 'predictable'.) If you were disappointed by the film, probably you simply did not understand the film and it is not the fault of this film. Considering all the factors (acting, in particular) I'd give it 8.5/10 and I believe it is more honest and fair than 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old people, intellectuals and wimps (and I identify with two of those three classifications) seem to like to talk about how subtlety is a lost art in the horror/suspense genre; replaced by cheap thrills, gore and gloss. It seems a bit old fashioned and cliched, but then again, how many horror classics actually DO contain copious depictions of disembowellings, decapitations, buckets of blood, etc, etc? I can think of maybe 4 or 5 (and the living dead trilogy makes up three of them), and none of those can even begin to rival the unsettling effect that Spoorloos had on me. True, it's hardly tailor made for American mass consumption (after all it's made be crazy foreigners who talk in funny languages, and us yanks find that stuff a little highbrow for our tastes) hence the remake, but anyone with a little bit of patience and an IQ over 65 should find this movie more than a little upsetting. Beats the pants off of any of the trash Hollywood constantly assaults us with on a daily basis. Not to sound TOO pretentious or anything...</fullReview>

If you don't wanna think during a movie go see 'Scream' or something. If you don't mind thinking this is a great movie. I especially recommend it to people who are interested in psychology (you will recognize a lot). For people who don't like the ending I recommend reading the book (a Dutch classic).

		<shortDescription>Traceless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoorloos (AKA: The Vanishing) is directed by George Sluizer and Sluizer co-adapts the screenplay with Tim Krabbe from Krabbe's own novella The Golden Egg. It stars Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, Gene Bervoets, Johanna ter Steege and Gwen Eckhaius. Music is by Hennie Vrienten and cinematography by Toni Kuhn.It's a lesson in creeping unease, a film firmly interested in character development as it unfurls a tale of obsession whilst casting a clinical observation of a sociopath at work. Story is basic on plot terms, young lovers are separated during a vacation when the girl mysteriously disappears. So begins her boyfriend's obsessive search that spans years, then things get intriguing as the person responsible for girls disappearance starts sending the boyfriend messages, giving him the run around, until the question is asked. Just how far are you prepared to go to find out what happened?The script is brutally clever, we follow two parallel lives, that of emotionally torn boyfriend Rex Hoffman (Bervoets), and that of sociopath Raymond Lemorne (Donnadieu), the latter of which is a family man moving freely amongst his loved ones whilst simultaneously practising his perfect crime. Lemorne is a very different type of sociopath to what normally fills out horror movies, he's sometimes a figure of fun, even inept, but he beats a black heart and as Rex Hoffman is going to find out, he's very methodical in his belief that he was destined to enact a perfect crime.Sluizer builds the picture very slowly, only turning the screw an inch at a time. He lets Spoorloos chill our blood not by jolt shocks or stalk and slash histrionics, but by the very fact that Raymond does what he does just because he can. While the disintegration of Rex's emotional being is terrifying in its realism, what gnaws away at him also gnaws away the audience, so when the coup de grace comes at film's end, the impact is like being run over by a tank. Great direction is matched by great acting from the principal players, to seal the deal for Spoorloos being a truly excellent thriller that's well worth seeking out by those after a bit more thought in their thriller viewings. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i started watching this movie i wasn't very enthusiastic about the scenario, i was just searching for a good thriller to see depended on iambs' ratings.This movie shocked me and i am talking seriously it was something so much different and mad that led my mind to complete heat.It wasn't the facts so much but the psychological background of 'the man' that 'descended' you so much and the gap in which this movie leads you which could be yours is so terrifying and revealing.'The curiosity killed the cat' as they say in Greece.The truth is that the movie plays with something so deep....the needing to know.....or with other words.... the curiosity of the man which can ascend somebody so much but can also destroy a life. Could somebody carry the burden of not knowing what happened to somebody he used to love taking for granted that he will never see him/her again. And the most tremendous and disturbing everything happened all of a sudden....this could absolutely turn somebody mad.....but to understand what i am saying you have to see it, however even then i am not sure that you will be affected the same way with me but it's worth seeing a movie with a deep 'noema' and something to say . I suggest you seeing it alone because then it will affect your thoughts and feelings more without any disturbances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE VANISHING (Georges Sluizer - Netherlands/France 1988).We first meet a young Dutch couple, Rex Hofman and Saskia Wagter (Gene Bervoets and Johanna ter Steege), traveling to their holiday destination in France. During a stop at a gas station along the freeway she disappears. He frantically tries to report her missing, but no one takes him seriously. The trail of clues quickly turns cold and he gets obsessed by her disappearance and must know what happened. Soon after, the culprit is introduced. His name is Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a father of two children who teaches chemistry at a high-school in his hometown. He is a sociopath and his beneficiary appearance makes his acts seem even more monstrous. So the film is not about who did it, but how this man came to commit such a crime like this. Successful Dutch thrillers are rare, but "Spoorloos", based on the book "The Golden Egg" by Tim Krabbé, manages to sustain an unpleasant tension right till its horrific finale. The film is without any spectacular effects, it's sober with practically no violence on screen, effectively building up an uneasy tension right from the beginning, doing a much more effective job than many better-known films of its kind. The most interesting thing about the film is the structuring, with the story switching back and forward between Rex continuous search for Saskia and Raymond Lemorne's family life and his careful preparations, preceding Saskia's abduction. Having read the book and having seen the film a number of times, the ending is - naturally - not as disturbing as upon first viewing, but if you've never seen this, it will no doubt come of as one of the most shocking endings you'll ever see.Sluizer did a good job in adapting the script together with Tim Krabbé, but his directorial skills are limited. It's the unusual story that makes it work together with strong performances throughout. The typically late eighties keyboard electronic score by Henny Vrienten, who contributed the score for something like half of all Dutch films since 1985, is a bit of a letdown, much too standard. Sluizer also directed a ludicrous American remake in 1993, changing the ending and thereby the entire essence of the film. Forget about that one. This is the one to see.Camera Obscura --- 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is genuinely one of the most exquisitely plotted thrillers that I have ever seen. The odd, shifting structure is ingenious and the movies main themes of panic, loss and obsession brilliantly highlight the bland ordinariness of pure evil and the heartbreaking quest of the main character to find the truth above all costs. Proceedings move along with a riveting pace from the everydayness of the movies opening towards the inevitable dread of its closing few scenes. All of the performances bar none are flawless and the two main actors should be highly praised. The much vaunted ending is especially chilling and will stay with you for a long, long time after the film has stopped rolling. A word of warning though, steer clear of the Hollywood remake starring Kiefer Sutherland and Jeff Bridges (and curiously directed again by George Sluizer), which guts the memory of the masterful original by fumbling the ending on a monumental scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and philosophical Dutch psycho triller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very successful Dutch thriller starts with a Hitchcock-like shock, breaking into the all-day life of a joyful young couple. During a car trip through France, Rex's girlfriend Saskia takes a break at a motorway station and leaves to get something to drink in a shop. She never returns, and Rex starts a desperate search for her without a single sing of her life. After three years of investigations, an older French gentleman called Raymond appears and invites Rex for another car trip back to France - he proposes him the only chance in his life to find out what has really happened to Saskia three years ago...George Sluizer's "Spoorlos" is an outstanding modern psycho thriller who takes a completely different way than similar productions. The story develops very slowly without becoming boring or uninteresting at any time. There are no action scenes, no classic suspense shocks and no big showdown... only a shocking situation in the beginning of the story, a slowly-developing horror story which takes much time to reveal the past and the motivation of the killer, and another big and cruel shock at the end of the story.If you ever get the chance to watch this 1988 original version watch it, as Sluizer's own disappointing American remake "The Vanishing" in 1992, starring Nick Nolte, Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock, has a completely different standard ending and a typical action showdown plot which takes the creepy and silent horror atmosphere of the original completely away.</fullReview>

Forget Hollywood-productions like Scream, The Faculty or Silence or The Shining, those movies are just not that frightening as spoorloos is!And also forget the remake The Vanishing, even Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland couldn't make it into a good movie!

		<fullReview>I would urge any movie fans with a slight amount of intellect to ignore those who dismiss this movie as tedious. It is intelligent, well plotted, atmospheric. It is a classic film noir of the type it seems completely impossible for an american studio to make. The pace is designed to build expectation - the simple musical touches well judged, the acting and cinematography perfect for the task. The storyline will haunt and engross anybody with a little imagination. It is such a believable scenario with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. No-one uses a gun - no special effects - no holes in the plot. Every action is is explained and made believable by the intense obsessions of the two protagonists. An underrated gem that deserves more mainstream recognition. I haven't watched the US remake - there is no need. It would be a pointless and impossible task to improve on this. And yes - you can watch it as many times as you like and still enjoy the trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" was a hum-drum thriller in the US. When I read that not only was it a remake but that the original was recommended as a genuinely spooky film and had a different ending, I put it on my "find in any form" list. Blockbuster and the other typical places didn't have it but I finally tracked it down with Netflix. Since it's in French and Dutch, the close-captioning is in English. Obviously, it is not going to appeal to people who don't want to read captions (I have to have them anyway since I am hearing-impaired) and it's not going to attract folks who expect gore with scary films. But, wow! What a cumulative effect this movie has on you! It may seem tedious in a few spots but after it's over you realize that was essential to establishing some of the characters. This movie will resonate for quite a while after you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies don't come as gripping as The Vanishing. Not only is it a creepy, haunting thriller about a search for a lost loved one, but it is also a disturbing character study of a psychopath. The acting is superb, the screenplay brilliant, and the ending; well, they don't come as shocking as this one. The only complaint is that sometimes it's hard to tell what scenes are flashbacks. Apart from that, it's an absolutely brilliant thriller. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Rex drank the drugged coffee?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Spoilers ***Why Rex drank the drugged coffee?Rex must have felt that what happened to Saskia is partially his fault. After all, he left her alone and frightened in the dark tunnel, something for which he regretted when he realized how scared she was. Then he took an oath to not leave her ever again. An oath he couldn't keep even for a day, despite it wasn't really his fault.The point is, in my opinion, Rex was teared apart by guilt for 3 long years because he was feeling somewhat guilty. His remorse was clearly demonstrated by what he said to his new girlfriend Lineke: "If Saskia was alive I would choose you, but if I really have a choice, I would rather go back to that gas station three years ago to be with Saskia (paraphrasing)." Again, he remembers Saskia's dream about how lonely was she trapped in a golden egg, floating somewhere in the Neverland. Forever, until her egg collides with a second one. Three years later, Rex is still constantly thinking about what happened to Saskia, and the days preceding her disappearance. Now his life is completely ruined ? Lineke is about to leave him because everything Rex does, everywhere he goes the ghost of his former girlfriend haunts him; he is also probably deeply in debt and his career (and entire life) put on hold. Rex is already living in hell.Admittedly, his decision to drink the cup of drugged coffee is completely irrational. But then, again Rex's mind has already been broken by the time he and Raymond met. Do you remember how happy he looked with Saskia at the gas station? Probably the only other scene you will see him half smiling is when he discussed funny names with Raymond. Would you do that with the man who kidnapped and probably killed your girlfriend/wife? A sociopath and another person, who is aware of the sociopath's deeds, are bonding over stories told by the former, in fact, reveals how mentally damaged is the later individual as well.The final push to Rex's illogical step towards his very plausible demise came when he found the coins buried (a great deal of "Golden eggs" symbolism is included in the flick) during the very last moments he and Saskia had together 3 years ago. In the spur of the moment, overwhelmed by the memory, guilt, and, of course, his obsession "To Know," and unable to think rational anymore, he does the unthinkable ? he drinks the cup just like a suicide would ingest a poisonous drink. The analogy with a suicidal person is appropriate, I think, because they also do stupid things, which might seem illogical to every other person in the right state of mind. He drank to drown his sorrows.Lastly, let's go back to the point of Rex feeling remorse about leaving Saskia alone?again, and his oath. Knowing that his fate is most likely sealed (no pun intended) if he proceeds to take the killer's bitter drink, Rex commits something similar to suicide. A part of him feels he deserves what is going to happen to him ? the same thing happened to Saskia. But in his mind might seem more like a sacrifice. Rex finally embraces his fate. His desire is "To Know" and to reunite with Saskia somewhere as both being golden eggs, floating together until they collide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life as a nihilistic nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proved unforgettable when I saw it upon its release in 1988. I saw it again this week and it remains just as thought-provoking and even more psychologically interesting.Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnedieu) is an unlikely criminal -- a clean-cut and seemingly conventional family man. No one would predict his destiny would intersect with that of a couple of tourists from the Netherlands -- Rex (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia (Johanna ter Steege).But their paths do happen to cross at a sunny, busy truck stop near Nimes. And all because of a sneeze, the Dutch couple ends up dead -- Saskia within what may have been a short period of time and Rex some three years later.This grim depiction of the insane unpredictability of life was shocking the first time I saw it and seemed all the more devastating on a re-viewing.We begin with closeups of an unpleasant insect -- the walking stick that blends so amazingly into its environment. Most people wouldn't even know it is there -- just like Lemorne and his hum-drum life. We end with a view of a praying mantis, that exponentially more threatening creature that appears prayerful but is an implacable predator.The performances here are uniformly strong. Rex reveals himself to be a rash and faithless companion in the film's early frames, as he recklessly allows the couple's car to run out of gas in a tunnel. What kind of guy commits that kind of blunder and leaves his girlfriend to fend for herself in the dark? Saskia comes across at first as a sensible person -- the type who keeps her eyes on the gas gauge and packs a flashlight. After Rex's unforgivable abandonment she's upset for a while -- she seems on the verge of tears and almost flippantly gets Rex to swear he will never leave her alone again.Rex's apology seems to assuage Saskia's ire and even leave her giddy and hypomanic -- to the point that she blithely asks the clearly odd Lemorne if she can buy a key chain he is holding that bears her lover's initial. The caution she had demonstrated to Rex is nowhere to be seen as she giddily exchanges French with Lemorne, accompanies him to his car, and fatefully takes a seat beside him.Like a human mantis, Lemorne attacks with precision and without mercy. It's a matter of time before the predator sets a different kind of a trap for Rex.Why does Rex drink the coffee? Has he been driven mad by guilt and a suicidal need to know? We're left to wonder.Just as our world crawls with spiders and mantids ply our yards, the Lemornes of the world are out there...lying in wait. This epic film offers a devastating warning never to trust! It is truly indelible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, i first watched this film back in the early 90's. I'd heard some good things about it but not an awful lot if truth be known and so i went into it blind essentially, knowing only the basic concept. What i then witnessed was one of the most traumatic viewing experiences of my life. It centres on a touring Dutch couple in France who stop at a Motorway Services to fill up fuel for their car and themselves. They become separated as she heads off to buy some drinks and after some time fails to return, causing her Boyfriend to begin a frantic hunt for her. Our Antagonist has a fantasy of abducting a woman, we see him rehearsing his routine using Chloroform and after a failed attempt, then decides to fake an injury, utilising a sling on his arm. You can guess what now happened to our Dutch Tourist. From here the film then concentrates on the Boyfriend attempting to track down his now long lost Girlfriend. News coverage brings our Antagonist back to the fore as he tracks down the Boyfriend, who has now found himself another Girl but is obviously still traumatised by the loss. He is promised he will find out what became of her if he goes on a trip with the Antagonist and this could very well turn out to be the worst decision of his life. The tension, this film builds is incredible, the acting is immense, direction, camera work...everything about this film is fantastic. The mystery surrounding what has happened to the Girlfriend builds throughout. There's one scene which when the final reveal is exposed suddenly hits you between the eyes, yet at the time ( for me on the first viewing) seemed almost irrelevant. It was one the very few films i've seen which literally had me on the edge of my seat and by the end, i was breathless and panicked. An incredible piece of film making.As a side note. Please, avoid the US remake with Kiefer Sutherland, Geoff Bridges and Sandra Bullock. It has none of the tension, suspense or mystery of the original and to be honest, it's almost unbelievable it was made by the same guy George Sluizer.</fullReview>

It's not really a mystery because the killer is revealed quite early on. What it does is it shakes the viewer to the core. Raymond is unrelenting.

		<shortDescription>The Vanishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: Don't read any reviews before watching this movie. It's best to go into this one completely blind.)When a couple goes on a seemingly innocent trip, the woman in the relationship seemingly vanishes after they take a short stop at a gas station. And now we have The Vanishing, one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time.The most interesting thing about this film is how it gains it's suspense. It's not through not knowing who the murderer is or not knowing when or who he'll strike next, it's gained through the idea that we don't know how and why the murderer did it. The murderer is revealed quite early in the movie, and he generally seems like a normal guy. He has a wife and kids and friends, one of which who laughs at the thought of him being a murderer. The film suggests that anyone we know could be a murderer and we may not know it.The main character of the film, the man in the relationship, has been looking for his former girlfriend for 3 years and even though he no longer believes she is alive, he is still obsessed with finding out what exactly happened to her, some would say out of pure curiosity and some would say because of fate. When everyone else (including the police) has given up searching for answers, he continues, and eventually he finds them. And where it brings him eventually is possibly because it simply was supposed to happen that way. The same reason that this happened in the first place, out of pure fate. And in a world where the murderer will probably get away and no one will ever know it was him, maybe they deserve to be together, somewhere off in another world, escaping from their golden eggs...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay maybe I was late to the party on this one, but I think this film is near perfect. In some ways it's feeling dated and the style looks simplistic at times (ie no flashy camera moves) but the shape of the story is fantastic, the camera-work is efficient and atmospheric and we get exactly the right ending....we get the ending that solves the films question. I have not yet seen the American one and don't care to, I can only imagine what they've done to the ending. The thing that's mostly great about this film is that the subjectivity of the story is shared with the antagonist which brilliantly adds to the mystery and depth of our interest in what happened.

		<fullReview>I read the synopsis, saw the description of the ending, and had to get a hold of this movie. Once I did, the slow pace of the beginning threw me off - brilliant - but the director then started unraveling things very slowly, each scene perfectly segues to the next. The flashback scenes are so well done, they explain so much about the killer with so little dialogue. The delivery, the mise en scene, geez it was overwhelming. The end was prolonged JUST enough, the pacing is really good. KUBRICK thought this was the scariest film - including his own The Shining - that he'd seen, and that tells you right off the bat how incredible this movie is. The suspense is notched up so slowly you don't even realize how wound up you are at the end! And this film is so good, you don't notice the horrid 80's euromusic in the score lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vanishing is Very Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" is such a disturbing movie that I don't know if I would recommend it to other to watch. The premise, that there are these crazy people in the world randomly abducting and killing people in a way that makes it almost impossible to catch the killers or find the bodies of the victims is presented in a very realistic an, therefore, terrorizing way. It reminds me what real profilers of serial killers say, that to get into the mind of the serial killer and catch him, you have to think like a serial killer...even though it scares the bejesus out of the profiler to do so. I compare "The Vanishing" to "The Hunt" (2012), a recent and brilliant film about a man (played by Mads Mikkelsen) accused to being a pedophile. Gripping, but very disturbing. Also of note: Neither "The Vanishing" nor "The Hunt" has anything graphic about it. Yet both are far more thought-promoting that the typical Hollywood blood and gore "Criminal Minds"-like fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent art-house crime thriller !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic storyline of 'The Vanishing' involves a Dutch couple namely Saskia and Rex who have come to France as tourists with the intention of spending their vacation together. But they get separated when Saskia suddenly vanishes in thin air. Rex obsessively tries to find out what happened to her over the next few years while experiencing constant frustration and the film comes to a terrifying conclusion.I am writing this review after watching this for the 2nd time. After my first viewing I remember liking this very much. But after having watched this again, I have no hesitation in stating that I now love this film. There are so many things that I missed on my first viewing which I noticed now. Even though I knew what was coming and what the final climax will be all about, but I still think that the my 2nd viewing was more stimulating than the first one.First of all, 'The Vanishing' is a very visual film. There are so many visual metaphors and symbolism that the perceptive and attentive viewer will notice. Saskia tells Rex in the initial part of the film about one of her nightmares and after knowing the ultimate denouement, that dream seems like a premonition. The central theme of the film is destiny. The film explores whether you can defy what is predestined or will destiny always have the last laugh. One of the best things about the film is that we already know who the kidnapper of Saskia is right from the get go. He is not a Hollywood bad guy. He is almost the antithesis of every Hollywood villain. He is just an average guy who has a loving family, but his mind and his logic work in the most deranged way. In a great sense, this film is more about the exploration and the study of this kidnapper than anything else. The director takes his time to follow this character and observe his actions and the processes he employs and his experiments and his rehearsals to get ready for the actual kidnapping. 'The Vanishing', I think involves one of the most deep character studies of a psychopath and the climax which is the ultimate revelation is one of the most chilling and horrifying climaxes ever.The screenplay which gets non-linear at times is brilliantly written and it beautifully complements the visual style of the direction and the cinematography. The film takes its time to build up the characters and story instead of truckloads of forced exposition. So much about the characters and story is revealed with subtle movements of the camera or a subtle facial gesture or a subtle word that gets spoken. It really has all the understated subtlety that you expect from a European art-house film. The Vanishing is a beautifully made film that has everything that you want from a thriller, but it delivers all of that in a very visually artistic way. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well..well..well...The End and How it happens is debatable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First - this is not a horror movie. This may be scary to people if they knew before hand that this movie is about a young girl who suddenly vanished and never again appeared. The plot looks good. But the way it unravels after the guy finds out his wife vanished is highly debatable. If somebody's wife was kidnapped by some person, would he travel around with that kidnapper in a car sipping coffee with him even if the kidnapper offered a ride? Would he talk to him so that the kidnapper could psyche him out? Would he have anything to do with him at all? Well these are highly debatable. Mostly I feel that this movie wove a story so unrealistic at important places so as to create the "wow" or the unexpected. Okay ?but is the movie engrossing and engaging you right from the beginning? Yes - true. Surely the viewer would sit from the beginning till the end of the movie - so as to just know - what happened to the girl - just like her boy friend - Rex?. Go and watch it. It's highly engrossing. My rating for this alone is 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The way this movie jumped through time kept me guessing and made me pay more attention to the movie. Compared to Spoorloos, The Vanishing wasn't as great. All of the information in the movie was given to us and we weren't given the chance to think about it. In my opinion, the ending was what made the whole movie seem real. The bad guy wins in Spoorloos. It doesn't have any of the famous American happy endings. Also, the killer in the movie seemed like a normal average guy. This made the situation a lot scarier and it made us think more. i mean, for all we know our neighbor could also be a killer. In the American version, the bad guy played the stereotypical bad guy.Overall I would like to say that this movie was a thrill to watch because it made us figure out was was going on by ourselves and the information wasn't spoon fed to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoorloos, a Dutch/French thriller lives up to it's genre. It is first and foremost a psychological thriller in which the audience pretty much understands what's happening, but has to go through the agony of the Rex Hoffman character who, as Raymond the antagonist puts, never had the chance to fall out of love. (spoiler) This is of course the vanishing of his vivacious girlfriend. The filmmakers craft the antagonist better than the other characters - a self-described sociopath who tries to give us in words what motivates his despicable actions. He is a family man but obviously is beyond the pale. The music affords a haunting 80s odd feel. And the lead several actors all perform well, especially Raymond. Additionally there's some interesting philosophical banter associated with destiny - if you reverse a choice after going with your original hunch, are you altering reality somehow? A solid outing for the genre worth a look - a little bit aged though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite unexpectedly, I was given this film as a gift on my birthday and I watched it last night. Unfortunately, I do not speak either of the two languages spoken by the actors ( Dutch and French ) and had to rely on the subtitles.In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey that director Sluizer took me on. Johanna ter Steege is fantastic as the slightly kooky Saskia. To make a film about someone's disappearance one really has to care about that person, and through Johanna's performance, this is instantly achievable.The other principle actor's performances are equally as solid, with Bervoets playing the traumatised boyfriend. I wasn't quite sure what to make of Donnadieu when I first saw him. His character didn't seem to be this evil guy that I thought he was supposed to be. As the film rolls on, it becomes clear that he's something far more complex that just plain evil and it gives you a clear view of what makes Raymond Lemorne tick. And it's quite a scary place to be.There are a couple of scenes that don't work brilliantly for me, notably those involving the rest of the Lemorne family, but this is no way detracts from the film as a whole.I don't believe I have seen any other films by Sluizer but he has done enough here to ensure that I go check them out. Quite interestingly he appears to have directed a Hollywood remake of this film, also called The Vanishing. I'm not sure he could have topped the original but this is so good I'm going to have to check it out anyway.I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this film.It is a suspense classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film on Hungarian TV and I can honestly say it's the best Franco-Dutch film dubbed into Hungarian that I've ever seen... The film is excellent on a number of levels. First there's the main men: the boyfriend and the abductor. Here we have a fascinating contrast between two different but related obsessions, wonderfully portrayed by the actors. Then there's the filmic technique. The attention to detail is perfect - I've rewound the tape a few times and can't fault it. We're drawn in by the realism and the everyday nature of the action into a nightmare world. Finally there's the suspense. It's great the way the mystery deepens and is then gradually stripped away until our mouths are fixed open in shock. The finest moment for me is the Hitchcockian scene in the town square when our hero thinks he is about to meet the villain. All a product of a warped mind maybe, but still good art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been stated a few times not to watch the remake but I think it deserves hammering home. I made the mistake of watching the 1993 remake myself not knowing much about the original. The remake cops out and doesn't leave you with the gut wrenching feeling I so cherish at the end of Seven and The Usual Suspects. It also goes part of the way to spoiling the ending of the original, as you can pretty much guess it then which spoils the feeling. This is a brilliant film otherwise, much superior to the remake in more than just the ending. Its portrait of a disturbed mind is one of the best and uncliched I've seen. The only problem being is when you know the ending it takes away the shock value and a lot of the suspense. The movie however is good enough to surpass these flaws and is still worth watching even if you know the shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first George Sluizer's film, a bleak but tantalizing examination of psychological sociopath and the obsession of finding out the truth beneath. The plot-line is pretty straightforward, Rex (Bervoets) and Saskia (ted Steege) are a young Dutch couple on a vacation to France, en route, they stop in a busy gas station and Saskia is disappeared, three years later, the abductor Raymond Lemorne (Donnadieu) contacts Rex, the latter has been bedeviled by the incident ever since, Raymond asks Rex if he is willing to face the same treatment which Saskia had experienced so as to conclude his pathological obsession, his answer is astonishingly perverse and the finale is uncompromisingly gut-wrenching.The film starts with a foreboding tunnel accident, where Rex waywardly leaves Saskia alone in the pitch-black, there is a cryptic smile on his face when he is walking out of the tunnel to fetch gasoline, viewers may think - what is he thinking? what a complete jerk! Not to mention it is completely his fault for running out of gas in the first place! As one might expect Saskia will be mysteriously gone when he returns, it doesn't happen, but the scar is clearly lacerated, however they mend fences pretty soon, as Rex apologizes and explains that it is the moment when he leaves her there that he realizes how much he loves her. This perhaps justifies the smile, but it is deeply dark. They arrive the bustling gas station and Sluizer immediately introduces the perpetrator Raymond in parallel, but the narrative is still homing in on the lovebirds, after some casual flirting, a romantic ceremony to bury coins under one of the trees and a promise that she will never be abandoned by him, Saskia goes to the convince store and never comes back. After that, it is Rex's futile and desperate attempt to find her, until the morning after.Then, the film steers into Raymond's life, he is a chemistry teacher and has a perfect family, a gentle wife with two daughters admire him. But his dark side is innate, it is his passion to be a sociopath, his rehearsal of the abduction, detailedly recording his heart rates, it is utterly radical existentialism for him to implement his wrongdoings, he can be the hero to rescue a drowning girl, at the same time, he can ruthlessly murder a totally strange woman, there is no logical motivation, whatsoever, which is the most bone-chilling fact the film dares to divulge. Meanwhile, Rex is entrapped in the mystery, his persistence pushes his new girlfriend Lieneke (Eckhaus) away and his option between letting-go and embracing the worst outcome is the harbinger of his fate. When Raymond suddenly appears in front of him, apart from the initial rage, he is deadly under his clutches, up until the final decision, cogently enhanced by Henny Vrienten's thrilling score and the final blow is when finding the coins he and Saskia buried, he cannot run away from his oath, his suicidal act is simultaneously beyond credibility and thoroughly conceivable, it is the only way to follow his incubus to the hilt. The three leading performances are all awards-worthy, Donnadieu is formidably sinister and Bervoets singles out his desperation with awesome commitment, Johanna ter Steege, as the innocent victim, demonstrates how easily one can approach the doom by a whimsy of credulity. Arguably one of the darkest ending in the film history, THE VANISHING is the sort which one dare not to revisit since it leaves indelible imprint on one's memory with poignantly awe-and- shock side effect, it is also a cautionary tale to warn us never get into a stranger's car, no matter how innocuous or benevolent he or she looks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one has presented me with somewhat of a problem a few years ago, and still does today. In the '90s I had seen the remake without knowing of the original or even the novel, and I liked it, pretty much loved it; the fact that the good guy wins was something I could live with. But, then I heard of 'Spoorloos' and had to see it. And they feel like different films in some respects. The setting of this original, in picturesque France (at many times while the Tour de France is going on in the background via car radios and such) is perfect, where the setting of the remake is mostly simply sufficient. Of course, the dark ending is a better choice in itself, BUT: the fact that Rex finally succumbs to Raymond's proposition can only mean that he has gone completely crazy. Even if the build-up unveils his haphazard, romantic character quite clearly at several moments, his final choice still is a bridge too far for me (which would be a problem in the remake too, of course). The romance becomes a nihilistic affair.In spite of that big point of critique, this original has still so much to offer that I can not stay mad at its ending. The acting is great (even if I didn't know what to think of Johanna ter Steege's contribution at times - great, and wholly in spirit with those peculiar '80s? or awkwardly forced? I can't decide), the story takes many interesting turns, the cinematography is wonderful, etc., etc..So, still a big 8 out of 10. I'm not going to try the remake again for a while, though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rex is the problem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May be this review is more for me than any reader.Couple points:-The free will and random life vs fate, dream symbolism, destiny fear.-Light in the tunnel (light-dark) buried alive: she looks for the flashlight gambling her life to luck inside the car (everyone does stupid things) he turns away and follow his reason and smile when she desperate scream at him. She had predicted the consequences, he blindly followed his certainty. -Measuring everything the obsessed CLAUSTROPHOBIC chemistry professor developed a precise procedure that fails: lowering his cardiac rhythm in a process to be calm and perform accurate, the echo test of his family screaming to test noise range, miles to drive after induce sleeping, the broken arm trick to not fail in attracting the victim, but at the end events just developed to accomplish his goal without trying. He confessed the idea, the plan, the obsession, the systematization, the perseverance, the success as a probe to himself that it's possible. The jump to the street, "what if I do what I don't suppose to do", "the murderer it's only linked for his motivation", "capable of the best and the worst", "what's worst than dying?" a common status guy, that naturally for a french culture would look for an affair because he's in age, decide to go for a better accomplishment than prostitutes. -She trying to speak French with him, being too close, too confident, like she's already seen the picture of his family in the car, too many people, the stolen bicycles a common crime that simple is completely untraceable. Missing foreign people, the no-places, the wait to mark them as lost, the careless, the well known kafkanian bureaucracy, frustration, the impotence, uncertainty, how hard would the public force put into this case?The key:-Rex drinking the coffee. He's obsession is deluded, even when he is brought back every year for the murderer's letters to the same town, same anniversary. The ping pong balls, the coke and beer, the promise to never leave her again ever, the golden eggs in the space dream, he's not rage or vendetta feeling, not hate to the murderer, just to find the truth, just to find and ANSWER that release him from finding the house where they were going to spend their vacations, the coins have to keep together, destiny, the map in his apt, the pile of folders, videos, his TV appearance "I'm going to go to wherever it needs to find out the truth" "nothing will stop me", not even a new love, someone to not loss again, not even that.Did Rex really show us all that? the burden feeling of not find answer in who should look for our security. Who ever has been victim of a crime and no answer was ever given to him/her. Can really wait? for what? The harmless murderer surrendering at his place, like 7 seven, "i only know the truth" "if anything happen to me i have everything arrange"? in 5 minutes i'll leave" the rig. Strong enough? what about beating up the guy, you may feel in control, not really threatened. why people just get in a car with someone they had met at the bar? haven't you done that? what if there is that chance? being confuse, many feelings. is it really that impossible? it might happen to anybody in the right state of mind. the Rex we saw, is he the problem?</fullReview>

I Am Not Just Saying That, This Film Has Character Development For Gene Bervoets's Character That I Actually Wanted Him To Find Johanna Ter Steege's Character.The Only Problem With This Film For Some People Is That It Didn't Have A Happy Ending.

		<fullReview>This is really a movie that any thriller-adept must see. From early on right to the end you'll be wondering whatever happened, and the end is a real surprise (which I will not spoil for you). This is a classical psychological thriller.Superb acting, good camera-work and a really good script based on Tim Krabbé's novel. The US remake from 1993 (The Vanishing, starring Jeff Bridges, Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock) is a must-see because of the starring actors (from which I like Sutherland a lot), but the story is less thrilling, and the end is too obvious. If you get the chance: go see "Spoorloos"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that I really enjoyed this film is a slight understatement.It has been many years since I last saw it, but since finding IMDb, it was one of the first movies I looked up! It is one of those films that really sticks in your head and you find yourself thinking about it for weeks after and telling all your friends about it and trying to convince them that subtitled movies are so worth watching! The suspense was so finely tuned and the ending just superb that the events and characters were made to feel so possible and so probable. The remake is a waste of space, losing all the truly fine detail and nuances of the actors and characterization of the original and supplanting a happy ending that destroys the whole tone you find set in the original. I give it a ten out of ten for the impact it made on me as a great piece of drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful young couple's holiday is curtailed when Rex's wife goes suddenly missing. So begins this 'strange', haunting Dutch psychological drama, which, although it may not win prizes for artistic merit, will leave its dubious presence lingering on your mind. Rex's relentless pursuit of the truth leads him to the banal Raymond.The murderer's warped philosophy almost makes him 'godlike'; he once saved a man from drowning and performed a good deed, so according to his skewed rationale, he felt obliged to perform an evil act to maintain the balance. What makes his act(s) so shocking are that they are the actions of a normal, everyday family man. As one poster stated, evil can be found in the guise of the most ordinary person next door. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS*******SPOILERS******SPOILERS*******SPOILERS I've had this on my shelf for a while, buying it from a bargain bin sometime ago. I remembered watching this film on late night telly and being captured not only by the fantastic sinister edge, which is so well under played by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu as Raymond, but also by the whole feeling of helplessness as the 'hero, Rex, continues his vain search for Saskia - the very lovely Johanna ter Steege.I think what most stuck with me was the ending. I always felt that the ending was so brave at the time, being as I had been fed on American TVMs and the like. Before I saw the light. And this is one of the reasons why I have a love for this film, as Spoorloos was probably one of the first foreign language films I had ever seen. This made me want to broaden beyond the TVM genre and I believe that I have only benefited since.The story is well played including the build up as to how Saskia eventually gets abducted in the service station. Who knows, if Raymond hadn't bumped into his daughter's teacher it could have all been so different. The look of panic in Saskia's eyes as Raymond applies the chloroform........oh dear !!It's all played out in a very credible manner. The mind games between Rex and Raymond - will the police believe Rex or should he go along with Raymond and follow the path that Saskia took ?? It's a conundrum that George Sluizer, the Director, offers to the viewer and even at the end, although probably obvious that Rex will follow Raymond to the his fateful conclusion, there is a just a moment where.......well, maybe.But it's the ending that wins it over for me. What was Saskia's fate ?? The audience is left to wonder whether Raymond did in fact bury Saskia alive. He has already pointed out that he is a pyschopath after all, but still, surely 'he ain't that mad'.Well played out, and an enjoyable 100 mins in front of the box for once. I don't think I'll let the dust gather for long before I get this one off the shelf again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-average psychological thriller, French and Dutch with English subtitles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, 'The Vanishing (Spoorlos)', was remade as a 1993 movie of the same title, starring Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland. Now that I have seen them both, I consider this one, the original, as clearly the better movie. Aside from different locales (remake shot on USA West Coast), the two movies are almost the same until the very end. They end quite differently, and this original one has the ending which better fits with the overall story. The DVD is nice with only the trailer as an extra, and the English subtitles work fine. There are two themes here, the mind of the sociopath, and how 'fate' can make such a big difference in the paths of our lives. Worth the 105 minutes for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my remarks, quit reading now under penalty of severe disillusionment.In both versions the Chemistry professor is fastidious, planning and rehearsing every detail of the capture of the lady he seeks. But he doesn't succeed because every candidate hesitates to get into his car when he either asks for directions or help of some sort. Until he realizes he must appear weaker, he puts his arm in a fake cast, and that works, the girl gets into his car, he closes the door, walks around the back, puts ether on his handkerchief, has to sneeze, inadvertently puts the ether on his own face, then has to excuse himself hurriedly as the intended victim leaves. After he recovers, about to 'write off' that day, the eventual victim is talking to him inside the gas stop, near the coffee machine, notices the 'R' key fob, goes to his car to 'buy one', and that is when she succumbs. So, the 'choice' of victim was totally random, accidental, only because (1) they had run out of gas earlier and had to stop there and (2) his clumsiness with the ether. Is it fate? Similar themes played out in 'Sliding Doors', 'Unfaithful', and 'Run, Lola, Run', the idea that one small difference in what actually happened could have changed the whole outcome of the rest of the lives of the people involved. I identify with that theme, as it is a truism in our own lives. I would have taken a completely different path in life, had Ronald Reagan NOT been governor of California in 1967.Biggest SPOILER follows - the remake ended with the boyfriend being dug up by his new girlfriend, then he went back and killed the professor, and we assume his original missing girlfriend has been buried and dead for 3 years. Not very imaginative. In this, original, version the husband (they were married) wakes up to find himself in the box, under ground, and later we see the whole family enjoying the grounds of the cottage in the country, and we know both the young wife and her young husband are buried there, the professor's little secret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man's girlfriend disappears at a highway rest stop. It's an intriguing premise that is poorly executed. It generates suspense but the plot lacks focus and there's no payoff. It's meant to be a psychological thriller, but the abductor's motives are not explained - only some amateurish psycho babble and laughably bad flashbacks of his exploits. It's not a who done it, but what and why done it. The film does not answer either of these questions. It's meant to be a character study, but the characters are not developed and they behave in bizarre ways. Supposedly a dual personality, Donnadieu is too creepy and one-dimensional to be convincing as a loving family man. A big letdown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it starts out great and sets up a tense plot, but like so many movies, characters act as they never would in real life just for the sake of script. (Remember "Red Rock West"? Nicholas Cage should have just left town as any normal person would, but he didn't.) In this film, any real-life person would have gone to the police at the key moment. But our hero Rex? No, he takes a different, ridiculous path. It really stretches all credibility. So if you can stand characters people doing things real people would never do for the sake of moving a plot forward, then this is the film for you. But if not, skip this one. Overall, completely unsatisfying.</fullReview>

The plot unfolds at an almost painfully sluggish pace, and came across as very disjointed and overly drawn out in places. Very little insight was established in terms of what Rex really had to endure with the disappearance of his lover, the film almost makes her disappearance seem trivial in it's execution. The protagonist/the kidnapper was lacking in the character development department too, small insights into his early boyhood behaviors and apparent sociopathic personality are presented, but in my opinion executed very poorly. Overall a pretty uneventful film, I really do not understand the intrigue at all.</fullReview>

The movie does not need to have a fairy tale ending, but this is disgusting, that's what it is DISGUSTING. I recommend not wasting your time if the end matters to you. To me when a movie is made well, like this one we recognize with the characters and then it leaves an impact on us, whatever happens to the characters. An evil movie. But very well directed, great direction, very good cinematography as well. But I could not waste my time after watching half of the movie I though it would matter how this ends, so I would rather check how this ends, I did and threw the DVD in the Trash, I literally broke it in two and threw it in the trash.</fullReview>

It comes across as low budget indie fare.The idea was interesting although not a surprise to me as I had seen the remake many years ago but only just got round to watching the original.Some of it is a bit far fetched, like when the main character drinks the coffee at the end once he has met the kidnapper, even though he knows it is laced with sleeping pills, because he is given the option of experiencing what his kidnapped girlfriend experienced or never knowing what happened to her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoorloos was overall a good film but it was sort of like an original American film that sort of give away what is going to happen, they are traveling and they are a couple, I automatically knew that something bad was going to happen to at least one of them. The story is good but like i said before, something things are obvious and to me when things are like that they are less exciting. Something that I really like about the movie was the way that it cuts to one scene and then it cuts to another scene, but the scenes incorporated in the skit end up going together really well. Another thing that i was really interested in was the little small symbols that were in the movie(the eggs and the coins). The egg was something that was brought up in a dream that Saskia had. The coins were something these two couples buried that symbolizes that they will be together forever. You could assume that they were next to each other when they were buried. The eggs even symbolize what he was in when he got captured by the serial killer. Saskia said she was in a closed object and she was screaming trying to get out, this automatically told me that one of them two was going to end up in that situation. Overall i think that the director did a good job incorporating the story to the message, and he also did a good job in showing the audience when the symbols in the movie appear, overall its a good film, i just didn't like that i knew what was going to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a creepy film, in a subtle way. The odd thing is that almost all the actual images could safely be seen by almost anyone. If you plonked a small, impressionable child in front of the screen with the sound off, hardly any of it would give her/him nightmares.For example, quite a large chunk of the film just shows people at a service station in France, in the 1980s. There are toilets, there are frisbees on sale for 13,50 francs (they use a comma as a decimal point in France), people are talking, cars come and go, everything seems sunny and normal. It looks very realistic, maybe because I've been to France (in the 1980s) and haven't been to some countries where a lot of films are made.Yet, despite being low on scary images and devoid of gore, an air of real menace is created.There is some philosophising, but not too much. The points about random chance are made without being laboured.I quibble with the choice of "The Vanishing" as the English title. In my opinion, "vanishing" does not sound right as a noun. The Dutch title could have been translated as "Without a Trace", as the TV series of that name came much later than this film.The English subtitles on the DVD I saw were slightly clunky at times (why put 62 miles rather than 100 km?). I suspect that the discussion about surnames influenced Tarantino, and the ending was not a million miles (1.6 million km) from the "CSI" double episode he wrote.I would say this was proof that a film can succeed with a low budget and relatively obscure cast, if the script is right.</fullReview>

"Vanishing", however is a movie for the ages. Instead of relying on gore and special effects to try to outwit a dimwitted adolescent audience, it uses the old verities, such as plot, pacing, and genuine emotional involvement of its characters to rivet its audience to the screen, which is exactly what its director, George Sluizer, does with seemingly little effort. But don't be fooled, in Sluizer's hands this medium is an art form and he overwhelms his audience by the end of the movie. Don't miss this one.

The character development in this French/Dutch film is fantastic in that this is the first time I've ever been drawn to the evil character, but the lag time in the movie slows it down immensely, which is it's only problem. While trying to get you to know the man behind the mysterious disappearance of a Dutchman's girlfriend, some parts of the film drag on to no end, and then pick up finally after one specific scene, being a car-ride where it picks up and doesn't fail. When the Dutchman finally meets the evil man, the dialog and scenes are impeccable, leading up to an astonishing ending that made me feel very empty. A great thriller, even after the long, drawn out parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie that will make you forget how bad Dutch movies can be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really one of the scariest Dutch movies ever made. During the whole movie you will be wondering what happened to Saskia, and when you finally find out, it will scare the hell into you!!!! You would have been happier if you hadn't find out what happened to her!The movie is about the fear and emotions of not-knowing. The main character Rex will do everything to find out what happened to Saskia, even if he has to suffer from the same pain.The acting in Spoorloos is great. Gene Bervoets does a good job making Rex as desperately as anyone would be after they've found out their wife was gone. Johanna ter Steege is also a very talented actress and it's too bad she had to disappear in the beginning. Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu makes Raymond one of the most interesting serial-killers I have ever seen on screen. Raymond has a sort-of decease that pushes him to doing things he believes he can. Though he's a sick person, he is extremely smart and very normal (He has a wife and kids). That makes him a strange and very scary man.Like I said, this is one of the best Dutch movies I have ever seen. If you live in Holland and you haven't seen it yet, go rent it!!! If you live anywhere else, go to your video store and see if they have a dubbed version, but DON'T rent the US remake with Sandra Bullock, because it has a different plot and the brilliant ending was changed into a stupid Hollywood-ending wich makes it an ordinary not-interesting thriller.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, this movie was no Jack Frost (or any other movie with a hologram sleeve, for that matter); this movie helped me find sleep, so naturally, I failed to see what made its disciples lose sleep. And don't tell me that I can't appreciate a psychological thriller - "Silence of the Lambs" is one of the greatest films ever created. Perhaps it was because it was subtitled that I didn't care too much for it. Then again, so was "Life is Beautiful," so scrap that theory. The dialogue made me want to flip channels until I found a bridge game I could watch, and the only thing shocking about the ending was that I had spent such a large portion of my life waiting it out.

		<shortDescription>Not my classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie is interesting to experience for some reason I can hardly describe, Spoorloos would never really come to any kind of climax or even make a significant step towards anything like a real conclusion. Bernard- Pierre Donnadieu's impression of THE BROKEN MAN on the other hand is vague, overdone and sometimes embarrassing to watch. The scene with him screaming out "Saskia" in frustration in the middle of the city made me nearly handpalm my self. With barely any positive personality trait to hang on to, his supposed passion was too easily to be mistaken for simple stupidity and as the biggest downer I needed to interpret the movies notorious ending as merely the result of that. Do not trust someone, who kidnapped your gal to narcotize you. If that's not clear to you, please note that now. I never found any reason to just nearly fall for Saskia or Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu's interesting but highlight-free performance either. The rest, despite originality is mostly just boring. Not my classic, sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The symbolism is probably deeper than most people care to look (possibly including me); I would say that developing tunnel-vision (pun intended) regarding certain obsessions people entertain is certainly not a novel concept; everyone has fallen victim to acting on impulse in a sometimes overly aggressive manner, especially when there is guilt or shame to be accounted for brewing in the past, overly zealous defenses bubble to the surface and blind us from deconstructing the obsession and nurturing the observing ego, who would ordinarily red-flag us to when we are doing something potentially harmful. Now, all this to say that the protagonist became fixated on discovering what fate his former romantic partner had encountered, and this hampered any further development of relationships; he clearly would rather be situated in the past than attempt to readapt to present circumstances. Now, from a psychopathic standpoint, vulnerability is to be quickly and mercilessly destroyed. Thus, the kidnapper, showing no emotion whatsoever, takes this broken man through a rather insipidly sadistic journey through the torments of his methodology. In the end, the choice made by our hero is to be confronted by a very real version of his conflict, either abandon the past and its perils or fall victim to it, the consequences of which can be dire. He chose the latter, and his obsession, which already had metaphorical walls keeping it at bay from any real-world influence, ended up creating physical walls, symbolizing how there truly never was any escape from this sordid psychic reality. When faced with the absurdity of our self-imposed chains, what else can one do but laugh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of mystery fare such as "Sleuth" are most likely going to find this creepy tale engrossing.The scenario's credibility depends on whether the viewer buys Rex's compulsive desire to satisfy his curiosity about missing Saskia--which is fully exploited and utilized by abductor Raymond."Spoorloos" is a thinking-persons' sort of tale, especially geared for intellectual types, who'll most likely accept the "reverse logic" of Rex in finally imbibing the crucial "witch's brew." Scripter George Sluizer and writer-novelist Tim Krabbe obviously put a lot of effort into creating this macabre yarn. Apparently, judging from ratings by critics and public alike, a goodly number viewers bought into its strange predestination rationale which comprises the denouement.It's the sort of thing even an Edgar Allen Poe might savor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terrifying. When I say "terrifying", I really mean it; I don't think that anyone that has feelings can stay quiet at its view. Recorded with an outrageous sensibility that lives through the words (this is not a metaphor actually: the movie is in dutch and french and I don't speak any of them, still without the lacking subtitles it thrilled the hell out of me), you won't see here the classic (and boring, and bad) horror movie.Because horror is human, the director relies the main plot on enduring, tender human films, which is weird for the genre, but most convenient. There are many films that rely on absences, but I haven't had the chance of watching one that does it so well until now: A girl disappears and her friend looks for her. Great, you'd say that's just crap. But it is not. Because of the warm performances of both actors, you actually *do* believe everything. And then there's the end of the film. Be sensible and don't watch this film alone. Otherwise, I welcome you to the kingdom of nightmares. I dare anyone who doesn't feel miserable and moved after this film to go down to hell and happily burn there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Vanishing 1988" tells of the dogged search of a man for his girlfriend who disappears while they're together on holiday. Not a "thriller", this psychodrama spends most of its time dwelling on the criminal mind of the abductor, the anxiety and angst of the abductee's boyfriend, and flashbacking to show what transpired from the abductor's perspective after setting up the story with the boyfriend's perspective. The film is well crafted realism and a worthy watch for those who don't mind subtitles.From the same novel as the later American version (circa 1993), movie purist agree this Europic is superior to the Hollywood product but then, aren't they all?

Rex KNEW she was dead. Then during the car drive, during that scene where Raymond jumps off the bridge to save the struggling girl, the girl after rescued tells Raymond, "Bigule drowned, that man wouldn't save her" Raymond looks at her kind of cracking up, like I just risked myself to save her, and then she accuses me of letting her doll drown. Then immediately after, Raymonds daughter says to him, "you are a hero", and he tells Rex in the car,that his daughters words meant nothing to him, Unless he was absolutely INCAPABLE of doing something evil, then he says, at that very moment I logically conceived to do the most horrible thing i could imagine. Now if you watch carefully the scene after the goofball cloroforms himself, he goes into the bathroom laughing walks out and says these words "destiny Mr. Hoffman" then proceeds to talk with Rex's girlfriend. Anybody know why he said that ?. Also during the drive to France, Raymond tells Rex, if you decide to kill me, I understand that, and I'm willing to take that risk, betting on your curiosity. Rex knew the girl was dead, but the incredible grief and guilt he felt for his role in the event made him him take the fate he knew of. Remember after he drinks the coffee, he begins paraphrasing Raymond about predermination in the same words that Raymond used when describing his jump to the cement. Once Rex came to conclusion that Raymond was free of the crime in relation to the law, he made one last attempt at taking his girlfriends keys from Raymond, but eventually resigned to the same fate as his girlfriend. In my opinion Raymond was equally open to his own murder by Rex or to complete the desire of Rex. Everybody loses in that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>seems to me this movie is getting excessive praise only because it's a euro flick, and therefore by default inherently better than the Hollywood remake (which i haven't seen, so i'll take everybody's word for it). well, let me try to objectively break it down for you. a guy's girlfriend disappears (and since they were a playfully loving couple, it's immediately obvious it's in fact a case of involuntary disappearance) and the guy spends the next 3 years looking for her. at his wit's end, he scrapes his last francs and goes public (stating he only wants to know what happened and not punish the kidnapper, mind you). the kidnapper sees it, admires the guy's perseverance, and decides to contact him.so far so good, right? only now you're already way past 1 h into the movie. and here's where things start to go terribly downhill. after 3 soul-wrecking years of search and uncertainty, the guy simply gets in the car with the kidnapper and calmly listens to his drawn-out recount of the events, again pointing out he only wants to know what happened? puh-leeease. what do you think happened? she's been missing for THREE YEARS, buddy, it's obvious he killed her or did something terrible to her. the two talk like they're the best of buddies, with some of the most insanely unlikely, almost comical dialog ever. i find it HIGHLY implausible that ANYONE would simply sit there and listen to the guy's story about how he put the love of your life to sleep and kidnapped her, after several failed attempts to do so with other women (flashback scenes which also unintentionally border on comedy, ruining what little "suspense" the movie managed to produce), after which she disappears forever. how can you just want to know what happened, and not punish the guy who did it? maybe the dutch are total weaklings with skewed logic, i don't know. i would've tortured the guy until he confessed. or at least trust the hand of the law and forensics. anyways, (SPOILER ALERT!) the kidnapper offers the guy to go through the same experience by offering him to drink a sleeping pills-laced coffee. yeah, sure - drink it up, buddy, that's surely the ONLY way to know. the dude does so and ends up in a coffin, buried alive. he wakes from his drug-induced sleep and although we can see that there's some light seeping through the cracks (so it's obvious the coffin's still not totally covered in dirt), the dude wastes what little oxygen he has by running his lighter and feebly tapping on the lid. dude, kick it like your life depends on it! and that's it. the killer's motive? his wifey and daughters thought too highly of him, so he wanted to see if he was capable of doing evil things, thus burying two people alive. come on. during one of the scenes he pointed out that "there are worst things than death", leading you to mistakenly believe our hero's loved one met some terribly untoward fate. yet it turns out it's nothing but the plain old murder. also, much time has been devoted to depicting the killer as some sort of a numbers-obsessed math-whiz (hinting at a "beautiful mind"-ish angle), and a pedantic perfectionist. yet he comically botches the first few kidnap attempts. once he even accidentally uses his "weapon", the chloroform-soaked napkin, to wipe his nose, thus putting himself to sleep in what has to be one of the most out-of-place and pointlessly "humorous" scenes in what's otherwise tauted as the "most disturbing movie ever". people, PLEASE. in the end, this whole math angle comes to one big NOTHING and could've easily been left out completely - the killer could've been a delivery guy, with absolutely NO detriments to the story WHATSOEVER.to wrap it up, this is a drawn-out and unlikely flick that just reeks of excessive European noodling and self-importance. kind of like "irreversible": 10 amazing minutes amidst heaps of vacuous philosophizing and dialog. it makes me want to see the US remake - at least it's characters might act with more common sense and logic and the director won't be laboring under the illusion he's creating a timeless peace of life-changing art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>some people are amazed by this movie, even chilled, but i thought it was a complete waste of my time. the entire first two acts of the film are great, setting up a tense situation where the viewer is intently waiting to see the dramatic climax. and then the whole thing goes to hell! my only qualm is that the ending is entirely unbelievable. no one, NO ONE, would volunteer for this uncertain fate. i can't believe that this man, the protagonist, would be so distraught that he'd volunteer to suffer the same fate as his mysteriously absent girlfriend. she was obviously dead; she never tried to make contact with her old life. so, either he is the world's laziest suicide, unable to commit the act himself, or he's an idiot. as i watched the movie, when the protagonist is presented with the choice of finding out what happened to Saskia by undergoing the exact same treatment, i almost turned the movie off. all i could think was that there was a third choice: beat the kidnapper into a pulp, take his ass back to your apartment, and torture the information out of him. not agree to die at the hands of the same bastard who killed your girl. hey, maybe i'm just too American to appreciate the emotional damage motivating this man's inexhaustible search, but all i know is that, given the same situation, my own need to know could be instantly replaced by an undying homicidal urge that i would gladly focus on the kidnapper who created this void in my life. i certainly wouldn't sign up to be buried alive. and just why does this budding killer bury people in the first place? he goes through all that preparation so he can just bury his victims? wouldn't he rather see their anguish? i just think all these characters are flat, thoughtless interpretations of how real people would conduct themselves in similar situation with similar motivations. i think this movie was written by a monkey with no human insight and the idea that people are genuinely frightened by this schlock causes me to doubt moviegoers more than i already do. personally, i think the deranged neighbor kid from Toy Story is more psychologically thrilling than this foreign rag.</fullReview>

Having a first look, this is an ordinary thriller with a memorable ending. But there is more to this film. In some ways, Spoorloos resembles a modern version of any story by Edgar Allan Poe. The creepy thing about Spoorloos is not violence, screaming and blood, but the sensation that it might be based on reality rather than fiction. This film shows that sudden disappearance and "not knowing" is far more scary than all devils and ghosts in Hollywood.I get the feeling that this film is of the rare kind that grows with the years 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my ultimate favourite films. It is not about the action but the fact that the main character is a sociopath. The film puts so much detail into how he is to commit the act just to see if he 'feels' anything and shows how unemotional he really is (this is the scary part). He chooses the worst crime he can think of (being a claustrophobic) and then plans it meticulously. The ending is shocking when you put all the pieces together of what he has done earlier in the film leading up to this, even involving his children screaming to see how far it travels! I think the remake ruins the whole premise and meaning of the film and advise anyone to watch this one. He shows no remorse just a morbid curiosity of other peoples emotions.Truly a cold calculating scary man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Vanishing was a critical success from the very beginning, earning the leading lady an award and spawning a Hollywood remake. Maybe time has taken its toll on the viewing experience of Sluizer's movie, because when I rented and watched it last night, I was not very impressed. The premise of the movie is still interesting enough and, although a little rough around the edges, the cinematography and direction is well crafted.The story of a man who becomes obsessed with uncovering what happened to his girlfriend after she vanished from a gas station three years ago is told effectively and uses a goal driven narrative to makes the viewer identify with the protagonist. Just as Rex becomes more and more determined to find out what happened, while the loving feelings for the girl are long gone, so are we. The kidnapper taunts Rex and the audience by promising answers but only if we let him stay in control. But ultimately I found the movie terribly flawed through major plot holes and was left a bit baffled by the amazing ratings it got. If Rex kept getting post cards and letters from the kidnapper, why did he not go to the police and shared those messages? Surely that would have helped hunting down the bad guy. And swallowing the sleeping pill is, hands down, one of the craziest, stupidest things I've ever seen in a scary movie. Especially since the kidnapper keeps phrasing his promises of revelation as if he was going to kill Rex. I understand Rex's obsession, but at this point the movie lost me and I detached myself from the protagonist. And last but not least: The bad guy gets away with burying Rex alive. How insane is that? He drove through three countries with the guy in the car, passed two borders, had stopovers and was even stopped by a police car. And after Rex goes missing nobody has a clue where he went? Having the movie end on that note was a total let-down. It's especially disappointing because the movie refrained from giving the audience a happy ending, which is rare and should be encouraged. But I would have preferred a good happy end to a bad sad ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of "The Vanishing" took be by surprise; unfortunately, because I expected it to be a scary movie. One of the biggest suspense killers is predictability. From the start of the movie I knew line for line what would happen. It didn't help that the movie meandered on at snail speed. Seems as though horror movies focus so hard on a downer ending they forget that it's the unknown, the unsure of what's to come, that scares audiences the most. During the movie they kept putting emphasis on being trapped in closed spaces (the golden eggs, claustrophobia) so it was obvious what the fate would be. On top of this they kept placing vital suspense scenes before character development so it made the latter drag painfully. If you're only scared by shock, fast-forward to the grisly end, otherwise Jeff Bridges' performance in the 1993 version was far more disturbing despite a convenient 'Hollywood' ending.</fullReview>

It seemed quite happy in it's own way.One thing that bugs me though (might be a minor spoiler) is at the end, when Rex snatches the keys from Raymond, Rex starts to walk away with them. Then Raymond pours a drink, makes his final proposition, and STARTS HIS CAR. How? He could have had an extra set, I suppose, but the way it's presented seems more like the writers forgot he took the keys. It is also one of the reasons why I felt like the ending was forced on the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid ending undoes an OK film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard many positive reviews, and was very anxious to see this movie. The beginning, which focuses on the protagonist, Rex and his girlfriend, Saskia, is somewhat annoying (as his girlfriend is a bit of a flake and acts pretty dizty). As you probably know "the vanishing" refers to the abduction of Rex's girlfriend, and this part is pretty good. The actor playing Rex is pretty good and turns in a believable performance as a distraught lover. warning ... spoiler Then the film focuses on the abductor, a man named Raymond. For reasons that are somewhat unclear, he has decided (after saving a woman) that then he has to start killing them. In any case, he is a methodical person and begins to plan out the abduction part carefully, rehearing each step and trying out various means to get women into is car (so he can put them asleep with ether). This part is somewhat interesting, but the guy is apparently so creepy, very few women will get into this car, and so he has a lot of dry runs. major spoiler alert And now we come to the end. Rex, after *3 years* is still obsessed with knowing what happened to his girlfriend. Now this part is just plain stupid. He obviously knows she was killed: apparently he wants to find out how. This is not the thinking of a healthy normal mind. To this end, he puts out posters everywhere, goes on TV, etc, asking for the person to come forward, and Raymond, who has been toying with him to meet for awhile anyways, eventually does confront Rex and promises Rex he can enlighten him as to his girlfriend's fate. A long car ride ensues, and at the end, Raymond gives Rex a drink, and it comes out that there is a sedative in the drink. Raymond tells Rex the only way he will "show" him what happened to Saskia is if Rex goes through the same thing she went through. In other words, it is *very* plain that he is going to murder Rex too. And what does Rex do? He drinks it and wakes up in a pine box buried six feet under. I am sorry, but the stupidity of the ending simply vitiates the majority of good work that went into the majority of the film. All in all, it is not a bad film and the ending is quite terrifying (the feeling Rex has in the casket is very realistic), but still a big disappointment.

		<fullReview>I read the comments regarding this movie and rented it. I enjoyed the movie but you would think based on the comments here that this is a landmark in filmmaking. It isn't. It's nothing that Hitchcock hasn't done. Heck, it's nothing that Tales of The Crypt hasn't done. The so-called un-Hollywood ending was the most non-shocking ending ever.One of the main problems of European movies, and this one is no exception, is they take themselves too seriously. They try to imbue themselves with a larger meaning than they deserve. The dialogue between the psychopath and the victim was unreal and bordering on comical. It should have been cut in editing but Europeans love hearing directors pontificate for no particular reason other than to give them the pseudo-intellectual satisfaction of seeing a work of self-professed work of art.Most of the people on this site lauding the movie are Europeans are Americans who fancy themselves as the cultural elite. Fine. I understand that. But it doesn't make this film any better than it is.I don't think I'd be in a rush to see this movie any time soon which is how I ultimately judge movies. I'd give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got interested in viewing "classic" films, and according to the reviews I'd read of this movie, it was supposed to be quite an unpredictable thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. Perhaps I'm a little jaded or something, but I was so disappointed with this film I was sure I'd rented the wrong one. There was no suspense, the ending was predictable, and I was left feeling very let down. So much for a "classic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoorloos Must be Dutch for "Tedious"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly tedious and predictable film in which the only person who can't see the obvious ending is the lead character. This is understandable, in that he proves by the end of the film to be one of the stupidest men to have ever walked the face of the earth.SPOILER If a man who had confessed to you that he kidnapped your girlfriend told you that if you allowed him to knock you unconscious, and that afterward he would do to you exactly what he did to your girlfriend who had vanished without a trace three years before... would YOU let him knock you unconscious?No, of course you wouldn't. You would have to be a complete idiot.The lead character has no such qualms, however.More than not being very bright, the lead character elicits no sympathy from the viewer. Early in the movie we see him to be selfish to the point of leaving his girlfriend in a dangerous situation. He later shows no sympathy for his second girlfriend, Lieneke's, feelings for him. He is, above all, quite a jerk. So the film fails from this angle.Also from the earliest part of the film we know who the killer is. There is no suspense in this. The ending of the movie is thus inevitable, despite it's casual treatment of the question of fate vs. free will.The killer tells us beforehand, at every opportunity, what he's going to do next. There's no mystery here, no suspense, only a constant telegraphing of every potential blow. Nor is the killer, the subject of this "psychological thriller," a very complex character. Nothing is hidden from plain view. The whole film takes on a very one-dimensional feel because of it.Add to the poor job of character creation and the unsympathetic characters themselves the rather clumsy way in which a steady stream of flashbacks are handled and you have, in the end, a very tedious movie, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but too disturbing for most viewers....including myself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very well made and kept my interest throughout. However, when it was finished, I almost wished I hadn't watched it, as the conclusion was EXTREMELY disturbing. I was pretty much expecting an ending rather like this, but still it left me feeling very unsettled.This movie is about a man and his girlfriend. They stop at a rest stop, but she never returns. Years pass and he is obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Finally, after going to the media about this, he is contacted by a man who says he can solve this mystery----provided he do EXACTLY what he tells him to do and does not question ANYTHING he has him do.So, do I recommend you watch it? Well, if you are faint of heart or a child, no. Otherwise, watch it but be forewarned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man's wife mysteriously disappears at a gas station in France, and the man obsessively searches for her for years, led on by the psychopath who took her in a cat and mouse game. Nicely photographed in color but with actors going a bit overboard while obviously trying to be "realistic". Some very good scenes, but the ending fails to pay off on all the suspense that has been gradually built up, and is more sad instead of terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex but unsatisfying story of the search for a psychopathic killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly an interesting study of a psychopathic killer and of the man who sets out to track him down after his fiance disappears mysteriously at a gasoline stop in France. It is known in the English speaking world as THE VANISHING and was remade in 1993 with an American cast. Without revealing the startling denouement, one cannot explain the most attractive aspects of the film, which is the detailed study of both tracker and killer that occupies most of the last half. The unsatisfying part is that while we see many details of these two men's lives, we are given little insight into their motivations. We have to "piece it out" for ourselves. That's probably what the director wanted. Madness and curiosity are obvious motivations, but not really enough. With these cavils, I will still say that SPOORLOOS is at once terrifying, gripping,...and, well, amazing. It is well acted but poorly photographed and edited. One suspects the director is of the sort who doesn't regard these things as important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not a Miesterwerke....I would agree tscoco-NY, that the 'film buff' types will fall all over themselves to embrace a film like this one. But with the crap that is churned out by Hollywood who can blame them? And I do enjoy SOME pontification of 'heavy' meaning in Euro films... it is a relief from watching most American stars clearly thinking while in each scene: "Lets see, with the $2.5M Ill get from this picture I can invest in Bonds, buy a condo in Maui, get that Maserrati, blah blah..."I had heard that there was some kind of 'secret' that the abductor and the 1st victim shared, but it went over my head if true. There was no real motivation on the abductors part I could see... The ending was a bit of a let down, having seen it so many times before-Tales of the Crypt, Edgar Allen Poes' The Black Cat, Premature Burial etc.That being said I fell instantly in love with the very lovely Gwen Echaus (Lieneke). If Rex had only done the same, he might still be alive today...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Vanishing" is what gives foreign films a bad name to the masses. It has a great premise, but the execution by George Sluzier turns a potentially intelligent and scary film into a 100 minute snoozefest.The premise is top notch. Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and his girlfriend, Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege) are going to France for a vacation. Their trip is cut short when Saskia vanishes at a gas station without a trace. Rex is obviously devastated, but after three years pass with no sign of her, he still hasn't given up the hope of finding her. This is probably because he is being taunted by the man who kidnapped her.The film gets off to a decent start. The first twenty minutes are littered with effective red herrings and good character building scenes. But once Saskia disappears, the film comes to a dead halt. The film is pretty short, but it seems to take forever. Part of the reason is because director George Sluzier inserts long pauses between the dialogue. Nothing much happens in these instances, and all they did was threaten to put me to sleep.The acting is fine, but none of the actors have much to work with. We understand these characters, but Sluzier spends the middle portion of the movie repeated what we already know about the characters. This is especially irritating because each of the characters traits can be summed up in one word. Even worse, is the pretentious psychobabble that happens at the end. This is a long and extended sequence between the two main characters and should have been the climax of the movie that everything before it built up to. But the movie is lifeless and the movie thinks its being insightful when it's really just stating the obvious.I really hate minimalist movies. They're boring and pretentious. It represents an ego trip for the wannabe hip director to impress critics. Here's a helpful hint: impress both audiences and critics by telling an engaging story about characters we actually care about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a lot out of movie with such a reputation such as SPOORLOOS (known as THE VANISHING in the US). Perhaps then it was my expectations that led to the disappointment I felt by the film's end. There are plenty of things to like, but not enough thrills to really be a great thriller.First the good: A solid cast gives us characters with real depth throughout. They maintained interest for me even when the story took some implausible or uninspired turns. For example, the actors' telling of the content of the dreams they have is much more involving than the content of the dream itself. Dreams can be weird, but usually we notice they are. For a character to put such belief in a purely obvious art-house movie dream concept was a serious flaw in the story. But the actors made their characters' belief credible, so one can still suspend disbelief - it didn't bring the film to a halt even though it should have for me.Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu is absolutely chilling as a man on a bizarre and dangerous journey to understand himself. His part of the story is the most consistent and he's the reason to watch the film, in my opinion. But that brings me to the bad points. His character had so much depth, that I saw where he was going with his intentions. This telegraphed the ending for me; not in detail but certainly in overall outcome. As for Gene Bervoets' character, while again well acted, made too many of those decisions where you just want to talk to the screen and tell the character, "are you stupid?" or "don't do that!". I'm always disappointed whenever the audience knows what to do (or not to do) but the character just ignores all common sense, reasoning, and any information before them, for no reason other than to move the film forward or just make it longer.Perhaps just as bad is the omission of the obvious in a story. SPOORLOOS has a curious ambiguity with regard to law enforcement's roll in the film's events that Hitchcock would never have overlooked. I can't elaborate without revealing things, but I wonder which is worse: when police don't show up at all in a thriller, or when they show up only at convenient plot points.So while I found the first half of the film interesting and the characters engaging for the most part, SPOORLOOS fell way short of its reputation. I won't say it's entirely predictable, just a lot more than it should have been. I was annoyed that while credits rolled, I could come up with better ways to resolve the story.That left me with a few questions, two of which are: is a suspense film really suspenseful when you can figure out the ending 20-30 minutes before it happens? How much of a thriller has to be thrilling to be a good one? Maybe this is more about what a viewer expects, and what they've seen before. Perhaps it was better when it came out (but there's still the comparisons to Hitchcock and how much better he could craft this type of thriller). I've seen much worse, and it's certainly not a waste of time. But personally, I'm at a loss for why this film is rated so highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently a lot of people think the revelation at the end of this film is worth the trip to get there. I am not one of them. (Don't worry; I won't be giving anything away.)I don't think the comparison which has been made to Hitchcock is apt at all. Hitchcock normally puts you on a slow boil, then raises the temperature until by the end you're scorching and sticking to the bottom of the pot (maybe I took that analogy too far). There is a lot to keep you busy in the typical Hitchcock film, with an exciting finale as a bonus.But in The Vanishing there is so little to hold your interest. By about midway, I was wondering whether the film would end up like The Usual Suspects, where the ending would force the viewer to re-evaluate everything that had gone before. But in that film your attention was held until the twist. In The Vanishing unfortunately, it's an all-or-nothing proposition. The first 100 minutes of the film have no merit of any kind -- they're just setup for the big payoff. And for me the big payoff was in Confederate currency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a stupid ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Mr. Rex Hofman, the main character in this movie, totally mentally retarded and suicidal? Even though Rex is insanely obsessed with the disappearance of his girlfriend, why did he have to give himself up to a psychopathic killer and let himself be tortured to death? What did he accomplish? Absolutely NOTHING!! Unless a person is a psychopathic masochist, no human being in this world will ever do such a stupid thing!! Apparently Mr. Hofman is indeed a totally stupid, psychopathic masochist. I cannot buy the existence of such an idiotic individual on this planet, except in an insane asylum. Some IMDb commentators have complimented this movie as a good character study of a psychopathic killer. No, no. This movie is a character study of two psychopathic killers: wacko Monsieur Raymond, who kills others, and stupid Mr. Rex, who seems to enjoy killing himself. When a movie deviates from reality to this extent, it stinks. This is a rotten mackerel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vanishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like it when I find a film that was listed in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and then I recognise a part of it either by discussions or clips I have seen, and this Dutch/French film did exactly that. Basically Dutch couple Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna Ter Steege) from Amsterdam are on holiday in France, while driving they run out of fuel and stop at a petrol station, Saskia enters the station store to buy drinks, unknowingly observed by mysterious Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), Rex realises she is missing and frantically searches for her. Through flashbacks we see that Raymond is respectable family man with a wife and two daughters, he had been secretly plotting an abduction a woman for some time, buying an isolating house, testing chloroform and rehearsing scenarios, his initial attempts at actually doing it were unsuccessful, he decided to pose as an injured motorist needing assistance to lure a woman into his car, and this is how he caught Saskia. Three years have passed since Saskia disappeared, and Rex is still determined to find her, during this time he has received postcards five times to meet the kidnapper at a café in Nimes, but each time the kidnapper did not show up, unknown to Rex the café is close to Raymond's apartment. Rex has a new girlfriend, Lieneke (Gwen Eckhaus) who is reluctantly helping him in his search, she is slowly become dissatisfied with their relationship as he clearly still cared for the missing Saskia, and eventually she becomes frustrated with his obsession with her and leaves him, he decides to make others aware of his search by appearing on television, he says he only wants to know what happened to her. Raymond sees his television appearance and is fascinated by Rex's fanatical search, so he decides to confront him and admits that he kidnapped her, but he will reveal what happened to Saskia if he comes with him, he describes himself as a sociopath, he previously was seen by his daughter as a hero having saved a drowning girl from a river, so he became obsessed seeing if he could commit an ultimately evil act, having committing one of great good. He tells that he kidnapped Saskia from the petrol station posing as a travelling salesman, she was enticed into his car when he offers to sell her a gift she wishes to buy for Rex, then of course he uses the chloroform to knock her out, and that is when he drove away and she disappeared, but he will not reveal what he has done with her. Raymond tells Rex that even he was to go to the police, which he threatens to do, there is no evidence to connect him to the crime, he then pours Rex a cup of coffee, which has been drugged, he explains while Rex is raging and before he starts to go unconscious that the only way he will find out what happened to Saskia is to experience it himself. The end sees Rex wake up, he is horrified to find himself trapped inside a coffin, he has been buried alive, while above ground Raymond is relaxing at his country home reading the newspaper that reports Rex disappearing along with Saskia, their photos are side by side in egg shapes, resembling a dream Saskia described, this indicates a premonition of sorts. Also starring Bernadette Le Saché as Simone Lemorne, Tania Latarjet as Denise, Lucille Glenn as Gabrielle and Roger Souza as Manager. Bervoets as the obsessively searching boyfriend does well, and Steege with her time on screen convinces being the vulnerable victim, but the film is definitely most worthwhile for the performance of Donnadieu, one of the most chilling, narcissistic and devious psychopathic, the story certainly draws you in to the mystery, seeing where it goes next, and of course when it comes to the shocking ending you really know how evil the villain is, well, that is what he wanted to become, a, interesting and terrific psychological thriller. It was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers aplenty!sure this film has a great twist ending, which no matter what you will not expect. I knew the ending was supposed to be pretty disturbing, but not what it was.Anyways, i have to say this movie pretty much failed with me for only one reason. The bad guy was way more sympathetic than the good guy. It was hard to feel any sort of dread coming into the final scenes. We knew he kidnapped Saskia, but the scenes featuring his planning of said kidnapping was just way too funny. It almost seemed like an episode of america's dumbest criminals or some other fox crap. and then the good guy acts like such a jerk most of the time that I really had a hard time feeling bad for him. I mean i wouldn't have been suprised if we find out saskia had just decided to leave him.And the ending was somewhat of a letdown. I was glad to see the old be careful what you wish for deal, but I really was suspecting something completely over the top. Like that old urban legend where the wife disappears on the honeymoon and is found years later horribly disfigured working in a freak show. Or something. It was just too downbeat, but then again the ending was suprising, and that was good too i supose.Oh well. If you are a fan of horror movies, do not buy into the thought that this is a nail biting suspense movie that will disturb you as many proclaim. You've probably seen it all already. But for the easily shocked, or fans of tame art cinema, or people who enjoy watching agatha christie movies, this will probably be a really disturbing movie.6 out of 10</fullReview>

And that comes with just a few minutes left in a long tedious film.The scenes where Lemorne is unsuccessful in kidnapping build no particular tension and could come from any B movie.Sure the girl is a kidnapped and something happened. But who could be so insipid and dimwitted as boyfriend Rex Hofman? We are asked to believe that three years later Rex allowed the known killer to knowingly drug him and do him in too. Please, that premise is pedestrian, trite and distressingly shallow.</fullReview>

It is unfortunately about as exiting as crossing Germany in its full length from north to south on the motorways as this is a chatty film where most of the time is spend in a car. The dialogue isn't interesting enough to keep up interest and little else is going on in this film. Highly overrated and eventually depressing, motorways just aren't that interesting and neither is the unhappy ending.

		<fullReview>I read other comments on the movie, after first having seen the American version (The Vanishing, with Jeff Bridges). The comments about the ending being superior in this, the original version, being superior to the remake, were what intrigued me. Let me tell you that I was entirely disappointed that I wasted the time when I could have gone to bed early.The acting was nowhere near as decent as in the remake. Production values were even cheesier. More to the point, the ending sucked. This struck me as one of those instances when people somehow associate the concept of a "film" (the original) with "good", while "movies" (typically Hollywood efforts) as "bad" or "inferior". Definitely a good example of when that isn't the case.Do yourself a favor. Go directly to the Hollywood remake. I was left hoping that the two main 'victims' in this version disappeared so that they could take acting lessons. Better yet, take the putz who played the psycho with them.</fullReview>
