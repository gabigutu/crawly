		<shortDescription>An Epic in every sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word "epic" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A standing ovation for all concerned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of "Smeagol" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for "The Two Towers" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to "The Battle of Helms Deep", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. "Definitive" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings "The Two Towers" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're a fan, that's not about to change.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a "post-viewing" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring "actors" not "stars"; "Oscar-worthy" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of the Three Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge "The Two Towers" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on "Zulu"- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are "some things worth fighting for", when Merry tells Pippin that there "won't be a Shire" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that "the sun has gone down in the West" this film could be entitled not the "Two Towers" but "the Twin Towers". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful. This film left me breathless. I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely. I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum. Gollum gave an astonishing performance. The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring. The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor. For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.On the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening. There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times. Aragorn's performance is outstanding. He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.Gandalf "the White" in this film was a twist. We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard. Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking "leaf" as explained in the novel. There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard. No fireworks, or pipes. Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.Very dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise. Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well. It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping. But the surprise was aimed at Samwise. Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend. Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment. This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.Merry and Pippin's story is very odd initially. The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others. The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience. They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor. Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could. I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent. This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away. There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail The Heroes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though "Final Fantasy" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF "cast" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Fantasy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazg?ls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Paced than the first, the battle for Isengard was excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater. When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops. This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense. The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing. The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes. The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film. To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminder?this is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's "original" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very "literary" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many "festive" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the "literary" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, "LOTR Two Towers" is an excellent movie! A "10" out of "10"!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Visit To The Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained****** SPOILERS ******I was entertained and more , but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn`t automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done , but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson - How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he can`t ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep : Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema , cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat , except they did so mainly off screen . It`s as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .Of course you don`t notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and that`s a lack of an emotional impact . Yes you`ll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won`t burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between , though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor , Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain , and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldn`t help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obviousBut despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits , gasped at the technical achievements , but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely, totally fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir, Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in "Titanic" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of "The Lord of the Rings" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of "The Lord of the Rings" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of "The Lord of the Rings" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: "Gollum" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor, Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in "The Two Towers"; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The "olyphants" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs, wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that "The Lord of the Rings" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomore effort shines as brightly as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Fellowship, the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story, including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship, while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture, in full view not shadow, and is a triumph to behold.The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered, without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns, much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears, and Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.There are many great moments, from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue, Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam, as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new, and sometimes strange, allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents, innocents are killed, and destruction abounds. At the same time, strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths, as all seems lost; and then your heart soars, as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.This is not a sequel, it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such, it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat, as darkness looms, while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Imaginable Second Chapter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For this movie, Peter Jackson was faced with a challenge: how to make a great stand-alone film when the beginning and ending are in separate movies? He did a magnificent job. Like the first one, this movie starts with a slam-bang battle; however, where the first film had armies, this film has a clash between two titans.From there, the movie builds to the enormous set-piece siege. And, along the way, we meet one of the most interesting characters of this, or any movie: Gollum, the complex, torn, schitzophrenic slave to the will of the One Ring.And, even more than the first film, the Ring is also a character: the viewer can see it wearing down Frodo, pushing him to the limit, tempting those around him. The encounter at Osgiliath, while not in the book, is a fascinating visual realization of more subtle themes in the book. I know that, when I walked out of the theatre, I knew that there was only one movie I was looking forward to during the next year, and that was Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story - and the heightism - continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ? a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Magical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.One hallmark of science fiction and fantasy is the creation of a world that includes to some extent the creator. That way, instead of inhabitants bumping around in a world, we get a complex set of interactions: some as a result of the world affecting the players, and some the other way around. Tolkien's work fits well within this tradition, in fact why it was so successful I think is the thoroughness with which he developed the magical laws. The reader not only understood that the magic had power, but had some notion of how it worked. That allowed the reader to exist both at the level of Frodo and the magical level of the wizards and demigods.That's the soul of the books; not any episode, not any `theme' about brotherhood or hope or any such sodapop.The first film of this saga impressed purely with the sheer ambition of the project, and we now have the second one. It is fun watching, just like `Speed' was in its day, but I'm unhappy with some of the choices that were made.With film, there are specific ways to span the two worlds, ways which a few filmmakers have been exploiting for a long time -- long enough for some of them to appear in mainstream films. Almost none of those techniques were used here. Nearly all the choices were ones that plant us firmly in the world of the inhabitants who are buffeted by the world's forces just like we as people are. This literally boils all the magic out of the books, and we are left with `Braveheart' meets `The Black Cauldron' except slightly more expensively done and with some monsters.The travesty is not that these choices were made to protect the investment in the films, but that so many Tolkien enthusiasts miss the point and argue about whether elves appear in the wrong scenes.Further to the philosophy of the film: the manner in which the characters deal with the camera is roughly equivalent to the relationship the readers' imaginative `eye' has with the text. In addition to being cast at the level of the adventures and not the magic, there are other problems. That stance is inconsistent -- the greatest offense comes in the middle of the great battle. Until then, the players have been dead serious. They've been in their lives, not characters in a movie that wink at us. But all of a sudden, we have a barrage of winking: the `surfing' move, the dwarf-tossing joke, the 007-like standoff on the bridge. All of these depend on us knowing it is a movie and the characters leaving their lives and knowingly entering the movie.Other problems with that stance. The various technologies used each have their own way the camera must be used. The two perspectives that impressed me were the handling of the fight between Gandolf and the balrog and the relationship we have with Gollum. In the first, our eye IS magical as it swoops around sometimes watching the fight, sometimes IN the fight. This use of the camera is new -- I noticed it also last week in `Treasure Planet' when encountering the black hole. But it entirely different than the soliloquies Gollum (and several others) have. Under the guise of talking to themselves, they are really talking to us, nearly looking at the camera. All of the camera engagement is from Bergman, and is his well-studied solution to the Shakespearean stage technique.I liked both of these, but they are inconsistent with each other, inconsistent with Tolkien's magic as noted and inconsistent with the movieland jokes. But there are even more diverse perspectives. We have the helicopter shots (again from `Braveheart'), and a few similar shots of virtual sets. We could have had some new movement (like the balrog fight), but we are supposed to recall similar shots.And then there are the Ents, animation straight out of `Poltergeist.' It is another set of views determined by the technology rather the story. Shifting among the bluescreen of hobbits in Ents, to the humanistic CGI Gollum, to the video game animation of the battle was jarring. We never were in Tolkien's world, just browsing through the aisles of your video store, shifting about.LOTR was written with specific notions of reading in mind and is bound to them. But `Dune' was not. Imagine a film of Dune with this budget and Lynch's originality instead of Jackson's `me-too-isms.' Now that would be cool.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual masterpiece and better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.When we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking "tree herder" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.These three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.The pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.Still, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****</fullReview>

This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down. Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn. I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch. But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff? Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience? Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes. This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release. the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.Well, so be it. One or two major missteps in a ten hour movie is not unexpected. On its merits, apart from that, this movie, like the whole trilogy, is a magnificent achievement.One question: every time I look, Legolas is shooting dozens of arrows. And every time I look, his quiver is full. Where are the arrows coming from? Elf magic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where "The Fellowship of the Ring" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment ("The Return of the King"). Many view "The Two Towers" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of "The Fellowship of the Ring", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended, The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.The acting is just as great as the first, and with the addition of new characters, the film's atmosphere has gone from "new and wondrous" to "grim and hopeless". Needless to say, Andy Serkis as Gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. Bernard Hill does a wonderful job as Theoden, as well as Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Karl Urban is a nice choice as Eomer, nephew of the king. Possibly the best of the new characters is Faramir, played by David Wenham. Unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books, this Faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the Ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. The character Treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the CG work on Gollum; both are exquisite.The writing and directing equals The Fellowship of the Ring, in that the continuity remains, never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. The only real flaw, which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to The Return of the King, is the vast expansion of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor, aided by the insidious Gollum. The changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yet, with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film, there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen.Fully seeing the MASSIVE software at work, the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution, as 10,000 Uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. From the Mumakil (elephants) to the Fell Beasts upon which the Ringwraiths ride, we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film.Howard Shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. Equaling The Fellowship of the Ring, the music for The Two Towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the theme of Rohan to the thundering might of Isengard, The Two Towers is full of rousing composition. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the Ents.Overall, while different from the text in terms of time-line, The Two Towers is an extraordinary sequel to a "trilogy" destined for greatness. While the film ends before the events in Shelob's tunnel, there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come. One must see this film.</fullReview>

Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel.This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect. And isn't afraid to use them. The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding. The scene's with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river. The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo. The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time. All in all, this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough to put on film but came out very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is "brooding". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for "epic battle sequences" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.4/4. Wish I'd seen it in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a definite step down from part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.spoilers followFor example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). It is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable "artistic license".As an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced WW2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. Wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of what is ultimately the best trilogy of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second installment, great DVD, story a bit muddled, a movie mainly for "Ring" fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary..."As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the "Ringheads" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. "I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the "Ringheads" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a joy to watch. Just too long and boring in spots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of 2002!!!! Another masterpiece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!! You better go see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the "yes, I have read the books" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as "they left out too much", "its not what I imagined" or "Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was shorter than expected but still awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle scenes were awesome but the plot was a little shorter than expected and it is more choppier than the 1st and 3rd Lord of the Rings (LOTR). I loved it when Legolas, Orlando Bloom, went on that shield like a skateboard. It was cool. Does any of you recognize Elrond from another movie? Let me give you a hint. "Mr. Anderson!" Do you know now? For those who do not know, it is Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving from the Matrix trilogy. Other famous LOTR actors are Sauroman, Christopher Lee, in the Star Wars Episode 2, and Gandalf, Ian McKellan, plays in X-Men as Magneto. Besides Christopher Lee, you notice that some of the good guys play bad guys in other movies. Weird huh? There are others but it is too many to list.The extended version of the Two Towers is way better than the theatrical. It explains why Eomer gets kicked out in more detail. Also it explains more about Faramir, Bormir's brother, and their father. Gandalf explain more about his rank and what is going to happen next when he returned to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili. I thought that the Gollum singer was little jazzy for LOTR. I liked Enya better because she has such a beautiful voice.In the book, LOTR creatures, such as the eagles, shadow fax, the spider, and so on talked in the story. I guess Jackson want to make the movie more realistic than book. They did a great job on Gollum. The actor had some special juice he drink for that voice. He explains in the special features. I really like the fact that Tolkien made his own language out of a bunch other languages and name it elvish.I think if you really watch and maybe read the trilogy, you might learn something out of it. I'm not saying you should but I would recommend it. If you like computer games, I would recommend Age of Wonders because it is a strategy game which has characters similar to the LOTR. But be careful, it can be addictive and you might find yourself playing for several hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compromised vision.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed this movie I have a few gripes. Why did they decide to stray from a good thing. I have noticed alot of the "excellent" &amp; "best movie ever" comments are from people who have not read the books.As far as I recall Frodo and Sam did not go to Gondor. EVER. Please correct me if I am wrong.Also what is going on with Aragorn's storyline? It also seems to have been creatively altered from the original storyline.And when did Faramir turn evil. He was not like his brother. He didn't want to use the Ring as they portray in the movie.I realize that the fight scenes were important to the creators of the movie. However did they need to be quite so long? With just a few minutes of cutting and leaving out the "never actually happened" Gondor trip. I believe they could have actually fit in the entire book. I now wonder how long the third movie will be. Not only do they have to fit in the entire third book, but also the end of the second book.For those of you who thought this was the best movie ever I just suggest you read the book. I too liked the movie, but it is not the best ever. It would have been in contention if they had stuck to the original plot as it was written. Like they did in the first movie. However they didn't and that is that. I just hope they stay truer to the storyline in The Return of the King. We shall soon see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - but far from perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film. It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production. That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows. Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into. You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.Anyway. CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right. Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer. I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime. CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?). Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done. However, the artists could have done with actually "looking" at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film. Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&amp;Dragons this isn't much to brag about. However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable. Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly "Dragonlance Chronicles" (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.It's an 8. But only because I have an odd taste in movies admittedly, which would put Spaceballs as a 10. I apologise in advance for this travesty of judgement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people who vote against this movie or didn't see it, or just hate it for hatred. This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with "political" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent addition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as they want you to think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Since I have read the books once, my review will of course be weighted somewhat by that.First, let me try to see the movie as a new film, no preferences, just another movie. It is nearly 3 hours long, a format very hard to master. You have to keep the viewer interested at all time not to let him/her fall asleep. This is mainly done by effects in this movie, which I think is not enough. The plot does not contain the sufficient amount of suspense, nor does the music. The plot vanishes in monumental 20 minutes scenes just saying: "There was a fight" or "He is the bad guy". Scenes like that are just there to restate something that was even too obvious the first time it was shown. Accompanied by an equally monumental musical score this constant insulting of your intelligence just makes your mind go numb. Peter Jackson could have said all this movie says in one hour instead of three, if he was a good director. A film is only as good as it's story.Some things are of course good. The casting is great (with some exceptions), the acting is as good as one can expect, the scenery is good (OK, the barren waste since a thousand years is a lush forest, but who cares? I don't) and the special effects are marvelous and incredible. Sadly, that's all there is to it. I really wanted this trilogy to be the best, the greatest films ever created. I hoped that the second part would be better than the far from perfect first movie, but I got brutally let down. Beneath the crust of pure eye candy this is a hollow void.The conclusion is: Go see this movie, but don't expect anything but a nice computer demo. The animators deserve the credits, the "director" should be ashamed.Corrolary: Since Peter Jackson has written his own plot I would like to state some of the major differences. People saying that the books are just good vs. evil have probably never read them.Warning, some plot spoiling ahead!!! (I think someone else already spoiled it, but ok)An example of polarization of good-evil: The ambitious fellow Saruman believes he can beat Sauron and thus save Middleearth if he gets hold of the one ring (and he probably could). He is not evil, he has his own way of seeing things.This is reduced to him being the all evil lackey of the all evil Sauron.An example of how the importance of CHANCE is ripped away:Pippin (I think) by curiosity uses the palantir when it is by chance aimed at Mordor and sees Sauron who ask: "Who are you?" Pippin answers: "A hobbit" before he is interrupted by his friends. This event leads Sauron to the (erroneous) conclusion that Saruman has the ring. Why? Since it is very painful to use the palantir, none of the good guys would do it to a hobbit, ergo Saruman made him do it. Ergo, Saruman wants to show Sauron that he has the hobbit i. e. the ringbearer and the ring. Sauron thinks Saruman has the ring and acts according to that, which is the only reason he empties Mordor of troops. If the alliance has the ring an attack is possible. Aragorn is also using the palantir in a somewhat taunting way to enhance this. In doing this Sauron opened the only possibility for Frodo and Sam to reach mt. Doom without getting caught by patrols. When he realize that the ring is in Mordor, it is too late. All this due to a little hobbits curiosity, a factor Sauron didn't and couldn't take into account.In the films this simply isn't. Everything is deterministic. Everything is planned and thought of, thus actually making it impossible for Sauron to lose.More examples could easily be stated. However, I only considered things that are greatly contradictory to the spirit of the books, not actual plot misses which are numerous./The disappointed storyliner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though many would say that The Two Towers was excellent and some would say brilliant, I have different opinions. I have seen this movie four times, and each time, my opinon changes. The first time I saw it, I had no idea what was happening, so I basically slept for three hours. However, the second time I went, I went with a Lord of the Rings fan who was explaining the story to me nonstop. It was better that time, but still not that good. The third time I understood it completely, but the fourth time I got bored of it. I think it would have been a better movie if it was a little easier to understand. Most people enjoy these movies because they have read the books, but the producers have to realize that some of us don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Peter. Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a LOTR fan, but I nearly walked out of this movie. The acting was good and the scenes were well choreographed, but the plot failed to flow. This move ignored the book it was supposed to be about. The timelines in the book were ignored; the character development for new characters (such as Faramir) was bastardised and ruined for 'dramatic purposes'; scenes were added that did not exist in the book. I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as Frodo's saviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this time made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while watching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without any sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the action to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot. The action was good, but the gaps in the plot made it hard to follow. This WAS 3 hours of my life I will never be able to get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After falling asleep watching The Fellowship I decided to give the two towers a chance.It sadly is more of the same unimaginative black and white world depiction like the Fellowship. There are only 2 kinds of people, the good guys and the bad guys in the Lord of the rings movies.The good guys look nice, fresh, heroic and smart. The bad guys have hideous faces, wear old clothes, are conniving and not too bright. In the two towers Frodo continues his way to Mordor to destroy the ring. This time accompanied and guided by Gollum, some CGI created creature. Again they walk an awful lot and encounter some danger which they narrowly manage to avoid. At the end of the movie though, they still haven't managed to make it so well need a 3rd movie to find out if Frodo will succeed. I have a strange feeling that he just might.The 2 captured Hobbits escape and seek refuge in a walking tree. I've been told they spend 58 hours per frame to make it look real. To me it looked straight out of Sesamestreet and i had trouble not to laugh.Suddenly Gandalf appears out of nowhere and wasn't killed after all in his demon battling in film number 1. Ahh, what a shame. You really cant believe anything in this movie. After some bickering in the land of horsemen we see a huge battle between the (300) good guys and the (10000) bad guys. Off course, the good guys win. How surprising. By then I finally dozed off into a deep sleep whilst knowing this is a perfect film for children aged 3 to 10. It wasn't as bad as The Fellowship but it was still waaaaaaaaaaaaay too predictable and simplistic. I didn't give it a 1 but a 3 because I did like the cinematography and the locations where nicely chosen.</fullReview>

There are very few director's that revolutionize Hollywood, but I say Peter is one of the best!!! He portrayed everything with amazing visual effects, the huge armies and epic battles! Treebeard is sweet! He is so treelike and was well done, like the picture in my head! This movie has no flaws, and is one of the best! Definitely this trilogy is the greatest epic of all time!

		<shortDescription>The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got "ambiguity" and "unreliability" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his "preccciousssss" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, Action-Packed, Eye-Popping Second Film In The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from The Fellowship Of The Ring, JRR Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings saga continues as hobbits Frodo and Sam, in the company of the devious Gollum, continue their quest to destroy the One Ring, Aragorn and his friends fight to protect the people of Rohan from the evil Saruman's vast army of orcs and kidnapees Merry and Pippin escape from their captors and befriend the Ents of Fangorn Forest.This beautiful and breathtaking fantasy film's only flaw is that being the middle book of a trilogy it doesn't have a beginning or an end. That aside, it maintains the stunning high quality of the previous film in every aspect of production and keeps the epic story sweeping along at a magnificent pace. The performances are uniformly excellent but three actors new for this movie in particular distinguish themselves. Hill as the proud but miserably oppressed King Theoden. Dourif as the slimy Grima Wormtongue. There's a wonderful moment where he says to Lee, "But we'd need an enormous army for that !!", to which Lee strides to a balcony and looks down at a colossal orc army amassed outside. And in particular Serkis, who never appears on screen (Gollum is computer-generated) but performed on set, motion-captured the character's moves and provided his incredible voice. For me, Gollum is the key character in the movie and he is brilliantly realised, bursting with pathos, rancorous bile and schizophrenic nuttiness ("We hates Bagginses !! We hates them forever !!"). Howard Shore's excellent score and the outstanding effects work by Richard Taylor, Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook (the battle for Helm's Deep setpiece especially is a stunning composite of live-action and effects) serve to make this film even more spectacular than its predecessor. This is a movie with too many great scenes to mention, and tells a classic story with incredible visual splendour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. "Impossible", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century."The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt," admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, I personally think that this movie is inspirational. It shows how far someone can/has to go to achieve there goals. It shows that you have to fight for what you believe in, and make a commitment. Also, friendship is a big factor in this movie. Sam is willing to risk his life to help Frodo, and expects nothing in return. For me, that was very devoting. LOTR shows that once you start, you can't just give up. You have to work to get what you want, and you have to embrace your future. And to me that is very inspiring. It also teaches you to be happy with what you have....don't be selfish. This movie has changed my outlook on life, and I think it had changed me as a person.Not to mention that pretty much everone in the movie is a total stud! That helps a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers was my favorite, but it is as good as the prequel. Peter Jackson won his major triumph again! The thing about the Two Towers is that, it makes everyone wondered what was going to happen, the fellowship was broken and the dark lord is winning over middle-earth.The Two Towers explained the path of the hobbits and the king. The film follows its prequel as did the book as Frodo and Sam make their way towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring of evil. They encounter a new creature called Gollum that is bound to the ring, and claims he knows the route into Mordor. Is he a friend or foe?it then shifts to Merry and Pippin who are held captive by a band of Uruk-hai. the Uruk-hair get destroyed in a battle against humans, and Merry and Pippin flee into the forest of fangorn. There they meet the most beloved character in The lord of the Rings books, treebeard, a creature that is a walking, talking tree that must gather the other trees for an inevitable battle against Saruman. And lastly, there's Aragorn, and his two friends Gimili, a dwarf, and Legolas, an elf. They follow the Uruk-hai, till the damned creatures meet their miserable fate. The trio encounter a band of human riders from a country called Rohan, which tell them the direction of the uruk slaughter, which leads the trio into Fnagorn forest, where they meet an unexpected friend, and learn that the folk of Rohan are being attacked by Saruman, and must make a stand against an army of 10,000! Can these three gatherers change the fate of middle-earth in the little time they have? Peter Jackson has proved himself of filming great battle sequences, unique special effects, a great storyline of an unforgettable tale, and moral lessons all people must learn. 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended Edition is definitive Tolkien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved Tolkien's masterpiece since I was 10 years old. I bought the calendars by Brothers Hildebrandt all through college, and I have eagerly awaited the movies since they were announced some four years ago. I just saw the Extended "Two Towers" last night at the Seattle Cinerama, and I was absolutely stunned by how improved it is over the earlier edit (which I saw three times in theatres). As good as "Fellowship" is, I feel that the restored "Two Towers" blows it away.  ****** SPOILERS ****** So many things that felt half-finished in "TTT" now contribute to the richness of detail that makes this such an epic. The stable scene with Brego, Aragorn, and Eowyn is pivotal in setting up several later scenes. The migration of the trees of Fangorn to Helm's Deep, the flashback to Boromir in Osgiliath, and Theodred's funeral all serve to bring the story much more in line with Tolkien's vision. Even the raiding of the stores by Merry and Pippin is wonderful, injecting some of the lightheartedness of "Fellowship" into what is a much darker story. ****** END SPOILERS ****** This trilogy will stand as a singular achievement in cinema history. In an era when many big-budget films are mindless, sadistic two-hour pageants of explosions and gunplay, it is remarkable that these films were made at all, let alone with such faithfulness to very complex source material. Bravo to New Line, Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, the entire crew, and of course the magnificent cast, especially Ian McKellen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, this is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema ever committed to film. From the very first moment the direction and action grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until long after you've left the cinema. The film's epic proportions and feel as well as it's intense emotion are perfectly controlled by one of the greatest director's that cinema has ever seen. As an adaptation it's not without it's flaws, leaving many of us -who've read Tolkien's novel- with questions still unanswered, even having watched the special extended edition. Yet, over all, the changes made and omissions from the book are used to good effect in the exciting retelling of this chapter of the classic tale.Superlative acting from a perfectly cast body of actors adds to the magic of this already classic film. A score to die for and Jackson's sweeping direction create a world that is utterly involving and even believable. 'The Two Towers' is unparalleled in cinema history -except, of course, by it's predecessor 'The Fellowship Of The Ring'- and sets new standards in film effects and story telling. The film is a cinematic journey of rich emotion and spectacular action which can not be praised highly enough. Of course, it does have it's faults in storytelling and even the odd CGI shot, but these pale in comparison to the depth and magnitude of the overall picture.Unlike some recent film successes, 'The Two Towers' rightly deserves it's place among any list or collection of cinema's greatest films. Only the most threatened critic or hardened cynic could fail to be moved by this stunning movie creation. Sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement. As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever. However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short. Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players. We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures. Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's more intimate look at the characters. This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement. WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them. They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.Bottom Line:10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...not as good as Fellowship. Loved Smeagol - more expressive than most of the human actors in the film. But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?Also, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.But, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps. I expected Huey Lewis and the News to kick in.That aside, I will watch the DVD over and over but I'm hoping the extended version, as with Fellowship of the Ring, will iron out the pacing problems and give us more character study to balance the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 2nd part to a trilogy ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9 out of 10 (Like its predecesor, LOTRTT gets a little windy in places)Discounting the StarWars trilogy (forever tarnished by the crap that Lucas is making now), this film is the BEST 2nd installment of a trilogy I have ever seen. It really makes me believe that filming all 3 at once was indeed the only way to do this trilogy.Jackson takes some liberties, but all in all the film is a success on several levels. Characters are maintained and strengthened, The plotting does well not to be too dreadful without inserting lightheartedness or breathtaking action, and the special effects absolutely blew me out of the water.To all the Star Wars fans out there, take a look at Gollum, and see Yoda could only hope to be. Gollum is so life like and well portrayed.All in all a great movie, albiet with some minor flaws,... very minor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A FANTASTIC FANTASY FILM! THE BEST PICTURE OF 2002!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>im not one to like fantasy...i liked the first LOTR movie, but i wasnt crazy about it. i thought it was an ok fantasy film. then comes "The LORD of the RINGS: The Two Towers". it such a great improvement over the first and probably the best sequel ever thats better and more fulfilling then the original. "TTT" got robbed at the oscars: peter jackson deserved best director and this movie deserved BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR!. hopefully next year, both peter jackson and return of the king will finally win the oscars they rightfully deserved. as claudia puig from usa today said..."THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS' is among the most breathtaking achievements in recent cinematic history" i agree. "ttt" stands above every movie in 2002 and is certainly THE VERY BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR AND THE BEST FANTASY FILM TO EVER MAKE IT TO THE BIG SCREEN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You Peter Jackson. These films are absolutely magical. The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie. I looked at some of those who post to slam this film. One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like. I suppose the irony was lost on that one. I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem. I love this film, but I have only seen it once.So do you see... this is a great movie. Even those who hate it can't look away. Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece, despite what Tolkien purists may say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading over some of the IMDb comments on this film, I am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book. Film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible. Tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as I have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie. Jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle. Almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'The Godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Bridge On The River Kwai', 'Apocalypse Now', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Raging Bull' and 2001. And yes, I have read all these books so don't doubt me when I say it. Literary structure is different from the structure of movies. And any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie. So the ending was changed. It will be in the next one. So Arwen's appearance was an invention of Jackson's. It created a bridge in her character between the first and third films. Okay, I can understand the argument about Gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way. In no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when I hear such comments as 'Like Merry And Pippin would ever let Frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', I get really bothered. Menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled Tolkien purists, many of whom I feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly. The smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else. I myself have read 'The Lord Of The Rings' about 6 or 7 times, and I agree it is a great book. Yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way. And I apologize to any Tolkien fans I am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado I must say that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is Tolkien the greatest writer. His mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning. I shake my head when I hear 'The Lord Of The Rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. Despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to Joyce's 'Ulysses', Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov', or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'. I love Dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'The Brothers Karamazov', and 'The Grand Inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, I would not damn the director, and insult the film, for I realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray. If I may parody a line from 'Inherit The Wind', The Lord Of The Rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Fellowship' and was eagerly awaiting the release of 'two towers'. I have never read the books but was informed that the 'Two Towers' would be even better than it's predecessor as the plot thickens and action really gets going. However, on leaving the cinema after watching this film I was left somewhat disappointed.I have read review after review saying this is peoples favourite film. I mean come on, be serious. It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.The creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories. One thing is for sure, I will not look forward to the next sequel as much as I did this one, following this film's disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was brimful of excitement and expectation prior to the release of The Two Towers. After thoroughly enjoying Fellowship I was told this installment would be even better as there is more action in this book than the first (I have never read the books). However I left the cinema after this film immensely disappointed. I have read review after review of Two Towers with people saying this is the best film ever. Come on, I mean seriously! Two Towers is incredibly slow and if it wasn't for the climactic Helms Deep battle would be the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first 2 hours of Titanic. Even during this epic battle it is interrupted by the character which personifies the slowness of the rest of the film, Treebeard. The romance, or attempted romance, between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler is so erksome and pointless I wonder if it is included because Liv complained about lack of screen time. There certainly wasn't any need for her character in this film because their romance is distinctly uncaptivating.Golum is created brilliantly and deserved the Oscar for effects but I was glad to see fhis film ignored in the other categories. I won't look forward to Return Of the King as much as this now. Disappointing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: If you're looking for someone to complain about this film, go elsewhere. I LOVE this film. It's the second instalment in the Lord of the Rings franchise, and I truly enjoyed The Fellowship of The Ring, so let's see what I thought.Now Right from the first scene, this film had me. It's extremely entertaining. And from there; the rest of the film did not disappoint. It has spectacular camera work and a quest-like vibe, two traits from The Fellowship of The Ring I loved, and that fits perfectly into the film's atmosphere. But the thing that captivates you the most; is the music. The score is just great.Another thing that they stepped up is the humor. Far more humor, that (magically) doesn't feel forced, something very important in the second (and some-what darker) film. The characters are also touched on far more. We see more of characters that weren't specifically looked into previously, like Gimli and Pippin. All and all, this film is well and truly a worthy sequel to, all be it not better than Fellowship. The battle sequences are extremely entertaining, the characters are highly enjoyable, and you still get everything you love about Lord of The Rings. This is one of my favorite films of all time, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Towers' works on almost every level, except one plot thread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome back to my reviews of the Middle-Earth saga. We've gone on An Unexpected Journey, visited The Desolation of Smaug, witnessed The Battle of the Five Armies, and met The Fellowship of the Ring. Today, we are going to go on our next stop of the Lord of the Rings saga. Fasten your seatbelts, it's time to get hit by a waterfall. Let's enter......The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The Two Towers follows several different plot threads: Sam and Frodo continue their quest to get to Mount Doom, as a creature named Gollum accompanies them; Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas all go in search of the Hobbits, and later head to Edoras in Rohan to assist in battle; Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Urku-hai and later meet a Ent that may help them in their quest.This is probably my least favorite of the three films, let me just tell you that before we begin. Of course, that doesn't mean it's not a good film, it's a fantastic one. It's just I don't like some of the new characters we are introduced to and Merry and Pippin's story isn't that interesting to me. Anyway, let's get on with the review.As usual, the best thing about the film is it's music. The music created by Howard Shore is always welcome, even in the film's most slow areas. The acting is really great too, by all members, but especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. Wood really portrays Frodo's desperation and slow descent into a form of madness due to him being influenced by the ring. Astin really works well with Wood, making Sam more than just a sidekick, but both a rock and friend that Frodo needs in his times of desperation.The special effects are just as good as the previous films, if not better. Treebeard and Gollum are the obvious highlights, and they are created so convincingly that I couldn't really see any issues with them. I recently read that Treebeard was filmed on a green screen, and honestly, I couldn't tell, even when I watched some of the scenes in HD. Magnificent.The cinematography and, well, shots of the film both are done beautifully. Every scene where groups are riding to battle and scenes where we see sweeping shots of landscapes look amazing, and you can tell that Jackson and anybody else working on that part of the film really wanted it to look good. The best example of this, in my opinion, is the first scene right before we get into what happened to Gandalf.The plot works, for the most part. I found the scenes in Rohan to be the most interesting. Like Peter Jackson said, The Two Towers is mainly focused on Aragorn. It's his main story. So, obviously, that was going to be the most interesting and the most focused upon. I also liked Frodo, Sam and Gollum's story. Gollum's internal struggle is made that much harder halfway through the film, when Frodo has to do something that he didn't want to do. I have to wonder, if that hadn't have happened, would Gollum have been more accepting of not leading Frodo and Sam where they end up in Return of the King?I don't know. I did think that the weakest story, and the one that I don't like to watch, is the story with Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard. I like the character of Treebeard, but it doesn't really work for me. It's just so boring, and it's usually cutting away from the more intriguing stories. Less focus on their tale would have worked for me.In conclusion, overall, The Two Towers is a intriguing follow-up to The Fellowship of the Ring. While I had some issues with Merry and Pippin's storyline, the film itself is a action-packed ride and a great lead- up to the grand finale in The Return of the King.10/10. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, all moviegoers were more than eager to continue the first masterpiece of the XXI century. The Two Towers comes with the huge responsibility of maintaining the fascination left by the first movie, introduce more characters and various others having to be even grander. And he does this goal perfectly. Battles unthinkable, many new important events happening, new characters emerge, and even better effects finalized and dramas more pronounced, are just some of what The Two Towers has to offer. In The Two Towers, the journey continues to seek the destruction of the One Ring. Since the outline of the scripts, Peter Jackson knew that adjustments would be interconnected but would own souls. The Two Towers is not exactly a sequel, but the second chapter in the saga of the ring. The main difference we noticed right away when compared to the Company, is the tone of the narrative. The first contained dark environments of Middle-earth, but was predominantly magical, charming and fantastic weather. This is due to a specific reason: it was necessary to introduce the spectator races of beings that inhabit the world created by Tokien, being required to show their worlds that have nothing to dark as the Shire and Rivendell. From gloomy just quick passage in the Prancing Pony inn and of course the long sequences in the mines of Moira. However, the story is not as dark and the main concern is to tell the origin of the ring, to make clear the importance of its destruction, and setting the villains and heroes in the public mind, especially the uninitiated in the original work. Unlike the first in which all of the Company are together and will slowly separating, in The Two Towers director Peter Jackson wisely alternates between the three parallel stories in completely opposite places in the geography of Middle-earth. Still, changes of pace and scenery are beneficial contributing to the advancement of events. Amid the three stories, we enjoying new characters, scenarios filled with visually stunning scenes. The movie starts directly in chapter two of the book since the first chapter of The Two Towers became the last of The Fellowship of the Ring to the first end with a climax better resolved in the script. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas go after the hobbits Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by orcs, and is meeting with Éomer, the Third Marshal of Rohan and nephew of Theoden, King of Rohan. Eomer gives them horses and says that a group of Rohirrim had attacked and destroyed that group of Orcs two days before, and had not found any hobbit among them.Certainly this second chapter is less detailed and faithful in The Fellowship of the Ring. The main changes are in the final stages of the book, but the criticisms lose some strength as some missing parts were filmed, but inserted in the next movie. In The Two Towers, despite the good progress the issue to join in an interesting three parallel stories (Merry and Pippin with the Ents, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf in Rohan; Frodo, Sam and Gollum toward Mordor). Some important parts of the book are missing for insertion into The Return of the King For the sake of pace, high duration and other factors, these choices director Peter Jackson and editor Michael Horton are fully justifiable. Peter Jackson performs over exuberant work. The battle scenes are epic and a pleasure for the eyes. The director uses open shots to show the scale of the epic battle at Helm's Deep, but gives close ups and shows creative camera movements to further enhance the scenes. The momentum built from preparing for battle works fine. It is noticeable tension, hopelessness in the eyes of citizens not warriors, mostly women and children. A desperate struggle for life chances seemingly against thousands of enemies, which is modified until the arrival of Gandalf and its reinforcement of troops. The scene of Gandalf leading warriors gorge below toward the enemy carried out with slow motion is one of the most dazzling film of recent times. The talented director can be seen also at the bottom where the Ents help fight the orcs of Isengard Srauman in, so as the scene of the Marshes and developing the relationship of Sam, Frodo and Gollum.The Two Towers fortunately surpasses the legend that the sequence never surpasses the original, staying here at the same level. The film appealed to critics and audiences, grossing over $ 920 million worldwide, with $ 341 million in the U.S. alone. Some complained that The Fellowship of the Ring had no end, but Jackson was right to leave Boromir's death to the end increasing the emotional side. It would be very strange, a year later, the opening scene is the death that hung from the previous film. At the same time, Jackson gives interim order in this second part, knowing leave everything open for the grand conclusion of the saga in the next chapter. The Two Towers is one of the great films with content and technical working together perfectly, and it serves not only to prepare for the final chapter of the series. It is a film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR TTT Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.Picking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.The story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.As before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.The Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...The Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two hours too much (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as "Star Wars V" or "BTTF 2" and it's as dull as "Star Trek 3". Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, "The Two Towers". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the middle of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this trilogy there is a beginning that sets up the audience for the characters and the plot, then there is a sequel where the characters continue on from where the first leaves off, certain things happen throughout the second one that prepare everyone for the third, and in the third everything comes to an awesome and amazing ending.The Two Towers picks up from where The Fellowship Of The Ring left off. (Spoilers ahead) In the end of the fellowship: Gandalf fell off a ledge after defeating the balrog, Boromir was shot by orc arrows, Merry and Pippin were captured by orcs, Frodo and Sam left and continued on their quest to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli decided to follow the orcs and rescue Merry and Pippin. The two towers basically follows their adventures and shows how Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are all reunited, Merry and Pippin are rescued by the ents after their captors are attacked, and Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum and ask him for help in getting to Mordor.The Two Towers is a much more complicated story, as there is a subplot involving a falling kingdom and their struggle to survive as orcs are trying to destroy them all. The Two towers is another feast to the eyes and imagination just like The Fellowship of the ring. There is a great battle scene in this at the climax of the story, but the battles in Return Of The King make the battle in this movie seem like a brief sprawl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know Peter Jackson, and I've never been to New Zealand, but after the experience of this film, I don't need to.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS is one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, movies ever made.Jackson wisely does not attempt to duplicate the books--that would be artistic suicide because Tolkien's trilogy is unfilmable. Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity. The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell. J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision. Every character is a prototype. Frodo is the hero on a great quest. Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero. Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth. Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same. Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale. The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed. Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.I am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.Bring on The Return of The King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a first rate epic. From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world. From Gollum to Helm's Deep, the special effects are innocent fun and spectular. I think Helm's Deep is unbelievable though. Peter Jackson knows what he's doing. He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real. That's why I think it's unbeliveable. How could this happen? I don't know. But all I care is that at least it's good.The movie will utterly be remembered years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson should have called it "Middle Earth Stories" - It has nothing to do with Tolkien except the names and places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the Two Towers, I was so disappointed that I left the theater resolved not to buy the DVD and to sell my current copy the Fellowship (which I bought in the hope that it would be redeemed by the later movies.) To be fair, my frame of reference for the movie was based entirely on the books, which I have been reading (over and over again) since I was nine. It seems as though Peter Jackson takes some perverse pleasure it making the characters do exactly the opposite of what they did in the books. I understand it is difficult to transport any book to the screen, but Jackson's changes were not even remotely consistent. This... of course... is the heart of my disappointment. Tolkien wrote a story that seemed to peer into another world - not just of fantasy, but a worldview that is in essence pre-modern. Tom Shippey (Journey into Middle Earth) explains it as a reconstruction of the Middle Ages and its psychology - with priorities, duties, and responsibilities appropriate to that era. C.S. Lewis talked about it as a "Discarded Image" that we once knew, but now no longer fully understand. The Lord of the Rings is a fascinating glimpse into a world where honor and virtue (the immaterial world) stands always higher than the temptations of the material world (such as greed, selfishness, pettiness, etc.) Peter Jackson captures none of that. More importantly, his free reconstructions not only confuse the story on the surface level, but also run completely counter to the spirit of the book. Jackson's characters have no concept of higher duties or responsibilities - they are portrayed as weak creatures constantly at struggle with their base emotions (with no room for higher ideals). In fact, this movie was especially dark and pessimistic. True... this may reflect the modern mindset - in fact, it probably mimics it perfectly. The problem is that I love Tolkien precisely because it does not pander to the modern mindset. It speaks of higher things. I have friends who have never read the books who liked the movie, and I suspect that my love of the books has significantly shaded my perspective. Indeed, if viewed completely on its own terms, the movie is probable fine. But... what I find continually disturbing is Jackson's repeated claims that he has remained true to the book - that is an outright lie! I know he does not want to offend the Tolkien fan base (like me), but I find his pleas of innocence to have exactly the opposite effect. He did not stay true to the book, in either its letter or its spirit. It would have been less startling to me if he had simply called it by another name and made no pretense of turning the book into a movie.On an altogether separate, more technical, note; I found the movie to suffer generally from poor direction. I realize this goes against the grain of almost of the critics, but honestly, I have a problem with Jackson's style of directing - this is completely apart from his editorial abuses. Specifically, he does not give the characters time to consider or reflect on the events; the cuts are too quick and unsatisfying. And this is not just a problem with too much material in too short a time - he could have lost the entire sequence with Aragon and Arwen freeing up 30 minutes or more (without any loss to the story). Also, Jackson so desperately wants this to be epics that he throws in giant panoramic scenes - unfortunately, he does so with the frenetic energy he puts into the scene cuts, which means that the scenes are constantly in dizzying movement. A sustained shot would be nice, and might give the viewer a moment or two to take in the context of the events. But alas, Jackson's sweep do not allow you to catch in any details, or even any of the magnitude. This leads me to the final technical complaint; for all the buzz surrounding the special effects, Jackson's team seems unfit for the job. I suspect he is constantly moving the panoramic shots because the scenes would not hold up to closer examinations. Elsewhere, the CGI characters (with the exception of Gollum, who was created and performed very well) were shallow fascimilies. There were several places during the final battle sequences, where I could almost see the blue/green screen overlays. If Jackson wants to create a competitor to ILM, he will be disappointed. The special effects were both unsubtle and immature - they did not blend well into the story, and were, occasionally, simply distracting.Of course, if you have not read the books, these problems are minor and you may well love the movie. If you have read the books - but only so long ago that you can't remember the storyline, then you might like the reunion with old (albeit completely different) characters. If you love the books, their stories, and their message - this movie is probably not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter, what have you done!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was such a disappointment compared to the first one... About EVERYTHING has changed from the book, and it is not for the better, that is for sure. I don't quite know where to begin:- Frodo is made to look like he is totally under the rings spell, and that he does not see the treacherous nature of Gollum. But then suddenly he is himself for two seconds when discussing with Sam whether their adventure will be told in a song or story... WEIRD!- Gollum is just wrong... His eyes are too cute, sort of...looks like a small baby (they are not too beautiful when they are a week or two old, to tell the truth...)- Shadowfax is supposed to be the fairest horse there is; almost supernatural. In the film he is just an average horse, and not even the most beautiful horse of the film... As to Gandalf, he is supposed to look radiant and powerful, almost like a god! But he just looks like an old, tired man...- The elves in Helms Deep...where did that come from!? The elves never came to the rescue in that battle!!!- Faramir is reduced to a copy of his brother, something which really annoys me! And then he brings them to the city with him...?- Poor Gimli is made to be a "JarJar"...he is just this helpless, useless person that we are to laugh at. Yes, he is helpless sometimes, especially when it comes to horses. The thing with Gimli willingly going up on a horse in the film is just wrong; he's terrified of riding horses, and will only do so if he gets to sit with Legolas on his horse.- Aragorn is made too much of a hero; it almost made me sick (And I am a girl!!!)- Why did they have Pippin bite that brooch off his cape instead of letting him try to run away from the orcs before throwing it in the grass, like he did in the book? He doesn't seem so heroic in the film...- Why did they make it look like the Ents were not interested in helping?- There is so much from "Two towers" that is not in the film...I guess it will be coming in the next one, though, so I won't complain too much about that...There are lots of other stuff I could have mentioned here, I am sure, but I will spare you for the rest. The first film was great, but Peter, you disappointed me with this one - I hope you do a better job with number three!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting fantasy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts off where "The Fellowship of the Ring" leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very very good film! Perhaps not as good as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers perhapsFirst of all I'd like to say I love the trilogy as a whole and I don't think it deserves some of the stick it's getting. I mean just because it's popular people get worried that is going to "rise above" or become a supposedly better film among viewers. What a load of rubbish. I hate to break it to you but just because something is new doesn't mean it isn't a classic. These films are as close to a classic as any modern films at the moment. It's not an order to like these films, it's just very annoying that trolls and LOTR "bashers" just give it abuse just because it has a very high rating, won eleven Oscars etc. If you don't like these films you could at least give a reason.Secondly I'd like to say that I feel this was weaker than FOTR and ROTK and it is #12 on my top movie list whereas FOTR is #5 and ROTK is #1. I have many old classics on my list such as The Godfather, Casablanca and Citizen Kane but for overall enjoyment this trilogy is top. I find this not as emotional as the other two. I mean the elf Haldir dies, there is a brief lovely thing with Sam near the end but apart from that not really. The main qualities about these films are that they are emotionally grabbing and feel like real life, which I feel The Two Towers didn't have, but enough of my moaning. Time for the best bits.The Special Effects were absolutely awesome and 10/10 in quality and no I don't think they wrecked the film. People say also that the acting was poor however Ian Mckellen as Gandalf was superb, Sean Astin as always the Sam I imagined and as for Andy Serkis, well he was superb as Gollum. PJ and the team did terrifically well in making the creature Gollum/Smeagol. It was very interesting to see the emotional struggles he has in it. The Costume Design was good too. You always imagined an orc would look like it did. Elijah Wood as Frodo was impressive again, he's going to be a good actor! Orlando Bloom as Legolas has had so much criticism which is underserved as he isn't just a pretty boy. I can't say he deserved an Oscar as he had a smaller part than perhaps Aragorn and Frodo and Gandalf etc. Cinematography was good, the music stunning. The Sound and score superb. I highly recommend you see this film! Although I see the second and third LOTR not really as sequels, this is somewhat a very good sequel when you consider how many poor sequels there are nowadays. There also many Christian Themes and good messages but I won't go into that as it is explained in a book called "A closer look at Lord of the Rings" which I recommend you read.Overall rating-VERY GOOD GO AND SEE AND BE IN FOR A CRACKER OF A FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly scripted, painful to watch and quite a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep my comments short and sweet:1) Terrible dialouge. I lost count of how many times I cringed as lines were spewed forth. See the King of Rohan and the burial mound scene.2) One dimensional characters. See Gimli's painful and never ending "jokes." Jar Jar Binks was given better material and more dignity.3) Schizo order of the scenes. The best example of this mistake takes place during the final battle at Helms Deep. Highly intense moments of fighting would suddenly shift away to Merry and Pippin. Disconcerting and as it was done throughout the film, the pacing was tarnished.4) Plot holes. One glaringly obvious one was when Frodo almost gives up the ring to a Nazgrul and THEN Faramir, who up till then had had the hobbits in chains, lets them go. That and the many others lead one to wonder where the script supervisor was.5) While a bit harder to point out, this film didn't seem to have any "magic." It seemed flat,coarse and underwhelming. For example one thing I rememember while watching "Fellowship" was not wanting the film to end as it was so enthralling. In TT I couldn't wait for the film to FINISH!To sum up, if you're still in Jr. High I'm sure this film will fit your view as being "the best movie of all time" as previous comments have indicated. For the rest of us however this film was pretty wretched. Note - I'm quite a big fan of JR.R. Tolkein's works so my distaste for TT was not due to ignorance. At the same time let me remark that I had no problem with the foreknowledge that a film of the LOTR would necessitate some changes from the books. My criticisms are focused on how shoddily done the film itself was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of the trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books. The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***? out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson vs. Tolkien 0-2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has taken one of the greatest stories ever written and turned it into mindless action. First off, the script is horrid. Where did the genius of Tolkien disappear? The dialogue is cut down and resembles one-liners. The directing is unbelievably bad with constant camera movement making character development impossible. Fast cut scenes are at all times jumping at you from the screen so you never get the time to fully absorb the story, forget about the time to think. And you're not supposed to, there are no layers (they are magically gone, thanks to the decisions of Peter Jackson), what you see is what you get. Continuity and development are sacrificed to create a pill more easily swallowed. It's like a restaurant where they feed you, and if they do it fast enough then maybe you won't notice that the food isn't cooked. This might work with traditional action (because let's face it, we like them because they give us a 90 minute vacation from our brain), but in the case of LOTR it only goes to diminish and destroy a work of art. Probably the worst thing about this movie is the music score (still it's much better than FOTR, as it's less titanic). Anyone with any understanding of music will see how shallow the composition is. It reminds me of composed music used in computer games, poorly directed and lacking depth. Also it keeps blowing what little suspense it has by frequently changing to custom fit each and every scene. Really nice touch this considering that the scenes change without logic. From the midst of the battle of Helmsdeep to Merry and Pippin in a quiet forest. Somebody please explain to Peter how suspense is built. Besides this, the music has nothing to do with "the lord of the rings", it doesn't capture the right atmosphere and it keeps repeating itself. It's just there and it's there all the time, every scene (another poor directing decision. It didn't give FOTR an epic feel and it failed again in TT). Wouldn't it have been nice if the music featured in the television trailer was actually in the movie?In the storyline Jackson has made some unforgivable alterations. Tolkien would weep if he knew. The lord of the rings is mainly about the journey of Frodo, because if he fails then all is lost. This is also the most interesting part of the story because it is symbolic, dark and a psychological struggle. This is why two thirds of the books are about Frodo. In this second movie Jackson has devoted minimum screen time to this most important, atmospheric and perilous journey. In stead he has used countless minutes, not polishing the rest of the actual story (it often feels like it's on fast-forward and in many scenes the emphasis is on all the wrong things), but adding loads of new scenes which have nothing to do with anything. Apart from changing the story he has also changed some of the the characters (why?). Peter Jackson tries so hard to entertain us, deadly afraid that we'll get bored for even a second thus insulting our intelligence. He sets his own trap and blindly walks into it.**SPOILERS** The book is supposed to be dark, hope is supposed to fade and "the two towers" is supposed to end in the mountains of mordor with Frodo poisoned and taken captive by the orcs and Sam stuck in some dark underground maze with the ring and nowhere to go. Instead the movie ends with Sam giving an inspiring speech about those "favorite stories where all seems lost but where you know that the good guys will win in the end", in some idyllic forest far from mordor with a lot of light and sappy music. This sums up what injustice Jackson has done to the LOTR pretty good. **SPOILERS END**But why? Because Peter Jackson isn't the greatest director in the world. And because they wanted to make money and "the lord of the rings" as it is today is making buckets of it. They wanted a brainless action adventure that followed mainstream traditions that even children could pay to see. They wanted to sell Aragorn rangers and Arwen barbies. This I can understand, and if it weren't so the movie would never have been made. Work and a lot of money went into creating the visuals. What I can't understand is independent critics praising it, when clearly the movie is lacking. There's more to an epic than visuals. A darker, more true and intelligent tale would make a great movie, but it wouldn't make a sure box office income. In the end, FOTR and TT aren't that bad if you just look at them as action-adventure movies (specially FOTR). And one very good thing is that more people will now read the books. But they're just not Tolkien. And don't tell me that it doesn't matter, because it does. I was disappointed with both The fellowship of the ring and [specially] The two towers, not because they're so bad, but because they could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part Two: An Examination of Trust, Intention, and Goodness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced ? Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent ? a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity ? Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and ? from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson tries to do too much here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. Sadly I didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons...Firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. If it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap.The film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. It doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? I got the feeling that Jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths.The second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of Gollum - for some reason I felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. Whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while.I was also disappointed that Gandalf and Saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. Although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story I found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often.The final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - Bernard Hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when McKellen and Lee weren't on screen. John Rhys Davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film.The Two Towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but I just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis: The Two Towers is suppose to represent good and evil but the subplots do not interlink very well due to spacing. It opens where Fellowship of the Ring left off within a battle. Frodo and Sam are joined in their quest by a scheming Gollum, which they captured then they continue their quest to destroy the ring. There are tree creatures that are the film's biggest treasure. Then we are given another useless cliffhanger within a huge battle. Director Peter Jackson tenses the action with impressive visual wonders. Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf returns after having apparently died in his battle concluding the first film. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is involved in much combat until nearly meeting his death after a horrendous fall. Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam struggle as keepers of the ring and the deceit as the Gollum attempts to sabotage their friendship. Andy Serkis is the Gollum and his performance is all the better because of what viewers do and don't see with his performance. The special effects are overwhelming and top notch with detailed structure but the film cannot stand alone. Fans of the books may enjoy it, otherwise it is an overrated spectacle with the two towers being the previous film and the next one to which viewing this relies. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was VERY disappointed by this movie when it came out. True, Jackson does a great job in bringing Tolkien's world to life, and the shots are epic. However, as a Tolkien fan, I find the film tantamount to blasphemy.I understand that you have to remove parts of the book to keep the film at reasonable length, and I understand that you need to make adaptations of the story for the screen. What I don't understand is why you take a literal masterpiece and remove most of it just to include a love story that adds nothing, and isn't very romantic even. Apart from the battle of Helm's Deep, almost none of the events are taken from the book, and those that are have been changed beyond recognition.I (re-)read each book prior to watching the movies - bad mistake! If I didn't have the book in such fresh memory when I saw the movie, I might have appreciated it more.Don't watch this movie with the expectation that it's an adaption of The Two Towers. It isn't. The story is rather based on the Aragorn/Arwen story in appendix A to The Return of the King, with "a little" imagination from Jackson. They should have included much more from the book and made this story a movie on its own.A love story staring Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler could have been a hit. It would have given the scriptwriter an opportunity to really focus on the love between Arwen and Aragorn, and Arwen's decision to become mortal, thereby forsaking her chance to ever see her family again. That's some powerful love right there! "The Two Lovers", as this movie should really have been called, fails in capturing that love. Neither does it capture the sorrow Elrond must feel, knowing that he will live an eternity without his precious daughter.If you liked the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book for the REAL story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a strong, if somewhat wobbly first film, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy goes significantly downhill with it's inferior sequel. The Two Towers has all the strengths and flaws of the first, though the strengths have diminished slightly, and the flaws have an even bigger presence.The Two Towers is a continuation of the original film, in which a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins, as well as some friends, attempt to destroy a mystical ring, though dark forces oppose them.At the end of the first film, the main characters are split up, which unfortunately, makes the film extremely complicated. Various plot lines are juggled and if the audience doesn't keep track of them all, things can get extremely confusing.One plot line, involving Frodo and Sam attempting to destroy the ring on their own meet the Gollum. The Gollum is truly the most interesting character in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. His conflicted nature splits him into two personalities, one who wants the ring, and will kill to get it, the other that truly cares about Frodo and Sam. The most uninteresting plot line involves Pippin and Merry being taken by walking trees and forced to do....nothing. We scarcely ever see the duo, and when we do, it's often dull. The primary source of comic relief in the first film is gone, making The Two Towers especially hard to watch.There's less action and more talking. The length has actually been increased by a quarter hour, which makes the film even more tedious than the original. Even the dramatic battle at the end of epic scale is little compensation, as it doesn't feel very exciting.At times, it feels like The Two Towers is repeating itself over and over again. You can count on the fact that every hour or so, someone almost dies, only to be saved an arrow to the offender's head. It's the primary source of escape in this film.The acting, at the minimum, has not been hurt. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and the rest of the cast are as strong as ever. Christopher Lee's role, however, is significantly smaller, which is unfortunate.Special effects also have not been affected in a negative way, and they are just as grand and marvelous as ever.The score, by Howard Shore, feels a bit weaker than that of the original. The main theme is used less frequently, and the usage of lighter pieces are almost completely gone, due to the film's darker nature. It's still a good score, but it's weaker than it's predecessor's.Dull to the point of hair pulling, The Two Towers fails to entertain. Even with the addition of Gollum, The Two Towers is boring beyond belief, and the action scenes are minimal. With little to excite viewers, it's a marvel that this tedious sequel actually has a positive reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second movie of Great Trliogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! It's even better than the first one. I actually saw this for th first time just weeks after I saw the first movie for the first time.This has so many graphics and special effects, it's hard to know where to begin.**Minor spoiler ahead.** I like the part when you see a flashback, to when before Boromir was killed. You see that Boromir and Faramir were the best of friends, and their father, who wasn't very nice to Faramir, seemed to only love Boromir. After Boromir is killed, Dethomir blames Faramir. But Faramir only does what he feels is right. (Except for the time where he took Frodo and Sam to Gondor.) Not only is this a terrific movie, but it could not have been better. It may be too long for some people, but it it not too long to me.I think it is amazing that the two actors who played Boromir and Faramir have a certain resemblance.It is only 3 hours and 43 minutes long, and there's at least a half hour alone on the credits.If you like the first movie, you won't be disappointed in this movie.My Score: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the best movies ever. Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is amazing, with the Ents and the battle of the Ents. The flooding of Isengard. It's amazing stuff to see, honestly. Special affects are so well done. The extended one is obviously better. Fangorn Forest is real beautiful place,so old n mysterious looking, I mean it. The braking of the Fellowshiphas happened, separated in three parts; Frodo and Sam on the road to Mordor, Merry and Pippin captured by the Orcs and Urak-Kais,Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on the pursuit to get Merry and Pippin back. A good thing that Gandalf is back, he's a real help to the Fellowship. Also the kingdom of Rohan is so beautiful, very viking looking.Honestly Fangorn Forest is the best part of the movie. It's just so funny and emotional. Treebeard is so amazing, he just so slow moving, and he takes his time to do everything. It's quite awesome. The parts are also very well played(the hobbits are the best). It's amazing, anybody who has not seen it should watch it. PETER JACKSON IS THE BEST DIRECTOR EVER!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the expedition was in parts, the march was not over. Kind Frodo accepted bad Gollum without hearing the opinion of Sam. In fact without Sam, the task could not be finished. From the ending part of the first film, we could see Sam was realizing his promise.The ring began torturing Frodo. His flesh and soul suffered double strike. But he still persisted in it. That was the hardest moment for Frodo in the journey. Insisting is just the victory. So does it in reality.Although Saruman and Sauron were defeated, the dark lord Sauron still had the ability to reorganize the dark army and attack the mankind again. The peace for Middle-earth had not come yet.The hardship in the journey deepened the friendship between Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin. They endured the test, though the victory had not come yet. A friend in need is a friend indeed.As the second film of TLOTR trilogy, it is necessary and satisfying. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Continuation of the epic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As mentioned, Frodo and his buddies continue on their journey to destroy that pesky ring. The first film left us with the Fellowship broken and looking destined for failure, with Frodo and Sam continuing on as a scared yet determined duo, and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas moving on to fight other battles elsewhere as the evil surrounding Middle Earth continues to rise.While the first film was all about setting up the story of the ring and the Fellowship's epic journey across Tolkien's globe, The Two Towers throws up a whole series of curve-balls which really gets the action going; Frodo and Sam must recruit Gollum to show them the way to Mount Doom, Saruman builds the strongest army of loyal (and ugly) soldiers in history and we get a visit from an old friend who returns bigger and stronger than ever.What The Lord of the Rings series comes down to is a masterfully epic story about a hobbit. While these movies could have been overwhelmed by special effects and CGI, Jackson understands the soul of the books were not in the creatures and the battles, but in the characters that have to do things that go against their very nature in order to bring harmony back into their world. The Two Towers is a perfect middle section to this trilogy and, like The Fellowship of the Ring, leaves us with a cliff-hanger and a good reason to go see the next film. When all is said and done, these three films will forever be discussed as part of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the penultimate film representation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book series "The Lord of the Rings," "The Two Towers" was a blockbuster hit in theaters worldwide. Besides the fact that it was the film that would tie "The Fellowship of the Ring" to "The Return of the King, "The Two Towers" closely and effectively portrayed the text of Tolkien's book "The Two Towers" which helped to rake in a large audience - particularly those who knew Tolkien and his story of the Ring from his books. In terms of the film, Peter Jackson's excellent directing as well as the award-winning performances delivered by the star-studded cast allowed for the attraction of millions of viewers. Also, "The Two Towers'" epic battle scenes and constant sequences of action contributed to the film's overall attractiveness. Perhaps one very important characteristic of the film to note, however, is its special effects. Through the use of special effects, Jackson generated a film that stimulated the imagination of the audience, especially those who had read the book series, and brought them into a place where they could easily imagine themselves in Middle Earth, watching Frodo's quest omnisciently. The quality of the film combined with its accurate representation of Tolkien's book series both contribute to the epic nature of "The Two Towers" and also leave fans with an incredible story to remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers continues almost straight from where Fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are going towards Mordor, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).I was amazed by the special effects of the Fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in The Two Towers. I was gravely mistaken. In the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in The Fellowship, Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast.Small skirmishes of the Fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in The Two Towers, when orc army of Saruman attacks towards Rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king Theoden (Bernard Hill), who is mislead by his councillor Wormtongue (chilling Brad Dourif), while his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth.Theatrical version of The Two Towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. All this was fixed beautifully in the Extended Edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. I personally enjoyed all of the extended and added Ent sequences. Also EE introduces us one new character, Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir (David Fenham) and Boromir (Sean Bean).The battle of Helms Deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. Fall of Isengard, home of Saruman, is shown as Tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat.Peter Jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the Warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like Elves coming to help defend Helms Deep. Some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either.Overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. It all just shows, that The Two towers is just a middle part of a longer story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Two Towers almost as much as Fellowship. I liked the Helm's Deep battle and still think it is better than any of the battles in Return of the King. However as with most epic movies I find the little moments are the ones that define it as great. A tree with it's leaves on fire rushing towards an oncoming torrent of water to put it out. The obvious happiness of Smeagol as he finally rids himself of Gollum. Even Frodo's gradual slide into darkness as he spits venom every now and then at Sam. These are what make up a great story and that's what made Fellowship so great. The Two Towers are full of these as is the whole trilogy. The only disappointment in this film is the Warg attack. Very shoddy effects in an otherwise flawless movie. Very well done on all accounts.( Apart from the Warg attack.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my view the two towers will go down as my second favourite film of all time behind (obviously) LOTR: Return of the King. The film proved to be a much better film than the fellowship of the ring mainly because of two things. Helm's Deep and Gollum.Helm's Deep proved to be the most exciting siege film since The Alamo. 10,000 urik-hai against a small guard of farmers, old men and stable boys proved to be like David against three Goliaths. At the end of the battle mass audiences were stunned to witness a battle sequence as stunning as Braveheart in the part where Gandalf rides down the steep mountain with the Rohirrum as they attack the Urik-Hai to win the battle.This film had a bit of funny moments such as Gimli telling Legolas that he could have picked a better spot to see the mass army. Plus the same two characters counting how many Urik-Hai they were killing during the epic battle scene.New characters in The Two Towers included Miranda Otto (from War of the Worlds) playing Aragorn's secret love interest, Bernard Hill (Titanic) playing King Theardon and David Wenham (Van Helsing) playing Boromir's brother Faramir.But the new character who led well was the CGI character Gollum who joined Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the one ring. His mutters of 'my precious' had giving cinema a new movie line to join others.Also impressive where the tree ents who helped hobbits Merry and Pippin to destroy Isengaard with an exciting action sequence.Overall I preferred this film to Fellowship of the Ring and would say that it is my favourite 'second film' to a trilogy! Awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing directly on from the events of the last film, the Fellowship has been destroyed and it seems the bad guys have the upper hand. Gandalf is gone, Boromir has been killed, and the enemy's forces are growing to vast numbers and in power. They are spreading across Middle-Earth destroying all people, all races who get in their way in their quest for Frodo and The Ring. Saruman has been seduced by the evil, adding his superior skills and seeking out the remaining Fellowship members. Frodo and Sam travel on towards Mordor, followed by a mysterious creature. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to rescue their friends Pip and Merry who were captured by the enemy, an ork army. Things are looking bleak.The Two Towers, in splitting up the group becomes a more personal film for each character as we get to know them more in their individual struggles. Jackso deals with the different stories brilliantly and we never get bored of watching one group too much. There is always something new happening, a new character, a new threat or battle, and we feel part of the proceedings. Again the attention to detail is breathtaking, and the acting is just as good from both the old and new characters. We meet Faramir, brother of Boromir who also seeks the Ring as he wants to please his father and save his own city, misguidedly. We meet Gollum, once Smeagol a creature corrupted and transformed over the years by the Ring. He wants it, believing it is his and his alone, and promises to be Sam and Frodo's guide into Mordor, along secret paths. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli get an army together to protect the residents of Rohan in a massive battle against the evil forces of Sauran. The enemy is marching towards Gondor to destroy the worlds of man forever, and the good guys must fight for the two towers between Mordor and Isenguard. Merry and Pip meet the Ents, an ancient race of tree like creatures with immense power but slow pace. They set out to stop Saruman.It is this film which heightens the emotional impact of the series. We learn more of Aragorn's past, and his tragic romance with Arwen who must decide between her immortality or her love. The banter between Gimli and Legolas continues, Frodo and Sam begin to drift apart because of the traitorous Gollum, but not all is lost...Theoden has been saved by an old friend an uses his old courage to rally his troops to victory, his strong-willed daughter Eowyn taking an interest in Aragorn. We learn of Faramir's life which will be important in the next film. Again the effects are superb, and the battle scenes are probably the most epic and sweeping yet. They are all only there though to give Frodo and Sam a slight chance of making it to Mordor. Another truly stunning feat by all involved.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like all great classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general.Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics. I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion. (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions. You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films. The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books. There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions. Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once. All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks. Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses. The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings. This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment. Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights. Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you. The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep. You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sequel that develops the characters (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, "The Two Towers" is the most difficult of the "Rings" trilogy, possessing the same problem as "The Empire Strikes Back" in that it contains neither a beginning nor an end. Indeed, the story of "Two Towers" moves alot slower and goes through fewer events than its predecessor. What it does do very well here is to develop the existing characters to the point where they're ready for what happens at the end.The group of warriors that set out to destroy the One Ring has collapsed and the survivors have been split apart. Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd) elude capture by the Orcs and flee into the woods where they discover Gandalf (Ian MacKellen) really survived his encounter with the Balrog dragon. King-to-be Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) leads Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) towards the city of Rohan, which is in danger of being captured by the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his army. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) proceed towards Mordor, intent on destroying the ring. They're accompanied by Gollum (Andy Serkis), the Ring's former owner, a crazed, duplicitious creature hell-bent on regaining his "Preciouuussssss"......It goes without saying that viewers will have had to have seen the previous picture to understand this one. The interpretation of the book is accurate, although the key battle at the Helm's Deep sanctuary is given more emphasis in the film, and the final hundred pages have been clipped out for inclusion in "Return of the King". The script holds the story up well, and does a fine job of exploring established characters whilst at the same time introducing new ones.Of the new characters, Bernard Hill is convincing as Rohan's King Theoden, conveying well the stature of an aged, embattled but natural leader. Miranda Otto makes a striking impression as his beautiful daughter Eowyn. Brad Dourif has an all-too-brief cameo as Saruman's creepy servant, Grima Wormtongue.Yet is Andy Serkis as Gollum who makes the most memorable character. Although Gollum's outward appearance is digitally generated, it is Serkis who provided both his movements and his voice. He really makes the part his own. Gollum is a pathetic, devious, snide, disgusting yet pitiably conflicted character. He is positively a joy to watch.As for the others, Viggo Mortensen gets some good material as Aragorn, the quietly noble ruler-in-waiting caught in a love triangle between Eowyn and Arwen (Liv Tyler), his Elf lover. John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom develop a wonderful little-and-large comic rivalry as Gimli and Legolas. Wood and Astin are both good, painstakingly depicting the agonizing hardship of the two companions.Technically, the film is consistent with what has gone before. Cinematography maintains the distinctive blend of location and digital shots. Notable scenes in this film include an eerie sequence across the Dead Marshes, the battle at Helm's Deep and the final onslaught on Saruman's lair.A good follow-up, with enough it to whet the appetite for "Return of the King".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The epic saga continues, picking up right where the first left off, complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the Golden Hall of Rohan, hand-fashioned armor and elves!These works are perhaps the best I have ever seen. In the genre of fantasy, this series is seriously in danger of having replaced Star Wars as my all-time favorite movies.The direction was of the very best quality. The sets, designs, props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw.I highly recommend the extended edition, released in November 2003.The scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor, this production is as "epic" as they come; far larger than life. A task this formidable requires dedication, staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department.Neither were lacking here. I honestly found not one moment of wasted film, not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted, not one performance which was lacking in any way.While there WERE adaptations made to Tolkien's original literary work, I stand behind the creative decisions made, allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met, and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure.This work, with its story set at the edge of the fall of Man, was dark and twisted, yet leaving us with hope for Mankind's future. I thought Jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing.This movie (especially the extended version) is absolutely wonderful; a true credit to the whole industry. Too bad for us that Hollywood is not as bold.As did the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers rates a full 10/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Two Towers when I first saw it in the theater. I even went back to see it 3 or 4 more times. Still, I didn't think it measured up to Fellowship of the Ring. There seemed to be too much emphasis on action, and not enough on characterization and story development. The film also felt a little rushed in places.With Peter Jackson's "extended version" re-release of The Two Towers, it has gone from a very solid film to a truly great one. At times I felt as though I was watching an entirely new film. Critical story and character details have been enhanced, the timing improved, and a couple of important scenes were added. I now rate The Two Towers slightly above Fellowship of the Ring, which I still consider one of the greatest films of all time.There is no question in my mind that Lord of the Rings, treated as a single epic film, *is* the greatest film ever made. There are no weak points now that The Two Towers has been raised to the pinnacle. Here, at the end of all things, I am glad the DVD is with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to watch a film with great action, great effects, a great cast, and just basically great everything, but you're sitting on a couch in your living room wasting away, get your sorry butt off that couch and go to your theater to go se this film because it's just OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The action scenes are great, ranging from the 3-5 minute Warg attack sequence to the around half-hour Helm's Deep battle.The Warg attack is just great of the pure drama from slo-mo close up of Legolas firing an arrow to a wide shot where he fires another arrow with all the Rohirrim riders coming up behind him, then to him leaping onto his horse.Then the climax of Helm's Deep is great, beacause you have about 300 defenders at Helm's Deep, about 9-8000 Uruk-hai, attacking, then you have 2000 Rohirrim led by Eomer and Gandalf charging down; it's like a biblical climax.The film also has a great film score (music.) Like the Lothlorien thematic thread played in battle mode when the Elven archers start the battle, to the Isengard theme. Another great piece of music is when Aragorn is washed ashore after he falls in the Warg attack, and the music for the Last March of the Ents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended DVD version is excellent and better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of the extended DVD version.I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release. Note, that this version has more than just new scenes. Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way. The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow. Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original. Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn). It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.So, just like with the "Fellowship" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning. I already plan on only getting the extended version of "King" next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Film of Our Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second Lord of the Rings film though it may not be as great in my oppinion as Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I can watch over and over again. The acting is phenominal and score for the film beautiful. I would say that the only parts of the film that people could have downfeelings about are the changes from the book. I personally don't find them all that bad and rather quite enjoyable. Anyways, Thanks Peter Jackson for bringing me something to wait for each December or at least for one more December!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing - the perfect gift for a boy still lost in JRRT's pages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely fabulous. I really don't understand the spotlighted review's grudges against this movie.Some points I thought I'd like to rebuke:- He noted that he went to the theater thoroughly excited at the prospect of watching a JRR Tolkien film of Lord of the Rings, when in fact the director's name is Peter Jackson. If he wanted the "true" Tolkien experience on celluloid, I hear there's going to be a projection of the unabridged text onto a classroom screen somewhere in Oregon.- He also noted that Return of the King is the longest of the trilogy. The Fellowship of the Ring is the longest - RotK is helped along by the hefty appendices, which we can't expect to see in the movies. Thus, Jackson's moving of Shelob to RotK is understandable when you realize that tTT actually has a ridiculous amount of stuff going on.- As for his misspelling of Arwen, it looked more like Eowyn. In which case, what movie did you see?- A "real" Tolkien fan would have questioned the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep, or Faramir's sudden detour to Osgiliath. Anyway, why bother when we've been presented with this wonderful gift?And that about sums up my take on this movie. I've just recently seen the extended version of the Two Towers, and I absolutely applaud the editing that went into making this movie. While the deleted scenes are wonderful for background and such, the finished and final movie that hit theaters is the stronger for the editing. It takes a director and crew with vision and quite a bit of brass to make those decisions.I will also note that one of the most compelling war scenes EVER is Aragorn and Theoden leading the charge down the ramp and into a see of enemies. In-cre-di-ble.Here's to December 17th!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adroit adaptation of an extremely challenging novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems impossible to write a review of this film without turning into a comparison between it and J.R.R. Tolkien's original text. The deviations from the plot of the novel have been decried and also lauded.But that sometimes deflects readers from the nature of the accomplishment: Peter Jackson and company have taken a massive work (speaking of the entire trilogy), a sprawling work, and not just brought it to the screen but repurposed it to be a true film adaptation, playing to the strengths of the medium. The production team took a story that was plot-centric and made it character-centric; they took a story that in book form touched on an incredible number of areas and created a wonderful, rich universe and concentrated on the most important areas -- which makes it a less-than-perfect copy of the original source material, but a nearly perfect cinematic presentation of this story.As the middle part of a three-act story, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" was the most difficult to conceptualize and the most difficult to present on its own, and some hurdles were nearly not cleared...but they all were, eventually.It's important to accept the storytelling premise: this is not a standalone film. It's less about character development than "Fellowship of the Ring" was and it's less about closure than "Return of the King" will be -- though it has both of those elements. It's the second act: that part of the story where we put the characters into impossible situations, where the challenges crystallize. The REAL story isn't about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. It's about the internal journeys that Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and the rest each face. This film does an excellent job in getting that task done.THE GOOD: The awesome panoramas and physical scope of what you see on screen is ever-present, as it was in the first film and I expect will be in the last. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but most attention is placed on the ones that need it.Jackson's decision to jump right into the second film -- to actually treat it not as a "second film" but as a continuation of the first -- means that every moment of screen time can be devoted to fleshing out characters and themes, which means that this film will contain more messages and things to dwell on than most films will. Some will find that a negative, but I found it a positive. Certainly Tolkien provided ample source material to choose from.At the same time, the film does not attempt to flesh out everything from the novels, which helps the viewer focus on the important things.The action is fast-paced but not overbearing, the acting superb and the balance between the physical and the emotional is good. Everything you've heard about the performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum is true -- easily the most significant digital character ever and a crucial performance.Howard Shore's score is superb.THE BAD: If you are a fan of the books and unable to let go of the text and keep an open mind, you're going to be distracted. I am a many-times reader of the books and I couldn't avoid devoting much of my attention to plot comparison during my first viewing. But once that was out of the way, I found that each successive viewing was a better experience than the last one.If you are not comfortable with the entire fantasy genre, the good news is that "Lord of the Rings" doesn't overplay the role of magic in the story. There are fantastic elements of course, but most of what you see on screen (or on page, for that matter) is different in form from reality but not so much in function. That being said, "The Two Towers" has the most fantastic elements of the three volumes, and will be harder for you to swallow.With the plethora of characters and with Jackson's wise choice to focus on the development of the core ones, some characters seem to get short shrift, including Gandalf, who is in the odd position of being both a key mover of events but at the same time NOT being one of the core characters in terms of development. That can be disconcerting if you're not paying attention. "Lord of the Rings" is not a casual movie.A few of the visual effects are not up to par with the effects from the first film, though overall they are outstanding and in Gollum's case mind-blowing.Of course, "good" and "bad" are subjective. The "bad" parts I list above are pretty circumstancial and might not make a difference to you. They didn't for me, which is why I give "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" unabashed top marks.A NOTE ON THE EXTENDED EDITION: I found the Extended Edition DVDs to have great extra scenes that Tolkien fans will love and cherish (I certainly did), and the special feature had me completely enraptured. However, I still recommend the tighter, leaner theatrical cut as the better film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic MOVIE, and we must all remember this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so good. It gives me that feeling I used to get when I was a kid and a new Star Wars flick was coming down the pipe. All of the modern technological advances in moviemaking find raison d'etre in this saga without smothering the story in large production 'pomp and circumstance'.Yeah yeah, we can all get p***y about how the story wasn't followed to the letter and how license was granted in the embellishment of certain characters but we have to see this work for what it is, a MOVIE. MOVIES are not BOOKS. Anyone who uses this argument to downplay their opinion of Jackson's (et al.) attempt needs to revisit my previous statement. You cannot compare the two works as if they were the same variety of fruit and one is lacking in bouquet or has artificial color or flavoring. This reasoning is inherently flawed. Let's all give credit where it is due. Tolkien is the master of his world. Jackson is obviously a maestro in his own arena. I am so stoked that he has accomplished this with such aplomb. If we want to get upset at modern movie adaptations of excellent stories, why not pick on the Grinch or Interview With The Vampire or the impending Alexander The Great movie(s) (I may be jumping the gun on this last one, but why anyone would highlight the sexual practices of the greatest, most accomplished leader of ALL time as if it meant something is moronic especially considering the common practices of the day (I urge Baz and Oliver to read some J.F.C. Fuller on Alexander, please!). I would venture to say that, in the distant future if movie-like entertainment exists, no one would make a big deal out of how our modern leaders conducted themselves outside of the diplomatic/political/militaristic arena.)Hollywood misses the mark in so many ways. Why we would get so wrapped up in this silliness is beyond me. Three cheers for Jackson and Company!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man, where's a thesaurus when you need one!If you hadn't noticed, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Violence, greed, power, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography of a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.The first movie was a bit "too busy" for my taste. I prefer to inhale every now and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous fight scenes, there was enough pause to blink. The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because you got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters bickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing a five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more human.Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter. I don't think I could survive the 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready for it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area for the final chapter. If it's half as good as Two Towers, I won't be disappointed.Gee ... I guess I should go read the books now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended Excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the theatrical Two Towers even more than the first - it was darker, more suspenseful, more action-filled, and introduced some of my favorite characters. The extended edition gives viewers even more of the same - more heart, more comedy, more action, more character development, more sorrow, and more of a conclusion. My favorite scene in the extended edition is Faramir's flashback to a time spent with his brother and father. It really shows more insight into this character, making him seem less like Boromir-lite. It also shows more insight into Boromir himself, before he left for Rivendell, and introduced viewers to their father, Denethor, who is important to the third part of the tale. There's a lot more Merry &amp; Pippin, Treebeard, and Gollum. The DVD extras are fantastic, as we've come to expect. Watch "Cameras in Middle Earth," "Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth," "From book to Script" and the entire special on Gollum and music and sound in The Two Towers. (With 4 hours of extras, these are what I found to be the best) Really fascinating stuff here. The downside? The wait for "The Return of the king" seems even more unbearable now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation, but one flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material. It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.: Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo &amp; Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me! In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and deliberately uses it to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring. In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an excellent film. Again, I will point out that I was not a fan of the "Lord of the Rings" books.I saw the first movie and was blown away. It got my interest. Then I saw this second installment, and I was even more blown away. And yes, everything you heard about Gollum is true. He steals the show here.But Gollum has alot of competition. I was so captivated by the battle scenes, they were real. If anyone really wants to see how a war is waged and how it is fought (anything goes!), this is a place to start.I am saddened that this installment did not get named Oscar Best Picture for out of all of the Nominees, I would have chosen this over the MUCH overrated 'Chicago' any day. To do sequels in Hollywood is a mainstay these days.. but to Produce a sequel that is better than the first is rare (See the Godfather II for details) and this film is right up there with that kind of brilliance.A must not miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours long, tie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall plot, is no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers believe Jackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard to have some studio fund one movie that would require cots. Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers. I guess that is what is making alot of reviewers really angry - the Two Towers has gotten a very high score on IMDB. There's a great reason -the movie is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in the "purist" camp and find Jackson's work to be almost unwatchable. I have read the entire Lord Of The Rings sequence at least 20 or 30 times through my late childhood to adulthood, and for all it's flaws it is still a masterpiece.It is unfilmable, in Jackson's own words, so he has set himself up for failure. For all his technical prowess, and the amazing achievements by his creative team, this work lacks the depth of Tolkein's vision, and instead of requiring of us some imagination, it blinds us with special effects.Omissions are to be expected in a work of this scale - you can't take such a large tome and condense it, even into three movies, without losing some of the plot. But why make up plots that aren't there?In Jackson's middle earth, men are weak, prone to corruption, that is why Isildur takes the ring for himself and that is a theme that Jackson seems to catch onto and run with. Why? There are other themes of Tolkein's which were valid and valuable and would still speak to a modern audience.I appreciate that Tolkein's work lacked strong female voices, and have no problem with Arwen's character being built upon and extrapolated to a degree - her "rescue" of Frodo in Fellowship is quite thrilling I suppose, but this whole dream sequence in TTT with a whinging Elf princess and her overbearing father - characters I don't recognise whatsoever from Tolkein's work - add nothing to the story.The sacking of Isengard by the Ents brought a tear of joy to my eye, but otherwise I found this middle movie dull, unimaginative, and very much a victim of "hollywood spin".Let's hope the Return Of The King offers some satisfaction.</fullReview>

This second installment in the trilogy makes up for FOTR's arguably slow moving sequences through use of massive battle scenes, and a lot more character development.There really aren't many downers in the movie, save for the length of the movie - I can almost guarantee butt cramps and extreme tiredness. Drink some coffee before hand, and guzzle pop during.All in all, this movie is a remarkable affair, and leaves one drooling in anticipation for the final movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give TTT a 10, not because its perfect, but because its strengths so far outweigh its weaknesses. Like others it was disappointing to see the divergence from the Book, particularly regarding Faramir and the Frodo/Sam's trip to Gondor. It didn't make Faramir more real to me, as the screen writer argues, only less like Tolkien saw him (its sad that some people can't believe that there are those who resist temptation). Otherwise the film is such a pleasure to watch and become immersed in. You really get to see the world of Middle-Earth and experience the magic that originates from Tolkien's Masterpiece. Peter Jackson should receive every award available for his beautiful depiction of TTT. I was left only wanting more and would have been willing to sit through another 3 hours to see ROTK immediately after, as I hear they are doing in some theaters the day before ROTK comes out in December. Golem was the best supporting actor ever in any film. Yes he was CGI, but he was a compilation of many hours of human effort and expression -- brilliantly done. His character truly earned our sympathy and admiration often in the same scene. I laughed, I cried, I'm going to watch TTT over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's the lessened necessity for basic exposition, perhaps it's Jackson's greater willingness to depart from the precise events depicted by Tolkien, but for whatever reason, THE TWO TOWERS mostly (but not entirely) overcomes the superficiality and rushed feeling that marred its predecessor.That's not to say there isn't a misstep here and there: in particular, Aragorn's fall and recovery is utterly pointless, and the Ents lose much in the translation to film. And TTT inevitably fails to capture the depth and richness of the world Tolkien created, simply because no film possibly could. But as a movie, this one succeeds very well.I may actually go see ROTK in the theater now.8/10(Addendum: Full series only 6/10.

		<shortDescription>Just as spectacular as the first installment of the Trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' "Star Wars" movies and thought the "Star Trek" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing. But after watching "Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers" back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.This film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved. Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created. The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.The battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.Gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.Like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways. At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like "Snow White." These films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have. "The Return of the King" should be awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, director Peter Jackson is 2 for 2 for Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second part in what many are already saying is the greatest trilogy in film. LOTR: TTT is just as good as Fellowship if not better in some aspects.New characters are introduced and they are just as interesting as the great cast of the first film. Bernard Hill is noticeably good as King Theoden who has a powerful scene at the grave of his son. I also liked Faramir. Yes, he is different from the book but I thought David Wenham's performance was heartfelt and real. Miranda Otto(Eowyn), Karl Urban(Eomer), and Brad Dourif(Grima Wormtongue) round out the great new cast.The special effects are more frequent and extremely impressive. Gollum is a great acheivement in computer effects and definitely the most believable computer generated character. Treebeard and the ents also look fantastic. And the computer generated warriors at Helm's Deep are a sight to behold.This film is filled with so many great moments that it's hard to pinpoint just one. Gollum/Smeagol's duality, Ents storming on Isengard, The Battle of Helm's Deep, Frodo offering the Ring, Gandalf's ride to victory, and Sam's final speech are all fantastic. See this film. Great performances, incredible special effects and intense action make Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers the best film of 2002. Bring on The Return of the King!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. The question then commonly asked becomes, "Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?"The answer to that question is, really "deserved" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.However, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.I never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a "1" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disappointing film I ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the books a Million times and watched FOTR a thousand times. Then I went to the cinema to watch TTT. When I came out, I felt awful. I just had the greatest disappointment of my life! I just think, how bad ROTK must be, when they try to squeeze all the things they missed in TTT into it!SPOILERS AHEAD!!Since when can you ride down a mountain with almost 90 degrees angle? And since when can you ride into an army with long spears without being killed? And didn't this white stick of Gandalf just look like plastic? And what about these unnecessary changes in the film? When they would have left out these, they could have put the scene with Saruman and Gandalf and also Shelob's Layer in the film! I just hope that they don't leave out the scenes in ROTK where they go back to the shire and kill Saruman and also the scene at the grey havens. That would be really bad.. But I'll buy the Extended Edition of TTT and I will also watch ROTK more than once in the cinema. I just hope that I don't get bored until then...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like this, but I gotta give him that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let me first start of by saying that I am a LotR fan, and have been since junior high. The Lord of the Rings opened my eyes to a whole new world of action, adventure, and lost ideals that was just WAITING to be tapped into. When I first heard rumors in '98 of a live action movie, I could barely believe it. When I actually saw a trailer, I had a heart attack. When the first one came out, I died, but came back to life to see the second one. And now that all of America and most of the world has seen it, what do I think.Did somebody say "creative liberties?"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!Okay, sure, the movie more or less followed the tale set up in the Fellowship of the Ring, with Frodo and Sam having gone into Morder alone, Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn off tracking orcs to find Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf coming back in Fangorn. What I COULDN'T understand was why everything seemed to go in hyper speed. The entire Helm's Deep sequence seemed exceedingly rushed. It was all BANG, BOOM, SLASH, ORC FALLS, TWANG! HUMAN FALLS, ELVES DIE, GIMLI, ORCS, GANDALF, BOOM, SLASH, SLASH, CHARGE, SCREAM, fin. I couldn't keep up with everything going on. I didn't know if it took two days, or a couple minutes, it was so rushed.That aside, BY FAR, the most perturbing thing about The Two Towers was this: The elves marched into Helm's Deep. So aback was I taken, that, in a crowded theatre, I was inclined to, and actually did, yell "Did they just rewrite the whole BOOK?!" Though the audience in the theatre did find it amusing, I was genuinly disgusted. I couldn't understand why Jackson let the elves come to Helm's Deep. What prompted such a heinous and deliberate destruction of Tolkien's classic? It may have been for the continuation of the story line, but putting elves at Helm's Deep for continuity makes as much sense as keeping Boromir alive for "character value."Now those comments were biting, and horrible, but my review isn't ALL bad. Jackson is a very gutsy fellow, taking on something as big as the Lord of the Rings, and I'll be a chicken if he hasn't done well so far. With only a few discrepencies, he's managed to, at least, keep the story and all of the characters intact. That alone is more than can be said for most attempts at any book-movie adaptation. And for what it's worth, the first movie pulled off that new, fresh feeling that can't be conveyed in a book. The story was captivating, the characters 97% accurate (damn you, Arwen!!), and the villains truly villainous. Out of general principal, everyone should go see this movie. How often do we get to see one of the best literary works of our time transposed onto film? Do it. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh. So much for that idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt "The Two Towers" is a magnificent epic motion picture even that will go down into the list of Classic Movies. It's bound to pop up on several top-100 movies list and will probably end up in my DVD collection.(!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS !!)There's only one problem. THIS IS NOT THE STORY TOLKIEN WROTE! The story was changed too much. What's with Aragorn falling from a cliff into a river and getting saved by Trigger, the world's smartest horse? Pah! Pooh! Ack! What about the Uruk-Hai Orc yelling "Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys?" Ugh! Eeek! Pooh! And let's not forget that when they made Faramir mean they made him BORING! And why wouldn't Treebeard want to fight while in the book he clearly wanted to? Because Peter Jackson either does not understand the intricacies of the book or he just ignored it.Not too mention some of the changes brought into the book ONE MASSIVE inconsistancy. When Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to the besieged city (which was obviously inspired by "Saving Private Ryan") one of the Ring Wraiths attempt to seize Frodo. The inconsistancy lies in the fact that he has been spotted. So this is how it works; if the Black-Riders Ring Wraiths know, the Sauron Knows. If Sauron knew the Ring was so close then he would have send all his forces to that spot to capture Frodo and the Ring. Since, in the movie, this didn't happen, we now have something that does not make sense. The Dark Lord would have guessed what they were up to and would have tried to stop them.Another major problem is the fact that Jackson threw out all of Tolkiens subtleties and blew everything out of proportion. (Although the part where the Ents rampage through Isengard is still a great view! Ha!).Sigh. "Fellowship of the Ring" had it's forgivable faults. "The Two Towers" is almost unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so great!!! I mean everything of it was excellent: the story, the actors, the special effects, the music...every single thing of it was perfect. And I can't believe so many people are saying that it wasn't that good just because some chapters of the book weren't in it and it's crazy to not like it for that reason because it's impossible to make a 9 hour film...so I'm sorry to say this but those people are blind and don't know what a wonderful movie is... Anyways, every moment of TTT was incredible that I hardly blinked! Thank God Peter Jackson made this amazing movie for all of us!!!If you like fantasy movies, I promise you'll not get bored or anything like it!!! I'm definitely going to buy the DVD of this incredible masterpiece... All the things I've said make THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS one of my favorite movies!!!(of course my other favorite movies are FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and RETURN OF THE KING even if it hasn't come out, I'm sure I'll love it!)... I give this movie 10/10 and if I could, I'll give it more than 10!I loved it!...MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!!~*!!!PEACE!!!*~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Question:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie sucked so bad, then why did it get an Academy nomination from an academy that generally does not put fantasy movies in high regard? Remember, that Fellowship was also nominated for Best Picture, and it will not surprise anyone if ROTK also be nominated. I don't think an entire trilogy has EVER been nominated for Best Picture. Think about that. Also, if this movie sucked so bad, check out two sites which have collections of lots of critics reviews. Metacritic.com gave an aggregate rating of 90 to Two Towers. That blows almost every movie in 2002 away. Also, check out rottentomatoes.com. Same story. I'm not saying movie reviewers are god, but they sure watch more movies than anyone writing on these message boards. Hell, they do it for a living. Being as cynical as they are, they still by all accounts gave TTT (and LOTR) generally rave reviews. What does this mean for people who trash TTT and LOTR? It means that they are either incredibly cynical and will rarely enjoy movies. Or they are just incredibly stupid, and don't have the intellectual capacity to do so.</fullReview>

Too much American-like. Seems Jackson didn't understand the story at all. Even my friend who never read the book guessed (always correctly) what surely wasn't in the book: like that "exorcism" of Theoden... It was too much American-like: sweet, shallow kitsch with few interesting special effects - like so many others... LotR would deserve more.What would be last one like? Same rubbish, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson's Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler How can anyone who claims to be a Tolkien fan claim that Jackson's movies have been good. Now I can understand that certain scenes have to be modify or even left out due to time limits. I also don't mind additional stuff added in that were not mentioned in the books in order to bring in additional people. But I absolutely hate when Jackson decides to rewrite one of the greatest series ever.What do I mean by this? In the first movie, for the most part Jackson did do a good job. My disappointments: No Tom, I understand it was left out because of time, but No Tom. Making Merry and Pippen into clowns. Read the Books Jackson. Merry and Pippen did not steal food from Maggot after they were grown. Only as kids. The ending, Do you really think that Pippen and Merry would of let Frodo go off by himself, NOOOOOOOOOO. He should of keep to the book and had him run back to the boats in the shadow world which was a cool effect anyway.As far as the second movie, Jackson really screwed up the movie. The scenes between Aragon and Arwen, I don't mind at all. Not in the book, means it could of happen we don't know. But NO WHERE IN THE BOOKS does a unit of Friggin elves come down to Helm's deep, and Aragon never comes close to dying in the books except in the appendix where he does die of old age. For those two scenes, Jackson's Director chair should be chopped up and Jackson should be chased out of the movie buiz.To blantantly add stuff that never happened and never would of or could of happen just angers me to no end. So Mr. Jackson, please do us a favor and accidently destroy the third movie, because I know you are going to mess that one up also, and never do Tolkien again.</fullReview>

I mean, the movie has no sophisticated idea, the acting, besides maybe Gollum and Gandalf was pretty medium, and some aspects in the script really annoyed me (poor Gimli.. they turned him to a clown..). I found the movie very entertaining, but it was defiantly not 'the greatest movie of all time'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself. Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as "The Empire Strikes Back". Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of "Spartacus" and "Ran". Do computers make this any better? Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say "yes, they do". The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like "Fellowship" did. Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time. Oh well, watch this if you have time for it. I'll go back to "Empire" instead. Overall: !!! out of !!!!! time-wasting viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as great and epic as the FOTR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may contain spoilers and the following is all of My opinions.The Two Towers is an epic! In My opinion its just as great as the Fellowship but TTT is a much darker and violent film than the first part and has about same amount of humor.Viggo Mortensen was excellent and I really like his character.In the FOTR he showed a lot but in TTT he shows even more!Liv Tyler was great and she looked so good.The new characters such as Eomer,Faramir were very likable. Brad Dourif was awesome as Grima Wormtongue!Cate Blanchett really wasn't in TTT very long but she was very good.Another top notch performence!Christopher Lee was great and the others like Orlando Bloom as Legolas and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli was good like before.Ian McKellan was good as Gandalf but since he is Gandalf the White his character seemed different than he was in first part of The Lord of the Rings.Bernard Hill as King Theodon was good as well. As for the other stuff I was really fascinated by Treebeard and the Ents. I honestly thought that they would be to cartoony and wouldn't fit in the film but they were great.The Gollum CGI character was good and very realistic.I loved the giant elephants and the Wargs.I couldn't believe it when I saw the Ringwraiths riding dragons and the Cave Trolls are great.As for the film itself its a wonderful film. The scenery, the battles,every thing was great!The prolog was great with Gandalf and the Balrog. The Battle at Helms Deep was very epic and the three battle scenes at different places didn't hurt.Is all I can say is that TTT is a great film and its one of the best ever.I am glad the story is continuing with The Return of the King later this year and I can't wait to see it! If you haven't seen TTT yet and saw FOTR then go see TTT as it is phonemail film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving you off at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, it continues will no background of what had happened already. It makes the movie flow better. It also gives you A reason to see the first installment. Out of all the trilogies I have seen, never have I seen the second installment better than the first one. It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, "Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy." In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, "she will do it." But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty but Sad (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to like this film, but I can't. Why? For starters, and yes, I'm sure I'll get a lot of flack for this, I feel the main thing going for this picture, and the trilogy as a whole, is that is kowtows to geeks and makes them feel as though a geek film can be a great film. Unfortunately, as this movie and the first installment show, that's sadly not true.Don't get me wrong. I've been a "geek", by society's definition, for most of my life. Comic books? Check. Roleplaying Games? Check. But what you really have ask yourself when you view this film is, "If it wasn't based on this book that we've all read and love, would we think it was so damned fantastic when compared to truly great films?" The answer, if anyone is truthful, is "Probably not". The reason for the trilogy's ridiculously overinflated ratings is simple: It had a ready-made tribe of fans ready to love it, no matter what.Visually, the film is beautiful. The effects are a treat for the eye. The battles are sweeping and epic. Unfortunately, due to the massive number of characters in the stories, and the one-note nature of many of them, each and every one comes off as a cutout. Only the love story between Eowyn and Aragorn, and Smeagol's madness, have *any* moxie, and they don't have enough to buoy the whole picture. Shameless catering to modern tastes has Legolas "skating" on a shield. Yeah, that was in the book. (It wasn't, but you knew that). Gimli is portrayed as a bumbling fool, solely for laughs. We're shown 50 zillion times how the ring corrupts. (We got it the first few thousand times the point was belabored in the first movie).It's sad that people in search of validation for their lifestyle feel that they need to champion such a flawed film. All it takes is one look at IMDB's top 250...when you see that this movie is ahead of classics like Apocalypse Now and Rear Window, you know that the fanboys (and girls) are taking over the asylum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSRarely do I walk into a movie theatre with this much anticipation and expectations high as they were for THE TWO TOWERS. Only when viewing a STAR WARS movie am I this pumped, this high on what I am about to see. I expect an out-of-body experience and dammit, I better get it.The fact that THE TWO TOWERS delivered the goods when my expectations were so high is the biggest compliment I can give this film. Like a STAR WARS film, there are so many incredible cinematic moments that make THE TWO TOWERS worth the price of admission; the vertigo inducing fall of Gandalf and the Balrog which opens the film, the creation of Gollum- both as a CG benchmark and as the best new character in the film, the shot of the trolls opening The Black Gate, the battle between the Riders of Rohan on horseback and Orcs on Wargs, the fearful deep bass sound of the Nazgul on wings, the exorcism of Theoden, the arrow attack on the giant Olipants, and of course, the colossal and desperate battle of Helm's Deep. Again, as in STAR WARS, it is the characters that work so well to bring THE TWO TOWERS to life. Just like I did when I saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I spent the first half hour of THE TWO TOWERS with a silly grin on my face... Simply because I was in the company of these great characters again. The music too, is also a character. When Howard Shore's themes first rolled through the movie theatre, I felt like I was visiting an old friend.In THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, it was Frodo and Gandalf that carried the film. In THE TWO TOWERS, Legolas, Gimli and Aragon find themselves carrying the weight of the story, with the quest of the Ringbearer playing second fiddle to the Battle for Rohan. Gandalf, sadly, plays a small yet pivotal role, while the supporting characters are given a chance step to the forefront. Gimli especially, who suffered from trimmed screen time in the theatrical installment of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is brought to life here with fire and brimstone by John Rhys-Davies - not to mention some much needed, and quite effortless, comic relief for this grim chapter of the story.But who knew about Orlando Bloom? Nothing in the first part of the trilogy prepared me for the charisma and confidence he brings to Legolas in THE TWO TOWERS. Bloom displays remarkable power and grace in every aspect of his performance, from his quiet moments of pain and confusion when he believes Merry and Pippen to be slaughtered, to the fear and anger he expresses to Agagorn when he knows they are facing certain doom at Helm's Deep. Plus Legolas is so damn cool. When he deftly swings himself up onto a horse in slow motion, I almost screamed with delight.But by far the best character in THE TWO TOWERS is Gollum. Not only is he a masterpiece of CG, but he is wonderfully, performed, written and directed. The scenes of his split personality having heated arguments with himself are the most mesmerizing in the film. Especially subtle is the confrontation with Faramir when he huddles in a stony alcove with his back to us, his hands gently stroking his own shoulder when Smeagol speaks, then shaking with fists of rage when Gollum possesses him. Brilliant.Technically, Gollum's CG interaction with Frodo and Sam are seamless. They fight, grapple, touch each other, grab at each other's clothing - all with utter believability. The scenes at the foot of The Black Gate are especially impressive as Gollum desperately pulls at Frodo's cloak. The CG Gollum, the CG cloak, and the real cloak worn by Elijah Wood are all completely believable in the frame. The illusion is perfect.I have but one quibble with Gollum: he looks terrible in his very first shot! The first time we see his face when he is crawling down the rock face with the moon behind him is so CG! It's the only shot of Gollum that looks bad and it's the very first one!In terms of story, THE TWO TOWERS suffers the same unfortunately fate as the first film - there is simply too much crammed into the three hours. The film needs to breathe and settle down. Characters need to be fleshed out and given a moment or two more to develop. THE TWO TOWERS suffers the opposite fate of ATTACK OF THE CLONES: It needs to be longer!While the Rohan plot-line works superbly and drives the bulk of the momentum, the supporting subplots sputter and falter as the film enters it's second half. Merry and Pippen start off with all the fixings of their own fantastic little adventure, but then end up literally stuck in a tree for over an hour of screen time. Luckily, they march off to war in spectacular fashion with the Ents to save the plot line, but for the most part they disappear from the second half of the movie.Worse is the plight of the Ringbearer in his quest to find entry into Mordor. With Gollum and Sam playing well off their mutual dislike of each other, and Frodo fearfully watching the sky for the Wraiths circling overhead, all the cards are in place for this subplot to really be spectacular.It isn't.A bored-looking David Wenham shows up as Boromir's brother, Faramir, and the whole quest grinds to a halt. These scenes obviously play great importance to the fate of Gondor which will be explored in the final chapter, but here they are thrown at us quickly and with little foreshadowing. We are pulled away from the borders of Mordor to deal with a character we know little about, and who's plight isn't particularly interesting, especially compared to the epic drama that Rohan is facing. Worse, we don't know what Frodo, Sam, or even Aragorn think about the situation in Gondor. All we get is some brief voice over from Cate Blancett. It's far too expository to engage us and the drama falls flat because of it.The main reason this happens is because there isn't any time for Peter Jackson an company to tell this part of the story. Jackson, as he was with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is fighting the clock to try and get Tolkien's four-hundred-plus pages crammed into a three hour theatrical release. Frodo's quest suffers because of it. Faramir needs to be set up with the same drama and intrigue as King Theoden is set up, but that would mean lengthening the film by at least twenty minutes - something that Jackson doesn't have the luxury of doing. We can only hope that when the DVD comes out that Jackson is able to work the same magic as he did with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - THE SPECIAL EDITION.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic, spectacular and thrilling, but also flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'7 1/2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sadly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as a fan of the books and a really big movie buff, i was nonetheless disappointed with TTT. maybe because the first one was so excellent, especially the extended version, which unfortunately one can only watch television-size. it seems to me that a pattern in emerging, where you leave all the quiet, but very important, scenes between actors out of the theatrical version, and instead concentrate on the action pieces. but the tenth shot of an uruk-hai bellowing or of women and children looking frightened becomes boring or pathetic pretty soon. and of course there are the story changes: most of them totally unnecessary and not helping the plot at all. i dont mind the scenes between elrond and arwen (although elrond is really painfully miscast) and the conflict of mortality that arwen faces. in fact, those dream-love scenes were a welcome respite from the action pieces. speaking of which, the whole warg-attack was so useless and stupid! it reminded me of star wars, not a good comparison in my mind. and that aragorn drops off the cliff was dramatically ridiculous. not even people who havent read the book will believe that one of the main characters would die like that in the middle of the movie. furthermore it just mirrored gandalfs fall in the first movie, but at the same time belittled that event. i could go on and analyse the whole movie like that, but whats the point? the addition of laborous action pieces seems the main intent, and not staying closer to the book in terms of story-telling. i think its wrong to consider those movies as pure action-flicks that have to cater to teenage boys. after all, the books are very much loved by men and women alike.so i can only wait for the extended version, where all the really important scenes might have been put back again.... i really love the first movie, but after TTT im sadly pessismistic about part three. the filmmakers left out so many important story-elements, they will never be able to finish the story in any way that resembles tolkiens book!</fullReview>

FELLOWSHIP was good but doesn't compare to THE TWO TOWERS. The second film in this trilogy is a masterpiece.Peter Jackson has captured the essence and the spirit of Tolkien even if some details have been omitted. How in heaven's name could he have put in EVERY detail. The movie would have been seven hours long!One reviewer on this site actually said he didn't like the smile on a kid's face in the caves.The Middle Earth atmosphere, trueness of the characters, the magnificent battles, the spiritual imagery in every scene overwhelmed and humbled me at the same time.This is the best movie ever made.

I must admit I wasn't too big a fan of the first part, but the second part really got me annoyed (the crucual battlescene lasts for almost a full hour). So, everybody wants the ring. Big deal.

		<shortDescription>Forcing oneself to enjoy a movie that should not require any effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TWO TOWERS had much going for it. It continues the tradition of beautiful scenery and likeable characters. There are new characters introduced, all of which add to the splendor and majesty of the trilogy. But that is where everything ends. My friend finds my review, "a jaded view that the general audience has this day and age." Well, in all honesty, the production effort was completely superb, but it was blatantly NOT original and what I think to be totally off the cue of what Tolkien himself had in mind for a movie of this kind of magnitude. THE TWO TOWERS stunk up the theater with the type of theatrics we see over and over and over in every movie of this type of epic throughout the nineties (comparisons of JURASSIC PARK and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES are at the forefront in my mind). I mean the overbearing music that guides the viewer, the grand scale cinematography with the characters trudging along in it. The gentle hearted approach to the characters so we can laugh when we want to and pray for the good fortunes of others when the danger approaches. We have seen this constantly and Peter Jackson has never strayed far from the typical Hollywood epic. It is not a bad thing, but who wants to force themselves to enjoy a movie that deserves to be enjoyed?The adventure continues as Frodo and Sam further their quest to destroy the one ring, while the remaining fellowship members search for Merry and Pippin.The main battle at Helm's Deep will have many people talking for awhile. The fight is tremendous and worth a rent. Gollum does deserve notice, and praise as well. The ents were nicely done in their special effects. Nothing special emerges from THE TWO TOWERS that make it memorable and three hours is quite a long time. The movie is far from faithful to the book, but no one seems to notice that. Action has replaced adventure but it's your call. I give it a cautious thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film, but a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.Director Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.Now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies. The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.Being Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present. That is not the case.Instead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie. There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight. These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.There's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months. Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out. But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick. In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.Complaints aside, this is still a fun movie. For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not. Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing. I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece. This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick. Fun movie? Yes. Great special effects? Yes. Another classic? No.On a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great. It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time. This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters. The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best. The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story. I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf. Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would. Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1. I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3. I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite. It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic scenes save Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what "new" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a "comic" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, "Why am I here with these actors?" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it. "The Two Towers" has just opened. One can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. At the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all I can say is, let it be...I have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, "The Fellowship of the Ring". Like that much loved film, I do not judge "The Two Towers" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. I look upon it as a further unveiling of Peter Jackson's LOTR mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. But that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as I'm not a believer in "taste-dictatorship". Notice I stated Peter Jackson's and not Tolkien's LOTR. With all due respect for JRR Tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), I think that LOTR should by now be just as much a labour of love for Jackson as it once was for Tolkien. Judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what Jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right. Dissenters of LOTR movies, we know who you are. In an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. But in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. For good or evil, I have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. I will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments TTT will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead. I have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. That I love the LORD OF THE RINGS movies, is but a given. That I am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. A choice which I pray I will have the strength to honour. Consider that my leap of faith. In conclusion, the story is far from over. Like Gandalf's famous last words in TTT (the movie), "The battle for Helm's Deep may be over, but the battle for Middle Earth has just begun..." Till then, I shall breathe, while I wait for "The Return of the King"...peace and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TTT is fantastic, I love it! It's the most comedic of the 3 and it's the one where we get to see the characters individually and a lot clearly. TTT introduced us to Treebeard, Gandalf the White and allowed us to connect with the characters in 'Middle-Earth'. My favourite aspect of LotR: TTT is beautiful scene where we are introduced to Gandalf the White (I'm unsure whether this is a spoiler, but it's on the cover photo so I'm assuming it's not...) for the first time and it invigorated everyones horripilation of happiness which raised the hairs on our arms.Regardless of the acting, storyline and visuals (which were all amazing) the best thing for me about TTT is the communication between Gimli and Legolas, it really showed their understanding and connection with each other as well as adding the best comic relief in any action movie I've ever seen!The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best of the trilogy! I can watch this one over and over. I read the books at a young age and the two towers was the page turner for me. I feel the same about the movie. The hardest part for me to get through is the Frodo/Samewise scenes. They tend to drag on and on, however the Arogon scenes are great. A lot of emotional scenes, like when he returns to the castle. My father and I argued about the Ents in the film but I explained to him they are a vital part of the story. He never read the books so he had a hard time understanding the concept. I would recommend seeing the film. Some people may have issues but I believe Peter Jackson did a great job with the story. Many series and movies today owe him for allowing these fantastic stories to be on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no need to spend words for this movie. It belongs to the serial that has become one of the best serial, but probably best serial of all the times. Absolutely astonishing. It has won 17 Oscars,this movie just 2, but anyhow it is one of the most known movies in the world and it belongs to the most known series in the world, along with the Star Wars. Acting, picture, music, everything is perfect. Not a single thing is missing from any of this movies. Peter Jackson transfered the plot from the books perfectly, and Tolkien created something unique,and we can only thank him for his imagination. There are so many actors who became so famous because of this movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent second part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quest to destroy the One Ring continues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The party has split, with Frodo and Sam continuing on to Mount Doom. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are chasing the orcs that captured Merry and Pippin. Gandalf is flying around naked on a giant eagle (thankfully not shown in the movie) and Boromir's moldering corpse is floating down the Anduin River. From here, the movie follows three story lines; Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum, Aragorn and company allying with Rohan against the forces of Saruman and Merry and Pippin meeting tree-like giants in Fangorn Forest.I'll be the Negative Nancy here and say this movie sucked. The acting took a nose dive, the sense of desperation that was repeatedly said to be there just didn't click and a major character was all but completely rewritten for some unfathomable reason.Elijah Wood (Frodo) developed a forced, annoying accent, a bad thing when he is supposed to be carrying half the movie. Sean Astin's (Sam) demeanor shifts toward his two traveling companions were jarring and forced, making Sam seem somewhat bipolar.As for the writing, there was just way too much going on with far too much attention being paid to the Battle of Helm's Deep and Frodo's encounter with Faramir, leaving Merry and Pippin's time with the Ents seem ironically hasty.This movie does have good points though. The cinematography was again, beautiful and the acting from several of the cast helped to somewhat mitigate the awfulness of Wood and Astin. While there was a hell of a lot going on, it flows by quickly and is paced well, though it doesn't seem especially urgent...like everyone keeps insisting on reminding us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something worth fighting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), "The Lord of the Rings" took the audiences by storm when "Fellowship of the Ring" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and "Two Towers" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where "Fellowship" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve "the master of the Precious." But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: "But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer." These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of "Fellowship," are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course "Two Towers" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, "Two Towers" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.</fullReview>

The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it. I can't wait to watch the final movie of this trilogy, but I'm also shocked at the fact that it's four hours long! It's really impressive how a single trilogy can be eleven whole hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most epic story of all time lives on in a groundbreaking sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings" lives on and continues the story in a way that helps us understand our unique characters and Middle Earth and to better appreciate the story. "The Two Towers" is the second out of three "Lord of the Rings" masterpieces coming after "The Fellowship of the Ring" and prior to "The Return of the King" the best out of the three. "The Fellowship of the Ring" brought us into the core story of two hobbits, Frodo and Sam who are to destroy the evil ring of Saroun and vanquish evil in Mordor. Frodo and Sam are continuing their path into Mordor to destroy the ring with the help of a very different creature named Gollum who was cursed by the ring and knows the path to Mordor. This causes tension between Frodo and Sam before they get caught up in their most challenging path yet. Arragorn, Legolas and Gimley encounter the soldiers of Rohan after searching for Pipen and Marry after they were captured by Saruman's orcs. They enter Rohan and help the poisoned King Theoden help his people from danger with the assistance of an old friend. Pipen and Marry escaped into a lush forest home to tree creatures who have been victims of Saruman as well. All these magical stories come crashing down into intense battles, heart-warming character encounters, beautiful friendhsip, bravery and more. "The Two Towers" is a much more entertaining film than we have seen in recent years. We already have the main plot covered from the first film, so now director Peter Jackson takes us into Middle Earth in a more uncharted and rugged way. We meet the kingdom of Rohan and see them fight in an epic battle between Saruman's menacing orcs after we already get frequent action sequences prior. There are also many new characters we meet that all provide something to the plot. They are not just there to make the story have more conflict, but rather they serve a vital purpose into this epic plot. The new creatures we see are so shocking when we finally see them. Walking and talking trees, dragons, gollum, Uruk-hai orcs and more. Peter Jackson worked extremely hard on making every element plausible and magnificent in order to bring Tolkien's pages to life. He uses vivid camera work with either extreme beauty or ominous vibes. The visual effects are the stuff film schools will look at and read about hundreds of years from now where the editing and cinematography is second to none. This isn't only a genius story brought back to life in a magnificent way but a visual phenomenon that cannot be missed. "The Lord of the Rings" are three stories we have to experience sometime in your life. Cinema is by far the best way to do so and with "The Two Towers" your able to experience an even more far side of Middle earth like you couldn't imagine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien. The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. "The Two Towers" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, "The Fellowship of the Ring." It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word epic doesn't really do justice to what the Lord Of The The Rings are but it is as close as you are going to get to perfection in film and The Two Towers are no different. The story sees The Fellowship broken and Frodo and Sam are still heading to Mordor this time with the help of the creature Gollum. While Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli searching for Merry and Pippin who are still in the possession of the Urk-Hai. The acting in the film once again is superb with Elijah Wood doing a great job as the ring becomes more of a burden to him as the film progresses and adds to the film. Viggo Mortensen really shines in this film as Aragorn as he becomes more of a leader and his character really truly shines. Ian Mckellen returns as Gandalf and for the scenes that he is in he shines as the mentor he is. Also the rest of the assembled cast were great with Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies chemistry really shining. But a huge mention has to go to Andy Serkis as Gollum who with his motion capture performance really changed the world of film as we know it and I think was robbed of a supporting actor Oscar nomination. There are 3 stories in the film and for the most part the Aragorn and Frodo stories are great with Merry and Pippins story dull but by the end it feels great also. So overall the stories in this film are top notch and really raise the level of stakes in the film. The script is great with a great variety or heart and comedy and the dialogue is fantastic between everybody and it looked like they were all having fun. The style of the film is breathtaking and just like the story raises the stakes especially with the Helms Deep battle that is utterly great. Overall this is one of the best sequels ever made and I absolutely love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in "Return of the King" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The "Two Towers" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut.</fullReview>

I guarantee that if you have taste in movies, you will enjoy this trilogy. If you have a HiDef TV, or surround sound, this movie is a must see. However, in order to completely understand the plot in its entirety, it is almost necessary to view these movies in complete succession. Some may see this as a daunting task, but it is definitely worth it. For fans of the original books, i believe this movie to closely follow the plot of the books. While it can be assumed that some of the original plot has been removed, these movies are still quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

Spoilers! *** Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way through Emyn Muil, a area with razor sharp rocks, and a place which is basically in the middle of nowhere. There is a humorous part with the elvish rope that Galadriel gave Sam in FotR. They had to use it to climb down what seemed to be a huge cliff, but really it was pretty short. Meanwhile, Gollum has been following them, and soon they realize that they are not alone. Gollum eventually attempts to steal the Ring from Frodo, but fails to do so. He later "promises" to show Frodo and Sam where the Black Gate is. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hot on the trail of the Uri-Kai, the Orcs that kidnapped Merry and Pippin. They soon meet Eomer, who is the nephew of King Theodon of Rohan. Theodon had been taken over by Saruman, it's a bit complicated, but Gandalf (who, as you know, fell in Moria and was believed to be dead) eventually goes to the trio, and they go to Rohan, to free the King from the power of Saruman.Anyway, Eomer had been banished from Rohan by the order of the brainwashed Theoden, who wasn't in his right mind at the time. Gandalf shows up and frees the King from the clutches of Saruman. They know trouble is coming, so they decide to flee the city.They go to Helm's Deep, which is a fortress and a place of protection for the people of Rohan. 10,000 Orcs are sent from Saruman to destroy the people at Helm's Deep. He had been told by Wormtongue (a former "servant" of Theoden's) that Theoden would go to Helm's Deep.There followed a great battle T Helm's Deep, and for a while,m it looked like the Orc's would win. Then Gandalf show up with Eomer and many of his men.Many things happen that I have not said, but I cannot and will not say everything that happens.This is a well-made movie, and it is given a perfect 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is freaking hard to make a movie out of a book,. The main problem is that the book inspires as many visions of the story as there are readers reading it. Now if one guy (in this case three) writes a script it will by all means not satisfy everybody. It can't. Remember when you read the books I mean it was your story it was your vision it was your world. Now there's someone stepping in here and telling you it's different from what you thought it was. Well of course it's not gonna work. I think Peter Jackson has created a film that reflects a book as good as possible, especially an epic story like TLOTR, which at one point can be looked at as a mythology of England. So do the Nibelungenlied or homer's Odyssey with an equal amount of success. I don't think so! It is art and not everybody is an artist. Sorry but Peter Jackson is the one and only who ever brought justification to a book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stupid, fat hobbit."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would give the film a 8.5/10 but it comes with a warning of advice. For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings. I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which. I also found it hard to understand the thick "Middle Earth" accent. Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago. In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions. "Who's that? What did he just say?" There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story. I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category. A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact. A movie should be able to give you all you need such that you can take whatever you need from it in one sitting. The ring "films" don't do that with me. That is my caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of the 3 movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy. Why? I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us. Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it. Very well done in this sense. Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background. When Eomer delivers the line...."Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands." it still gives me goose bumps. Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn..."Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone." Awesome....Some other awesome things I loved about this movie:-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!! I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)I think I'll watch it again tonight</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been as good as the first part, if Jackson had more respect for Tolkien. Those scenes of Aragorn dreaming of Arwen or utterances that may appear good in script but sound stupid on the screen (running heavy breathing Legolas speaks to himself: red sun rises, blood has been spilt this night) have pretty much harmed this otherwise good film into something that one can't watch without a very unpleasant shivering sensation down one's spine. Fortunately, there are still more good parts than those bad ones, so this is more or less a fine movie. Hope that the Return of the King ends up better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent but dull, or dull but competent?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some tremendously exciting fight scenes in `The Two Towers'; in fact, it's probably Peter Jackson's most excitingly choreographed work since `Braindead.' Most of the cast reiterate the fine performances they gave in the first film, and there are some nice additions, particularly Brad Dourif's hammily rotten Grima Wormtongue. The production as a whole is as focused and thorough and poker-faced as we've come to expect from this team.But unfortunately, we find that much of the fun we had in the first film has drained away. `The Fellowship of Ring,' for all its critical overpraise, worked in the same way a BBC children's miniseries would--the plot was simple and episodic, but it was always on the move, with our young heroes and their British-character-actor friends and foes tumbling from one scrape to another. It was good childlike fantasy fun from beginning to end. `The Two Towers,' on the other hand, is adult in the least fun sense of the term; it's dominated by its Rohan/Theoden storyline, and as such bogs down too much in the simplistic, boring propaganda of Tolkienian politics. Like the people of Rohan, this subplot pushes itself into a hole from which it is very difficult to get out. This provides opportunity for some grand battles, as I said, but between the flying arrows and battering rams and severed orc heads, not much happens.The two other storylines are a mixed bag. Frodo and Sam's road trip to Mordor is by far the best part of the film, even if the slippery CGI Gollum distracts too much from the hobbits' character development. This Gollum isn't quite the revelation he's been made out to be; there's a bit too much of a cartoon to him. Andy Serkis's Donald-Duck voice is part of the problem, yes, but most of the fault isn't the actor's. Rather, the CGI animators, for all their technical brilliance, have been allowed to run away with themselves, and the combination of a hyper-expressive CGI face and hyper-chaotic CGI body language makes for a performance that's hammier than it should have been, and could have been. I would much rather have seen a `Dark Crystal'-esque puppet in the role, personally. Still, the interpretation is a well-conceived, respectable take on Tolkien's most human character, and there are times when the animators actually do hold themselves back, and the character finally becomes convincing. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood offer nice, subtle performances, but as I said, it's hard to notice them when that little bug-eyed fellow is mugging for the back row the whole time.As for the Ent storyline, well, it's a complete wash, as plodding and obvious as the big tree-people characters themselves. It's not so much that there's anything wrong with the look of the Treebeard character or with John Rhys-Davies's voice acting, but Jackson's managing of Tolkien's triptych structure (which split the three storylines into completely different books) doesn't really work here. It's one thing to jump back and forth between the Frodo/Sam and Aragorn/Theoden plots, because things are actually happening in them to move the plot along. (They're not always interesting things, but you take what you can get.) But literally NOTHING happens in the Ent storyline until the very end of the film, and jumping back to it every twenty minutes or so stalls the action terribly. Not only that, it confuses the three subplots' temporal arc--come on, the people of Rohan have debated on what to do, fled Edoras, made an exodus to Helm's Deep, fought battle after battle after battle . . . and Merry and Pippin are STILL riding that miserable tree across the forest?Yet, for all its drawbacks, the film as a whole may be better than the sum of its parts, and fanboys, as always, will be less concerned with how entertaining the film is than with its minor digressions from the book. Non-fanboys will find it competent, certainly, but also a bit dull. 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in "Fellowship") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as "actors", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic "sweep", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as "Smeagol/Gollum" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.I think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the "dullness" comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's "dullness" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called "filmmaking", along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fantasy films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic. The performances are on, with Rhys-Davies and Bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film. The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning. But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others: Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be. It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature. Never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters.</fullReview>

It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides. There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson. The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen. I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance. His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored. The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film. A definite must-see. I can't wait for "Return of the King"!</fullReview>

Hopefully the creators make as much money as they have expected, because that's what it's all about here.Most figures in computer games act better than the people in this film. The effects are also to be found in computer games and even better made there. There are in fact a little more humour in this part (in the first one there was almost none of it) and that comes from John Rhys-Davies who tries to make something artistic of his dwarf behind the beard.We don't see that much of the four boys or what they are supposed to be. This is far from Tolkien's intentions and one wonders indeed why grown-up people are that interested. If you are 11 years old or younger you might be entertained, but most people aren't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS COMIN' UP! BE YE WARNED!I agree with everyone here who says that the book and movie are separate entities. It is unfair to expect the same exact plot regurgitated onscreen. That's not what a movie should do. But...The Two Towers is visually stunning and scored wonderfully. If nothing else, Peter Jackson is a near-perfect director from a technical standpoint. His shots of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running and then riding across Middle Earth are beautiful and awe-inspiring. The battle at Helms Deep is also a tremendous accomplishment in terms of the reality of a medieval battle as one might imagine it.Jackson also does make the three plots from the book work in the movie. Abandoning Frodo and Sam for the first half of the movie would have failed miserably. He does a very good job of mixing up the three stories enough so that you're not wondering what the heck happened to any set of characters (a suspense tactic that works well in the book that wouldn't work in the movie).However, there are problems that keep this movie far from epic status. The two glaring holes in "The Two Towers" are a) a lack of explanation of what certain characters or places are and b) little or no characterization (character traits or actions that wouldn't make sense unless you read the book).The transition from "Fellowship" to "Towers" is great...but then it gets a little disjointed. There's no explanation of what Rohan is, and what it has to do with the destruction of the Ring. As the movie goes on, the plot diverges so far away from the Ring that it almost becomes forgotten, except for the obligatory scenes where Frodo gets moody or angry or violent. By the end of the movie, the story has moved so far away from the significance of the ring, and so near the "battle for Middle Earth" that it's almost a mystery what these people are fighting for.But my biggest problem with both movies is the lack of characterization, for the most part. What little characterization there was in the first movie is almost completely lost here. Frodo's character - probably the strongest in Fellowship - disappears here, with Jackson giving Elijah Wood little to do but stare with those big blue eyes into the camera and go through mood swings. Gimli becomes an even bigger joke, Aragorn is a mystery (why is he such a leader? Never truly explained.) and everyone is swept away by events without ever really participating in them. This would be fine if the events were built up to, but they never really are. Things just happen in Jackson's version of "Rings," and the reasons are seldom satisfactory.One of the greatest scenes in the Star Wars Trilogy (and perhaps one of the greatest movie scenes of all time) is when Luke Skywalker decides to leave Dagobah to save his friends from Darth Vader. He's torn by the decision, but he knows that he has to be true to who he is. It's a human decision made in a supernatural world. At that moment, we feel for him, and admire and care for him because we probably would've done the same thing if placed in his position.Tolkien also had his characters make these kinds of decisions. In "Fellowship" the book, the Fellowship decides to go through the mines of Moria by vote, whereas in the movie they have no choice. This lack of choice is even starker in "Towers". Saruman influences Theoden's character in the book, but Theoden falls under the wizard's spell in part because he is willing to do so, not because he's literally possessed. In the book, Aragorn gives up the search for Merry and Pippen because he decides that it is more important to help Rohan, even though the decision tears him apart. In the movie, Peter Jackson takes these decisions away from the characters and, by doing so, nullifies what makes them seem real. Without this strength of character, "The Two Towers" becomes a movie where fate overwhelms the human strength that makes characters - and movies - worth remembering.And the dialogue - what little there is - is slightly below average, at best. Theoden, in particular, has two clunky speeches, and the one about "the father outliving the son" was extremely cringeworthy."The Two Towers" falls short of epic by a long shot. It definitely doesn't belong in the Best Picture/Greatest Film of all Time realms either. Bascially, this is a nice looking film that has its moments, but fails to cohesively bring them together. It's clear that Peter Jackson has a love of these books, but the screenwriters' working on this film don't have the ability to pull it all together. It's as if the expectation is, "well, you've seen enough of these types of movies by now to know that Aragorn is the strong hero, and Saruman the bad guy, and Frodo the classic underdog." Apparently, the majority of comments on this movie put me in the microscopic minority, but I just don't get why everyone is drooling over this film. I'm not sure if it's because of a love of the books and seeing the characters come to life or a feeling that, "well, now our generation has our Star Wars Trilogy." I give this movie a 5/10, and hope that if Oscar feels the need to give a nom to a mainstream movie, that they give one to "Minority Report" or "The Road to Perdition" - two films with better performances, better characters and superior stories.</fullReview>

She actually BELIEVES she can improve upon Tolkien...On changing Faramir in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) script: "If you're trying to up the tension, you don't have your main characters captured by someone who sort of interrogates them, but, not really, who then offers them a cup of tea and says, 'I'll do anything I can to help you.' It's death on film. And it's not just the effect that the character out of the book has on Frodo and Sam's journey, it's the effect that character has on the Ring. You've just been desperately trying to establish that this is the most evil thing ever created, it's tearing apart the mind of your main character, it's reduced this other character to this miserable creature Gollum, and now you come along someone who says, 'I would not touch this thing if it lay on the highway.' You've just stripped the Ring of all its power."Miserable, just miserable. Any wonder that this film is completely shapeless, dramatically?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not "really" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10</fullReview>

Except Jackson doesn't know how to direct it. The tone wavers. It goes between terror (women and children expecting to be slaughtered) to comedy with Gimli and Legolas. And then he keeps interrupting the battle in order to cut to those boring bits with the talking trees. He even adds slow motion in the battle scenes for no good reason. The end result is that there is no rhythm to the battle and the emotion is dissipated. There you have it. Lots of noise and CGI, and no emotion - apart from boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the wonderful realization of "The Fellowship of The Ring," I was greatly anticipating the next installment with "The Two Towers." As a writer I can understand that some changes need to be made to adapt a book to a film; however, I think the title given to this movie should have been "Peter Jackson's Two Towers." The plot changes and additional scenes with Arwen were absolutely unnecessary for translating the book to film. These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.There was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace." Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in "Fellowship of the Ring" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the "Two Towers" book! Ugh.I'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry. I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another epic achievement from one of the gods of the film-directing world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I was so hyped for this sequel that I couldn't slot the disk into the DVD player fast enough. When this film opens, you are plunged into the epic world of Middle Earth every bit as quickly as you were by the first. The intoxicating music instantly ensues, and the top- quality entertainment blasts you in the face once more.This film has quite a different tone to the first. Fellowship was extremely redemptive - and quite family-friendly, actually - but Two Towers is much darker, with much more of a grittiness about it; the "12" classification was certainly well merited. This said, you do still get the same much-needed moments of comic relief that you did in Fellowship, although it has to be said that they are noticeably more infrequent in this film.Now, the action scenes; they are where this movie REALLY hits home! You are RIGHT on the edge of your seat during the battle scenes. The choreography of said scenes is PITCH...DARN...PERFECT - have another two golden globes on me, screen-player - and the CGI used in the battle scenes is actually even better than it was in Fellowship. (I haven't yet watched this movie in Blu-ray, but I reckon that if I had, I would have felt as though I were leaving the real world behind).The characterization is once again as spot-on as ever in this film. Frodo and Sam are every bit as poignant as they were in Fellowship, and Legolas and Gimli seemed to have taken a very pleasing turn for the role of a dynamic duo! Seriously, the two spin a generous few moments of subtle comedy between each other, on quite a regular basis, a couple of which are delivered - would you believe this possible? - right in the middle of the heat of a battle scene! SUCH an effective counterbalance, I say. The settings and panoramas are every bit as good as they were in Fellowship - and in a few scenes, they are (dare I say it?) even better! - with the backdrops of the wilds of New Zealand once again giving us a show of unbelievable grandeur.Now, I said that the tone of this film is rather different to that of Fellowship. Apart from the darker dimensions, I would say that Two Towers is somewhat "quieter", in places, shall we say. I mean, Fellowship was a giddy, sustained-adventure-filled epic of constant thrills and spills, but Two Towers does host a few scenes where drama and tension is the medium more utilized. Not that I'm saying that this is a bad technique to use - by any means - but it does mean that although on the whole Two Towers is every bit as constantly entertaining as its predecessor, in a few of the scenes, it does fall perhaps ever so slightly short of Fellowship's impossibly high bench-mark. But guys, I really am WAY beyond nit-picking there!Verdict: 99% Fantasy-lovers and other cinema-goers alike: welcome back to Middle Earth. Put your feet up, grab a heady helping of popcorn, sit back and enjoy the next of the Rings flicks. It's going to be another very, very good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than The Return Of The King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unpopular opinion: this movie is the best of the trilogy. The Return Of The King might have had a better full movie but nothing can compare with the final hour of The Two Towers. The first hour was kind of meh, nice characters and good plot but it wasn't anything special. It got special though, when our characters made it to Helms Deep. The battle scenes were both awesome and intriguing. As the battle roared through ups and downs on of my favorite in cinema happens, Gandalf comes down the hill, this scene makes the movie for me. Frodo, Sam and Gollem were great. Awesome performance from Sean Astin and Andy Serkis. The whole trilogy had awesome moments such as Peregrin Took lighting the fire, or Boromir's death but this one was my personal favorite. Awesome trilogy, Peter Jackson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy greatness with one of the best sieges put on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus, Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.Where to begin with such a film? The characters, I guess. Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (I was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over ? it felt more like just one hour). Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts ? the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.The main action, of course, comes from the whole Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline, mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. Howard Shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie, often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. This IS Tolkien.Of course, the movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). I'll confess that I was close to tears at a couple of points ? the white light streaming onto the battlefield, the breaking of the dam at Isengard ? these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. The cast is flawless ? exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban, and especial mention to Bernard Hill. Nothing more can be said. A modern classic I'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tops the previous instalment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship has gone their separate ways. Some shed of their mortal coil, others to recover captured friends, while two Hobbits venture towards Mordor to destroy the ring.The skillful Kiwi director Peter Jackson along with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens top the previous instalment not just in scale, notably the battle scenes and attack on Helm's Deep, but in character development. The Two Towers is a near on perfect a fantasy epic with more digestible dialogue, which builds tension and momentum that complements the action with its chases and lengthy and difficult conflicts. Again Howard Shore's score is outstanding and heightens the emotional scenes and battles. The groundbreaking practical and digital visual effects, sets, costumes, props and locations are commendable. We have more weird and wonderful inhabitants of Middle- Earth as well as the introduction of new characters King Théoden (Bernard Hill), Miranda Otto is delightful as Eowyn and Gollum (CGI performed and voiced tremendously by Andy Serkis), is revealed fully. David Wenham is Faramir (brother of Boromir), worming calculating Wormtongue played by Brad Dourif and warrior Eomer is played by Karl Urban.Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas becomes closer. With a telling flashback of his Balrog fight Gandalf the Grey returns as more serious Gandalf the White. There's sagacious interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum as their journey to destroy the ring is met with obstacles. Aragorn's love for Arwen is tested. With the drama of Théoden being under a draining mind control spell there's also plenty of action, Rohan's soldiers slicing and dicing Orcs and Uruk-hai, and a showdown with Warg riders where Aragorn seemingly dies. There's also two great battles, an army of Tree Ents taking on Saruman, while Rohan's army along with warrior Elves go head to head with a countless Orc and Uruk-hai armies at Helms Deep.The extended version of The Two Towers like its predecessor improves on Jackson's theatrical cut, Sam uses his Elvish rope (which ties in with an extended scene in The Fellowship of the Ring), Merry, Pippin and Treebeard have more screen time and we find out how old Aragon actually is. Flashbacks reveal more of Faramir's family dynamics as well as more backstory to the sadly missed Boromir. As a fantasy sequel and midway part you couldn't ask for much more, excellent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lotr The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to the land of Middle-Earth, where one ring was created to rule nineteen rings, 3 to the elves, 7 to the dwarfs, 9 to men of the west, and the one ring to rule them all was created in the fires of MT. Doom and it was given to Sauron the leader of the evil forces of Middle- Earth. Then Sauron became greedy and decided to try to take control of the nineteen rings but an alliance between men, elves, and dwarfs decided to fight back and the king of Gondor Elendil was killed by Sauron and his Isildur took up his father's shattered sword and cut the ring off of Sauron's hand and the enemy of men was defeated and Isildur did not want to destroy the ring he wanted to keep the ring for himself. Then Isildur became a creature named Smeagol.Once they found Gandalf they headed toward Ednew. They found the king Theoden's mind was being poisoned by Saruman and Gandal frees Theoden's mind from Saruman then Theoden decides to move everyone to the keep ing the mountains when two of Theoden's scouts get ambushed by a warg which is a wolf and a bear hybrid, then Legolas saves one of the scouts by shooting the warg then slicing the throart of the rider then he says to Aragorn who heard the fight came to see what was going " It's a scouts", then Legolas goes up on a hill and sees the other wargs coming towards him and he starts shooting a the wargs then Aragorn, Gimli, and Theoden and his men started charging at the wargs and Legolas jumps on with Gimli and Gimli falls of the horse and a warg and Gimli was going to hit the warg with his battle axe but Legolas kills the warg before it can attack Gimli. Before the beginning of the battle Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are not sure that they will not win the battle against the Uruk-Hai. The Ents which are trees that can wal and talk like humans and the Ents are also known as "Shephard of the forest". So the ENts are deciding either join the war or staying neutral. Before the Battle of Helms Deep, Haldir, a high elves' general, and his army of high elves, came to support and Theoden asked him " how is this possible?" and Haldir answered, " I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell an alliance once formed between men and elves we fought and died together and we come to honor that alligiance once again." After the army of elves were on the walls the Uruk-Hai army showed p and an elderly man of Rohan drew back his bow along with the other men of Rohan but he could not hold the arrow fully drawn as long as the other men could so by accident he released the arrow and the arrow struck a Uruk-Hai swords man in the neck.If you want to see if Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Eomer, and Gandalf make it through the Battle of Helms Deep, so I advise you to watch Lord of The Ring The Two Towers. I recommend this movie to people who like mythical creatures and mythical based movies also people who enjoy blood, gore, and war movies. The special effects in the movie was really good especially the making of the Uruk-Hai's armor. Also the acting of Aragorn and Legolas was spectacular.The battle scenes in the movie I think were the best parts of the movie except when Haldir got killed in the Battle of Helms Deep by the Uruk- Hai general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloomier follow up to Fellowship of the Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people prefer this second part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the first. I am not one of those people. Where the first movie's strength was in its exploration of a magical fantasy world, this one is ? albeit necessarily ? more gloomy. I would guess that it's primarily thought highly of for two main reasons. Firstly, for its epic recreation of the battle for Helm's Deep and secondly for the character Gollum. These are two pretty persuasive reasons to be honest. The battle scene is truly massive in its scale and execution, with a lot of painstaking detail; while the character of Gollum is even more revolutionary in cinematic terms. Andy Serkis famously played the character with motion-capture devices all over his body but Gollum was a fully CGI created creature. It's pretty remarkable, therefore, that this character has so much believability and empathy. It's a testament to both Serkis acting and the artists who created him that this is so.Other than this, for me, The Two Towers suffers a little from neither being the start nor the end of the story. It doesn't have the variety of tones and locations of the first film, and overall it did get a little tedious at times. But this is in no way meant to be a criticism of Peter Jackson's efforts. This was after all merely a recreation of what was actually in the book; it's just that my sensibilities are not so in line with this one. But it's pretty obvious that this is another loving recreation from Jackson and his team; and, like before, it has a great ensemble of actors to do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers: The Darkest of The Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers. (2002) Welcome to the second part of the trilogy. Although not as good as the first, The Two Towers is definitely worth your time. The story is great. The FX are stunning as usual. The acting is quite awesome. What can I say? This movie also has a much darker quality to it.The evil nazg?ls are quite the terrifying sight. The sight of the 10,000 strong Uruk-Hai at Helm's Deep is indeed something else. The battle at Helm's Deep is quite awesome. Although this movie is not as action based as it's predecessor, it's still delivers.The acting here has more depth. Everyone delivers a good performance. Elijah Wood delivers a clinic. We also get to know Gollum. A very disturbed being that has been torn apart by the evil ring. His personality is shaken. Gollum is quite entertaining. His allegiance remains a mystery. At one point, Gollum gets into a argument with himself that is a very entertaining sequence of scenes here.Some problems are here though. The evil forces are not as menacing here as in the Fellowship. Don't get me wrong, they were still evil. Something was missing. Some Uruk-Hai's would get trounced without as even inflicting any pain to Aragorn and his fellow warriors. As much as Gimli is fun, the comedy gets a little bit old. Gimli in The Fellowship was more serious, here he is more comedy. Sometimes, comedy needs time off.The Last Word: Excellent. The Two Towers delivers well. If you liked The Fellowship of The Ring(Chapter 1 in the Trilogy), you will enjoy Chapter 2: The Two Towers. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like its two counterparts i find it almost impossible to give this lower than a ten. I would say however that this is the worst of the three but worst is not a word i like to use when dealing with such an Amazing film. The two towers is unsurprisingly visually stunning in every respect and we see the first Motion capture technology put in to film using gollum. After producing a outstanding wonderfully filmed first instalment peter Jackson had to follow up with something truly stunning, he did. The two towers follows of from where the fellowship left off and brings the film to the forefront with spellbinding special effects. The film follows the split up members of the fellowship and charts their journeys through middle earth all in the hope to do the most impossible of tasks and destroy the ring. Mortensen, bloom, Mckellen , wood and Sean Austin along with all other actors involved are again nothing short of perfect in portraying their characters to tell the story. The Two towers was the one film that we anticipated for a whole year and we were not let down with something as intricate and gripping as it was. Considering everything else in the film it is Andy Serkis that steals the show for the two towers in my view presenting the character of gollum in such an amazing way that you again become lost in the story. To add to the already finely done scenes before it Jackson produces the unforgettable battle of helms deep. This is without a doubt where the two towers became most gripping, emotive and visually stunning and the way it unfolds is truly, truly brilliant helping the 2nd instalment roll into the third. The two towers may in essence not be as good as Amon hen and Moria in the fellowship or the ride of the Rohirrim in the Return of the King but i feel it is still a true masterpiece of film making and kept the trilogy as strong as ever. The Two Towers in my view deserves nothing less than 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Darker Side of the Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of what made the last Lord of the Rings movie so great was its presentation. The light-hearted scenes were heart-warming and the darker moments were more suspenseful. The Two Towers takes a dark turn in the Lord of the Rings and uses it to be its primary mood. For the most part, this darker atmosphere pays off and helps the battles seem more impressive.The Fellowship is broken in this movie, but the journey must continue as The Two Towers continues right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off, like a true sequel. Almost instantly, Jackson introduces us to a crowd favorite character, Smeagol and Gollum. But why do we love this two part combo character? Maybe it has to do with the world-famous line "my precious...." Yes, that line alone makes this ugly imp-like creature one the audience can't help but love.Frodo and Sam don't have much a role in this movie, instead, The Two Towers puts the major focus around Aragorn, Legolus and Gimli, which I'm pretty thankful for. It's nice to see that after getting used to the silly hobbits that we get a movie that puts as much dedication towards the more serious part of the group. Gandalf also makes a return appearance and his changed attitude makes him more or less a more credible character this time around.The battle sequences in this movie are big and great. The first few battles that take place out in open fields are impressive themselves, but you won't know true battle scenes until the battle for Helms Deep. This sequence, combined with the Ents taking on Isengard is one of the most impressive epic battle combos ever seen in a movie. The CGI in The Two Towers is also incredible, no shot looks bad or ugly, with the exception of the brutal and nasty orcs and Uruk-Hai.Other new characters are brought into trilogy with The Two Towers and while it's nice to see some more good guys fight against the orcs, the movie lacks a spark to make them more lovable. The connection that Jackson establishes with these new characters exists, but it isn't used to the effect that he did with Smeagol and Gollum, which is a true shame.Regardless of this flaw that affects the movie more than it probably should've, The Two Towers is an great sequel. Some will say that this is the best of the Lord of the Rings movies, which in some ways is true. But compared to how great the first movie in this epic trilogy was, The Two Towers just doesn't create the same impressive feeling that Fellowship of the Ring left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most beautiful films of all time, 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is much more coherent and action-packed than the previous film in the trilogy. The action gets under way here, and the characters are separated and overcoming their own problems and battles as the time draws nearer when Frodo must succeed in accomplishing the huge task that he has been assigned. Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film. Like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers' uses the beautiful scenery to convey the burdens of the journey and the beauty that there is in the world gradually succumbing to the evil wizard. This film has a lot going for it that makes it succeed on so many levels.</fullReview>

I can't even imagine the extended edition. #15 on the top 250 is not doing this movie justice. It should be #5, just behind Return of the king. it is better than the fellowship of the ring.

		<shortDescription>A visual masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The journey to Mount Doom continues for only Sam (Sean Astin) and Frodo (Elijah Wood). The fellowship has been broken, but not entirely. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have stuck together in an attempt to regroup with the captured hobbits (Pippin and Merry). Darkness becomes stronger than ever in Middle Earth as Saruman (Christopher Lee) creates the army of Isengard and Sarun grows more powerful. The adventure grows more perilous in the 2nd part of the epic trilogy.What can be said more than this is singly one of the greatest films ever created? The acting is phenomenal in this film. The Fellowship showed great supporting roles, but nothing real strong from the main characters which The Two Towers is filled with. Elijah Wood really starts to express the power that the ring posses and Viggo Mortensen gives a performance unlike any other. Gandalf may have been wonderful in the previous film as well as this one, but the other characters really just start to shine in The Two Towers. You really start to see the characters transition into the hero.The story takes a whole new level in this film also. The adventurers experience Roahn, one of the kingdoms of man for the first time on film and are greeted with grief that has not been seen in the Lord of the Rings films yet. Not to mention the greatest battle scene ever put on film! The battle at Helm's Deep is the most phenomenal battle of all time. It is only a totally different league with battles from other movies like Braveheat or Gladiator. Overall, The Two Towers is one of the greatest films of all time. Enough said!! I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, essentially the Act 2 of a 3 Act trilogy structure, successfully continues the classic trilogy. Director Peter Jackson really knows what he's doing, as he expands on the characters we have come to love in the first film (The Fellowship of the Ring) - I was especially impressed with the "performance" by the CGI-character Gollum (the first CGI character that was realistic enough to me, whose bipolar-ism is explained in detail, making the audience understand how he became how he is and even to the point that you feel sorry for him) - Andy Serkis who portrayed Gollum really deserved at least an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Howard Shore continues a grand trilogy score with an addition of the melodic Rohan theme. A near perfect 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing Romantic Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" uses the best of contemporary and traditional movie magic for a rousing, romantic adventure tale of good vs. evil, loyalty and love. From touches of Ray Harryhausen's "Jason and the Argonauts" that were among my favorite movie movements as a child as the Ents and a couple of the monsters are charmingly hokey, to the seamlessly multiplying armored, costumed, hairy, made-up extras to the actor/rotoscoped combined astonishment of the twisted Gollum/Smeagle, it's all at the service of the story.Peter Jackson and company are wonderful at both closely hewing to the story yet skillfully cutting judiciously and adding clarifications that are in the spirit of the original, including using the appendix explanation of Aragorn's love affair with Arwen (incorrectly described as "doomed" by one critic -- well, if an eventual mortal life of 50 years together and four kids is "doomed" then many of us are doomed!)The mutual attraction with Eowyn is fit nicely into the "to be continued" cliffhanger as I think the double X chromosome viewers are left as eagerly awaiting the conclusion of what happens to Arwen and Aragorn as what happens to the Ring.David Wenham makes us almost forget Sean Bean as his late brother, and I just figured out that's Hugo Weaving with quite a hair weave as Arwen's disapproving dad. And of course excitingly heroic Viggo is absolutely hunky (and I've thought so since at least "Walk on the Moon"). I'll take this thrilling Battle of Helm's Deep over Saving Private Ryan for re-watching (with the second release of the DVD for the deleted scenes). No wonder there's now tours of the places in New Zealand the movie was shot because the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful, even if some of it is mattes.That's Sheila Chandra vocalizing in the effective music.

		<fullReview>The Two Towers really feels like a Medieval action-movie. Though Jackson deviates a bit more from the source-material than in the last film, in some ways this manages to enhance the film. I for instance was not distracted by Gandalf exorcising Saruman out of Theoden and actually felt it was ten times a cooler moment than in the books.Viggo Mortensen aka Aragorn now really takes charge for the first time and truly shines as the hero of this film. Gollum's addition to the movie also makes it a lot more powerful (he's so creepy). Unlike some, I have always enjoyed Gimli's excellent comic-performance.This is a solid films from start to finish and in my view the best LotR film. It even manages to out-do the follow-up "The Return of the King".Jackson has created a truly great series of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spectacular in every way! The only thing I did not like was the change to Faramir (-1 point). In the movie, he too is captivated by the Ring and begins in earnest to take Frodo and the Ring to his father, unlike the book. In the book Faramir chooses to "look the other way", but he still senses the evil of the Ring. In part we are led to believe that his training under Mithrandir (Gandalf) may have something to do with his knowing not to let his mind linger on the Ring, but rather shun it. He does not take Frodo captive with the intention of taking the Ring to his father, but rather frees Frodo after holding him at the waterfall hideout. I thought Jackson and co. could have stayed true to the book in this case without losing the effect of the Ring being seductive to everyone. Faramir's shunning of the ring also helps to effectively show the difference between he and his brother. Both having good intentions, but with Faramir being the more "open-minded" of the brothers he is thus able to recognize the danger of the Ring, and also know his own weakness in the face of such danger. Aragorn, too, chose to shun the ring, and he too could sense its evil. He was also something of Mithrandir's apprentice (not to mention the Elves'). So there was a logical explanation for them resisting the ring: their training alerting them to the potential danger and the need to avoid it. That could've been explained in lieu of this relatively small change in the story they chose to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. My favorite scene is when Legolas is "skate boarding" down a flight of stairs while he is shooting uruk-hai. If you're the type of person who loves action, adventure, or just plain want to see The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers come to life, then I suggest that you watch this movie. This movie is not just a regular movie that you see all the time, this movie is about honor, glory, and power and of course the One Ring. The Two Towers is a story that covers the One Ring as it travels closer to Mordor. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to go on a wild ride and join in the Lord of the Rings phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a definite step down from part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.spoilers followFor example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). It is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable "artistic license".As an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced WW2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. Wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the beginning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 fFangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the "goriest movie ever made" (1992's "Dead Alive"), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of "The Lord of the Rings" saga, which include "The Fellowship of the Ring" (2001), "The Two Towers" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner "The Return of the King" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since "Star Wars" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing "The Lord of the Rings" films. "The Lord of the Rings" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the "PG-13" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get "into" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and "The Enemy," who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ("live" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a "fellowship of the ring." There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called "The Lord of the Rings" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I 've been a true lover of epic movies for my past 30 years. I watched them as a cinema- admirer, as a sociologist that I am, but mostly as a simple, middle-ranked, common in mind and ideas person.What I expect from a movie is to CAPTURE me, to travel me inside its world, to have me. And this one certainly did.It 's a spectacular movie worthing every inch of celluloid, every single digital bit, every second, every frame spared for it. No doubt about this. This is subjective to tell, something you can see, something that everybody agree to.Here 's now my objective opinion (which of course is a subject to other objective opinions, and these are subjects to other objective opinions, and that's how -Thank God- the exchange of ideas functions):First the good ones: We have here a breathtaking plot, full of agony that's keeping the viewer's interest in truly high levels. In favor of this, are the gorgeous landscape shots, the unbelievable sets, the Oscar-worthing visual effects, and some excellent performances with Mr Viggo Mortensen having the leading one. I liked also the one of Mr Mc Cellan's -and the Gollum is something that a sociologist can really stop and take a careful look at. The dramatic finale with this never-seen-before heroic battle where the trio Aragorn- Legolas-Gimli is all the money, gives an enormous boost to the whole set-up. That's the moment when you will absolutely need your pop-corns!And the bad ones: The movie speaks of values like friendship, true love, dedication, courage. But there 's not once mentioned the name of God. Perhaps this is due to Tolkiens general "spirit", though such a movie that has been and will be seen by millions of people - especially young ones - should refer to the value of faith to God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of the first installment in this trilogy, I wrote:-----=====-----It has been tossed around in Hollywood for a long time. The very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. But how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from World War I?-----=====-----Well, once again, I do not claim to be a rabid fan (I read the books, I liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret to the process that lead to this masterpiece. Just as with the first installment, the cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a very good version of the second book's tale......as an adaptation, and as a stand-alone movie, I give this an "8/10" -- but as the bridge between Fellowship and Return... this movie is nearly flawless.The only faults I found in the movie deal with the story of Faramir. Had the story of Boromir been actually told in the Fellowship, then this butchering of the Faramir tale would not have been needed. Still, it manages to recover in the end from this failing and tell what is an engaging (if not a bit confusing) story of the path that the ring takes...Despite this one small shortcoming, the film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. It is just Act 2 of a 3 Act screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them</fullReview>

The Fellowship is back with Gandalf the White and the Ents come to life. Again, the extended/special edition is better. You'll get to see the cut scenes from the theatrical production. The battle at Helm's Deep was my favourite part of the film. Honestly, if you haven't gotten to see it, or even the extended/special DVD, I suggest you rent/buy it because it's worth your money!

		<fullReview>This was obviously going to be the more "boring" of the three movies, since it was only a midway step between the beginning and the end of the quest. It was therefore good of Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh to give the very significant speech of truth to Sam, who states the purpose of the journey right at the end. I have not given this movie a 10/10. In my mind, The Two Towers was a better movie than the first one, although further away from the Tolkienian idea of it, but it lacked a general "something", thus it did not deserve top marks. What I did notice in this movie was a general improvement in the actors. Even Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood - from various reasons unconvincing in the first movie from my point of view, put up a much better performance and a much more credible one. The "sliding down the stairs of Helm's deep on a shield" scene that Orlando had was still unconvincing and funny in a moment which should have been everything but that, but generally he did better.The Uruk Hai were probably one of the highlights of the movie in my opinion and obviously throwing Aragorn off the cliff was a good move for those people who have not yet read Tolkien - like for instance my brother. With two characters resurrected from the Dead - Gandalf and Aragorn and the clever alternative pictures of Eowyn and Arwen in Aragorn's mind, the plot already gains significantly.Again, from the point of view of the special effects - they were good because they did not show as special effects - even Gollum was very realistic! To answer the critics who believe that these CGI techniques should have been replaced by models - well, Peter Jackson did try to make everything that he could real life and scale model, but some things are simply undoable!I generally do not enjoy very much the Frodo-Sam-Gollum scenes because, while Sean Astin probably played his best there, Elijah Wood is still incomplete from my point of view. Faramir, although he was a disappointment for me as a person who read the books, is made more realistic, which fits the general description of the movies. I do understand why Mr. Jackson wanted this fate in store for him, but I still want to see Faramir as a younger and less important copy of Aragorn - a Numenorian.Since I judge this from the perspective of movie making, I will give it a 9/10 for the small defficiencies it had. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and Sean Astin however deserve 10s for their own performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellowship of the ring was a great start to the trilogy and Return of the King is the greatest film of its kind ever to be made so where does that leave The Two Towers. To run the story on nice and smoothly and keep everyone on the edge of their seat for The Return of the King it was important that The Two Towers made that happen and it did with flashing results. The most important thing about The Two towers was how much it was different to the Fellowship. More characterization is what makes this film a great one as we finally get to know more of Legolas, Merry and pippin and more of Aragon who is closer to becoming the King. The photography here is the most impressive out of the entire trilogy which leaves it for a great story which leads them to Helms Deep for probably the great battle ever to be screened on the big Screen.What will remember most for The Two Towers is that this is the film that introduced Gollum. We see a snippet of him in the Fellowship but here he comes out into the light like never before. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the one ring, Aragon, Legolas and Gimili follow the path to where Merry and pippin have been kidnapped as well as seeing some new characters thrown into the mix. Faramir who's brother is none other than Boromir from The fellowship continues his quest and of course the re-introduction to Gandalf the grey who has now become Gandalf the white. Together they join together to fight off the evil Saurman who intends on Sauron's orders to destroy middle earth and bring him the one ring to bring Sauron to complete strength.The Two Towers has everything you could probably want in a fantasy film and has more battle sequences than any of the films. Even though it's not a sequel, more a second chapter, it still exceeds it's critics but if I was to say which of the three films was the least watch able then it like asking a father who's his best child out of his family, you cannot simply ask a question, all I can say is that Lord of the Ring has brought a new way at looking at films which makes it a masterpiece in its own right.</fullReview>

The book was superbly written by JRR Tolkien to build up to the Helms Deep battle which is the high point of this movie. From there, the book follows further on to build up even further to the "great battle of our time", which is to be fought at Minas Tirith, Gondor, which is superbly directed by Peter Jackson. Meanwhile, Tolkien's greatest character comes to life further, and the film becomes even deeper and compelling than the first.

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers succeeds over the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' but to a certain degree.Now the Fellowship has been split apart, Aragorn, Gimli and Elf Boy are off doing their own thing with Rohan against Saruman. Merry and Pippin are off with the Ents (or talking trees), and Frodo and Sam must entrust their lives to Gollum in order to make it to Mordor.First thing I must talk of is the downs of this film. While the extended edition fleshes the characters out better, the theatrical film for 'The Two Towers' does not do that as best as possible. Some people, like Faramir are left mostly undeveloped. Don't worry, the extended cut takes care of this problem.While many people complain about Faramir's decision in the film, I actually kind of like that idea (since Frodo and Sam end up in close to that place anyway). The only problem with this change (or really addition) is that it seems like an idea that wasn't fully developed before filming it.Only several other things left me a bit mift with the film. One, was the fact that PJ didn't have the scenes in chronological order like I was hoping he would. That, in the end, doesn't matter really, since the inserting of different timeframes adds to the drama here.I hadn't read the book yet when I saw this movie, but I did know there was a showdown with Saruman at the end. Unfortunately, that has been saved until the Return of the King extended edition. I was also expecting from the film a sort of blueish - gray overtone, especially a rainy battle throughout the Helm's Deep sequence.While this is definitely the weakest of the trilogy, that is not to say its a bad movie. Its actually very good. Gollum is done with utmost perfection, getting even better in part 3. The acting is solid (though Legolas and Gimli need to stop the annoying puns. This takes away from the drama).As for the conclusion to the Helm's Deep sequence, simply breathtaking. It's an almost Biblical kind of ending, seeing Gandalf the White ride down with the army against overwhelming odds.This film is my 5th favorite movie.</fullReview>

What I mean by love is the wonderful scenes in this film. The beauty, the lust, it reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia in some way. The way Peter Jackson has the sun in the backround when Aragorn,Legolas, and Gimli (Yes I memorized all of their names) run towards it. And the acting, my god, when you talk about dramatic actors, you think of plain old dramas, not fantasy epics. Believe me this film can get dramatic, but is this film is as dramatic as the first one, well no.The first one is way better. The drama, the beginning of it all, the sadness, and there's something about the fight scenes that seem real in some way. The "Fellowship" focuses on the acting, not action, "The Two Towers" has useless, mindless action for the audience. Instead of focusing on the Hobbits and what these characters have to go threw to believe that they can destroy evil. What we get is a 45 minute action scene and Gandolf riding down a hill to save his friend. If this film kept the same pace of the first film, then I would give this film four stars. But here it is.I give this film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

The initial scenes as the audience falls through the inky blackness of the mines of Moria, following the epic duel between Gandalf and the inferno that is the Balrog, sets the tone for the rest of the film.The Fellowship of the first film has splintered into three groups ? Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and are now being tracked by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are slowly edging nearer to the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor where they can destroy the terrible burden that is the ring. In their quest they are aided by the wonderfully dichotomous character that is Gollum/Smeagol. And The Two Towers really is Gollum's film. He is a triumph of digital wizardry that the audience will both loathe and wish redemption for.The other major computer-generated characters ? Treebeard and his ilk ? are perhaps not so successfully believable; although few viewers could fail to be moved by the `last march of the Ents'. The settings are simply stunning; both the natural scenery of windswept plains and craggy mountains, and the built sets, such as the Kingdom of Rohan that echoes the Viking settlements of old.At the conclusion of the Battle of Helm's Deep, where (despite being a supposedly purpose-bred fighting force) the Uruk-hai are massacred by a handful of men, Gandalf prophesies that `the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin'. The audience is left to ponder what further horrors, heartbreaks and triumphs are in store for the adventurers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers" was an awesome film. Way better then the 1st film, although the 1st film was good too. Peter Jackson again shows talent in the 2nd installment of "Lord Of The Rings". Although, The 3rd film did win the '03 Oscars, I thought that the 2nd film was better then "Chicago". I mean, "Chicago" was a good movie, but everyone knows LOTR2 was better. Anyway, back to the review. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortesen, etc... return in the 2nd film with great performances. Great battle scenes.Teenagers, adults, and fans of the books will totally want to see this movie. Younger kids may get scared of some scenes.But this film was totally awesome and I like totally recommend it. If you haven't seen it yet, then dammit, you should! I give this movie an A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`I hope this is as good as the Fellowship'. That was my initial thought when I sat down to watch ?The Two Towers' at the cinema on the 18th December 2002. Thankfully this lived up to my expectations as much as the first movie did. Mr Jackson, like the plot, had continued where he had left off in ?Fellowship'. The Two Towers looks &amp; feels perfect. The pace is quick, but never rushed, the acting is excellent &amp; is never allowed to become to camp or ?hammy' &amp; it all looks beautiful, thanks to the use of New Zealand as Middle Earth &amp; some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on celluloid. The plot continues where the first film left us. Frodo &amp; Sam (Elijah Wood &amp; Sean Astin) have gone off alone to Mordor to try to destroy the Ring &amp; Aragorn, Gimli &amp; Legolas (Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys Davies &amp; Orlando Bloom) have decided to pursue the Uruk Hai who have captured Merry &amp; Pippin (Dominic Monoghan &amp; Billy Boyd) &amp; are taking them to see good wizard gone bad Saruman (Christopher Lee). Along the way we are introduced to more characters, some good, King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) his niece Eowen (Miranda Otto) &amp; her brother Eomer (Karl Urban) &amp; Faramir of Gondor (David Wenham) who is the brother the now dead Boromir. We also meet the scheming Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) &amp; Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis). We also meet new fantastical creatures such as Ents (giant walking trees) &amp; fell beasts (flying lizards that the Nazgul now ride). The film has a plethora of wonderful set-pieces that take your breath away. There are the wonderfully imagined Ents, 2 fantastic skirmishes between Riders of Rohan &amp; Orcs, one of which involved large wolf like creatures called Wargs. Then there is the battle at Helm's Deep (The fortress stronghold of the people of Gondor). This has to rank as one of the greatest battles ever seen on film. It truly does take your breath away when you see an army of 10,000 Orcs marching towards a fortress built into a mountain, manned by only 300 soldiers &amp; 150 Elves. The battle scenes are intense, violent &amp; fairly graphic, but thankfully the violence is never gratuitous.But all of that is almost forgotten in comparison to the single greatest special effect ever to grace the silver screen. Gollum. Actually, to call Gollum a special effect is being unfair to Andy Serkis. Because, although what you see on screen is a computer generated image, Gollum is brought to life by the magnificent Serkis. His voice, movement &amp; performance are what brought the best out of WETA when they were designing Gollum &amp; without him they wouldn't have created this phenomenon. And this creation is so good that you forget the he is CGI. Not only this, he steals every scene he is in, whether he is the Gollum seen in the opening attack on Frodo &amp; Sam to the cowering, snivelling subservient wretch that is Smeagol. He also provides the highlight of the film. When the personalities of Gollum &amp; Smeagol come head to head in a moonlight confrontation, it is like being hit in the heart with a 500lb emotional sledge hammer. This is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone on the planet. My only gripe is that the magnificent Andy Serkis wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his powerhouse performance. See this film, I implore you all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little less than totally spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was inevitable that the crew behind this trilogy would take some liberties with Tolkien's work and here they are.I was frustrated with the movies journey into the appendices of Tolkien and slower pace than the first. A few elements were also seemingly unnecessary like Legolas's efficiency with the bow seems to change just for the sake of one scene. I mean, sure, war is unpredictable, but it could definitely been set up better. The story of Aragorn and Arwen is a prominent part of the film which is in the written trilogy's appendices and it seems to slow the movie down. Elrond speaks to Arwen for a long time in one scene, but his point can be reduced to one sentence. Also the movie doesn't catch up with the book, due to all the extra content, and ends well before the source.But despite this, and a few other things, the movie is very well made. And it can be looked as not an adaptation of the books, but as an adaptation of Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth. That way, all the extra anecdotes don't seem so out of place. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie as much as the first. It was a good movie still and kept me watching it. But there were too many battle seens in this movie. I really though that the guy who did Gollum's voice did a really good job. They really matched his face good with Gollum too. The precius thing was funny and cute at the same time. Gollum was sure ugly, my friend thought he was the cutest thing ever. I give this movie a A-. Everyone did a very good job just like they did in the fellowship of the ring. I am just really into these movies now. I couldn't wait for the 3rd one to come out and when it did i went to the theater as soon as i could. Overall this was a pretty good movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy proves itself as an amazing feat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a movie which, surprisingly, took together the countless elements that made its predecessor so great, trimmed and added, and came up with a result better than the first movie. The epic tale of the Fellowship of the Ring continues, though the Company be broken. The One Ring must be destroyed.The second part of JRR Tolkien's gigantic novel ("Six books, three parts, one novel," in his own words) is less true to the source material than the first movie. This is because the details and facts in the Two Towers are more difficult to translate onto film. The emotional impact of the film really hits you. There are epic scenes of huge battles, some in slow-motion, and the music helps a lot. Besides that, there are the tearful scenes, and the nightmarish mood swings of Gollum under cover of darkness. All are spellbinding, and all viewers are powerless to resist.The acting is as good as it gets. Elijah Wood plays the Ringbearer Frodo very well, though the character himself I find a bit annoying. Nonetheless, Frodo is meant to be courageous and reluctant to carry on with the quest, and that is what Wood portrays as well as is possible.Viggo Mortensen is still the worn Ranger Aragorn, although he is halfway changed in preparation for the final movie. He is essentially the same character, and the audience hangs on his every word and every action.Ian McKellen will always be Gandalf in my memory. Reading the book, I can imagine McKellen as Gandalf and no one else will fit. But this time around he is Gandalf the White. His acting is flawless, and conveys a sense of unlimited wisdom and compels trust, and you think "Gandalf will find a way to fix it," with every obstacle that the characters face, and the characters who look up to him think the same way.The special effects are even better than in the previous movie, either that or they have a better chance to shine. Certainly the addition of Ents and more Orcs will be a better showcase for the technology than a few orcs and a Balrog from the first. Regardless, the effects are mindblowing. The highlight is Gollum, who is just perfect. His expressions are swift to change, but there is no flaw to mar those changes. The voice is superb, and Gollum is my personal pick for the star of the movie.The only problem that might be present in the Two Towers is the switching from location to location. It is a bit annoying at certain points, more so than the other two movies. But it's just a small flaw amongst a sea of success, so many will not notice. The Two Towers is an amazing movie. The Lord of the Rings trilogy gets better and better with each movie. The Two Towers is true to the book, and a thrilling tale of action and emotion. But the One Ring remains in Middle-earth, waiting to be found. But Sauron will have to wait for the Return of the King to get another chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your Favorite Scenes (in all three movies)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this in the TT section because one of my favorite scenes in all of the three movies is during Helm's Deep, when the Uruk-hai are banging on the ground and they show the women and children scared. It really gave a sense of the fear, and that's what makes a great movie: allowing the audience to feel the scene rather than just see it.Another favorite scene is from the extended edition, the scene with Boromir and Faramir. "Remember today, little brother. For today, life is good..."The extended edition is so unbelievably amazing. I can't wait until ROTK's extended edition. Hopefully there will be as much extended footage as in TT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent presentation, but rewritten by orcs. Garh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We must be very happy that such a monumental effort was put into a (fairly) faithful presentation of the written version. However, there are some aspects which cause discontent. First, the "rewriting" of a classic, especially this one which was so masterfully told in the first place by J.R.R.Tolkien, is the work of orcs. Related to this is a diminishing of the character of Aragorn. He is presented as somebody who rises to leadership more by accident than by anything else. His faithfulness, and the dominance of his character, are dragged in the dirt by the limpness of his presentation in the movie. It isn't because of Viggo Mortensen's acting - that is first-rate. Rather, those who prepared the script for the movie caused awkward damage to a masterpiece of creation. Did they not believe that a character like Aragorn could be believed by innocent moviegoers? Halbarad of the Dunedain has also become the captain of a troop of elvan archers (and an Elf himself), which doesn't arise from the conditions of Middle Earth presented by Tolkien - the Elves all had work enough to defend their own homes! In short, many of the scenes of the movie have been "written down" to a limper, less-interesting and less-inspiring story which contains inconsistencies that the book does not. However, in spite of that, I enjoy the chance to SEE Middle-Earth and some of its stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dramatic departures from the text, but no less wonderful for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**It's difficult to imagine what these posts would have looked like had I written them when I first viewed these films. Now, I'm writing them having seen the extended editions of FOTR and TT and the advantage of having seen ROTK more times than I care to admit. I know that some of the issues I had with TT were resolved in ROTK - the main one being the apparent character assassination of Faramir. In the book he rejects the ring utterly, yet in the film he comes close to falling under it's spell. However, the extended edition and ROTK highlights the nature of his relationship with Denethor and things start to make much more sense.TT also sees the introduction of my favourite character in the books - Eowyn. Although I enjoyed Arwens extended pony ride with Frodo, I'm not sure why Jackson felt he needed another feisty female when Eowyn was waiting in the wings. Fortunately he came to his senses and Arwen went back to hanging around looking pretty and pale. I've never understood how Aragorn can choose Arwen over Eowyn, but hey, his loss is Faramir's gain.Miranda Otto was absolutely superb as Eowyn. She was strong, yet vulnerable, beautiful and cold, everything she should have been. Her scenes with Wormtongue really stood out for me, and the dialogue that belonged to Aragorn in the text fitted well in the scene over Theodred's death bed. And I can't talk about Eowyn without mentioning Theoden. Bernard Hill broke my heart completely in both this and ROTK. His rejuvenation by Gandalf, his love for his niece, his internal conflicts, and above all, his grief for his son. Bernard made Theoden a better man than he was in the book - where he comes across as a reflection of Denethor without the rings corrupting influence. His tendency to doom and self destruction is still there, but Aragorn's influence tempers that.Merry and Pippin continued to delight me as faithful portrayals of their characters from the book. They make a refreshing contrast from the heavier stuff with Sam and Frodo. And of course, Gollum. Watching Smeagol struggle to overcome his demons and ultimately failing is gut wrenching. And considering that he's a CGI character that's incredible. Unlike the awful Jar-Jar, one completely accepts Gollum as a real person. Even though he doesn't like po-tay-toes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of The Rings: The Film and the Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since hitting our screens three years ago, the phenomenon that is The Lord Of The Rings has brought an enchanting tale of magic, wizardry, elves, dwarfs and hobbits to life. Four years ago, a virtually unknown Kiwi director was on the brink of something wonderful. Peter Jackson had been concentrating his efforts on The Lord Of The Rings for years and desperately needed a blessing from a major studio. That blessing came with New Line Cinema, a studio that invested $270 million as a budget for Jackson. With this budget, Jackson began a mammoth 15-month shoot in order to get the filming for all three films done in one go. The amount of editing and special effects put into the film after filming was enormous. The trilogy contains approximately 1200 special effect shots, more than any other film in history. Jackson and his co-writers, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens were aware they were making films for the hard-core Tolkein fans and tried to stay true to the books, but eventually due to timing, some scenes had to be cut considerably in order for the films pace to keep moving and the story to keep flowing. They have done an excellent job of condensing more than 500 pages of text into a script that doesn't feel choppy, uneven or rushed. The Two Towers' vast scope ranges from the snowy unspoiled peaks of Middle-earth, which was shot entirely in New Zealand, to the city of Isengard, a combination of models and computer-generated imagery. Our hero, Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his quest in destroying the evil One Ring that his uncle passed on to him. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) departs on his quest across the plains of Middle-earth to salvage what's left of mankind; he embarks on this with Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies). Jackson makes a relatively small part of Tolkein's book into the centrepiece of his film; the battle of Helm's Deep. A thirty-minute spectacle, where even a bit of comedy creeps in. While an impressive use of special effects gives the battle a distinct charm, Jackson does not let the computer graphics overpower the human element of what's going on. The sheer size of the sequence is awe-inspiring in particular the Orcs' raising their spears, which seem to go on for miles. Jackson has managed to stage and shoot this scene with extreme clarity. It's not that Jackson is succeeding on an epic scale here, it's that he's working on a scale most directors wouldn't dare do. Tolkein purists who didn't like the changes made in The Fellowship of the Ring will most likely be outraged at the amount of changes made in the second instalment. The Two Towers differs much more than Fellowship purely because it's stuck in the 'middle chapter' section of the trilogy. Jackson has managed, however, to keep the tone and spirit of Tolkein's The Lord of the Rings throughout the second film. Jackson has used The Lord Of The Rings to re-invent fantasy for the cinema and with The Two Towers it seems very clear that we are in the midst of one of the great achievements in fantasy filmmaking and in epic filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again, magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So its 1 year later and we all own the first film on DVD...or should do.Everyone has high expectations for this film and by god were those met. The perfomances that made the first film so beleiveable are all here as are the special effects and amazing locations. This film however is the worst out of the trio. And its down to the fact that too much time is given to tree beard. Although he was done very well and he is an important part in the story...even i hav to admit (and being a mega lotr fan) he did waffle on a bit. Another bad criticism I have is that Gollum, although done well didnt meet my expectations. In fact the model of Gollum in this film is different to the one in the first film. I dont know what it is about him but I felt that Gollum could have been better. Its probably because he's so babyish and in the third film he does get alot better because the evil side comes out. The battle of Helms Deep is ground breaking in every way and is held together by strong performances by Viggo Mortensen and Bernard Hill. Whereas Legolas the elf only seems to be in the film to do cool stunts and Gimli to bring more comedy into the serious situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers proceeds from where FOTR left us. It starts with a flashback of Gandalf's fall in Moria and exactly what happened. Then the movie goes on...three hours of absolute movie magic. The Two Towers, contrary to my fears (that it might not live up to my expectations after watching the trailer) turned out to be brilliant. PJ, again at his best! I went to watch this movie at a theatre twice and I wanted to watch it over and over again. Man, again LOTR on the top! I cried so many times (I cried less in FOTR and much more in ROTK). And what was the most inspiring was Sam's dialogue towards the end of the movie in Osgiliath.The movie again is pure greatness...it was so brilliant. It was a long wait from FOTR to TTT though. But worth the wait. I loved every bit of the movie so much.I was disappointed with the Oscars. I thought this time it was really unfair that the Two Towers did not get recognition for its brilliance. And Chicago (that crappy movie) won Best Picture! I was really shocked.The Two Towers again makes us get lost in Middle Earth with hours of bliss.A movie worth watching...again 10/10!!!</fullReview>

The debate scene is the stealer but all his interactions with Frodo &amp; Sam are laudable. (I was disappointed that the "Sneaking!" sequence was omitted. It's appears too late in the 3rd film &amp; sadly pales in comparison to the animated version. And the written version, naturally.) I also like Pippin &amp; Treebeard. Unfortunately the other characters don't share the same appeal &amp; I've never been a fan of huge battles. Helm's Deep goes on forever! The Aragon/Arwen relationship doesn't excite either.

		<shortDescription>Amazing in many ways.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very reluctantly came to view the first installment, Lord of the Rings, Fellowshp of the Rings, and during the first hour it immediately picked up my interest for a number of reasons. At the end of the first film, Frodo Baggins packs up his companion, Samwise Gamgee, and they are off in a boat. I realized then that it was not enough to leave them on their own, but I wanted to find out what would happen not only to these two Hobbits but the rest of the characters who I had come to like very much. Yesterday I rented Twin Towers and was going to watch an hour only, but LOR is very much like eating popcorn..... once you start it is hard to stop.I am writing not so much to speak of what happened and about the way it was directed and the actors who were involved, but the way the story affected me personally. Let me give you just two examples. In the scene where Gandalf the White comes into the grand hall to try to resurrect Theoden, the king of Rohan. When he is finally able and Theoden comes out of this spell and is restored, I cried. My mother, for the final four years of her life was robbed like the king.........only hers was not a spell it was Parkinsons...... How I wish I could have had someone come in and do that for her.......to restore her...... In the scene where the stronghold is being overrun by the forces of evil, the character Haldir, is fatally wounded and Aragorn comes to him in his dying moments, to try to bring some comfort. I was reminded of how many are dying just like that in Iraq and the many others who have in the past suffered the same consequences as a result of war. My sister placed a perspective this morning on the emotions I felt, as I watched Twin Towers, by saying that Tolkien envisioned this when he wrote this epic.....of the many struggles, the sacrifice, the nobility that is shown in the face of overwhelming odds. I am hopeful to see the final installment this weekend.I believe this is in fact the greatest epic that has ever been done on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fish &amp; Chips" scene brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say that the "fish &amp; chips" argument between Gollum and Samwise in this film is one of my favorite pieces of dramatization.It works because the scene reveals so much about the characters and the underlying themes of the story, without the whole thing sounding like a self-conscious English Literature essay. With Gollum having total spasms about the way Sam's "ruining" the food, and Sam stuck in the traditional ways of Hobbit cooking, the interaction between the conflicting character points of view is brilliantly realized in a novel and interesting way. It's in scenes like this where dramatization really works best.On the other hand, I have to say in contrast that the big "important stories" speech in both the white city scene and at the end when the two hobbits are walking off is one of the worst pieces of heavy-handed moralizing I've ever heard. It sound really labored and forced and really doesn't fit the context of the situation too well at all.The Helms Deep battle is certainly a highlight of the movie - in fact the whole trilogy! It's very well set-up and executed (pardon the pun!); while providing some great character interaction. I personally enjoyed the comic relief moments with the rivalry between Gimli and Legolas. Legolas' style at mounting his transport was very impressive. Some of the best character moments in this movie is when Frodo defends Gollum to Samwise, and also Merry and Pippin play off each other very well while being held by the Orcs, then running and meeting Treebeard. And the final battle of the Ents with Sauroman is a great climactic moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second part of the best trilogy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with a return to Moria where Gandalf and the Balrog are at a standoff. This familiar scene, however, takes a new twist and instead of following the remainder of the fellowship to their grief, we follow Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) into the forgotten chasms below even Moria. Before we can learn his ultimate fate, we are brought back to where we left off in The Fellowship of the Ring.Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) have made little progress on their trek towards Mordor where they must return the one ring to the fiery pits from whence it came. Frodo is falling more and more under the control of the ring and the spirits of both of the hobbits is waning in light of the incredible length of the journey thus far and the unknown distance they must still travel. It is not long, though, before they run into the ring's owner prior to Bilbo- Gollum.Gollum is a wonder to behold. Every bit of hype about the complexity, believability and dramatic effect of this digital character is deserved. As in the books, Gollum is an immensely important character to the movies and there was no room for error when presenting him onscreen. As he continues on the journey with Frodo and Sam, Gollum continues to be a dramatic entity like none other and his motives are never entirely clear.Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are hot on the trail of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). As you may recall, the two hobbits were captured and whisked away by the evil Uruk-Hai. The trail leads the three into the land of Rohan which is in turmoil under the weak leader ship of King Theoden. Theoden is a thin shadow of his previous self, we learn, and we discover this situation is not what it seems. Through the help of the malicious Grima Wormtounge (Brad Dourif), Saruman (Christopher Lee) has gained control of Theoden in order to weaken the kingdom of Rohan to insure its defeat in the war waged by Sauron.Merry and Pippin, it turns out, have escaped the Uruk-Hai but have come under the control of another, less malicious force- an ent by the name of Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davis). Treebeard is a walking, talking tree that, at first, mistakes the hobbits for orcs. This storyline is the weakest and was the most cut up of the plot lines. It will be restored in the upcoming extended edition however.This movie is an epic in itself and the plot outlined above all unfolds in the first 45 minutes of the three hour film. Needless to say, you should not, under any circumstances, attempt to watch this film without seeing The Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson made the genius decision to pickup in this film where the first left off and spends absolutely no time recapping the previous adventures of these characters. Instead, he fills the entire three hours with new plot, more character driven story and epic adventure and action. The whole film culminates in the most viscerally engaging and technically detailed on-screen battle ever witness. The battle of Helm's Deep will most likely leave you breathless.Jackson and his crew have crafted a living universe here. Every costume, every weapon, every plant and every creature looks as if it belongs. This is Middle-earth. The cinematography is darker in this film (due to the obvious shift in tone) and the direction and camera work is just as gorgeous as in the first film. There are no weak links in the chain of actors that have been asked to bring the characters of Middle-earth alive. Each and everyone lives and breathes their characters.What The Lord of the Rings series comes down to is a masterfully epic story about a hobbit. While these movies could have been overwhelmed by special effects and CGI, Jackson understands the soul of the books were not in the creatures and the battles, but in the characters that have to do things that go against their very nature in order to bring harmony back into their world. The Two Towers is a perfect middle section to this trilogy and, like The Fellowship of the Ring, leaves us with a cliff-hanger and a good reason to go see the next film. When all is said and done, these three films will forever be discussed as part of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to see this movie, because I thought the first one was brilliant. I think the special effects were some of the best ever shown on our TV screens. I was not so keen on the constant fighting in the movie and preferred the first sequel because it had more adventurous scenes and introduced you to some fascinating creatures, such as the elfs and of course the hobbits. I loved the hobbits and thought they were so funny, their jokes and fun sense of humour can make anyone feel cheerful again. I was a bit disappointed that the women in the movie didn't play such a big part. Awren played by Liv Tyler and Galadriel played by Cate Blanchett should have had bigger parts in the movie. I love Orlando Boom he is my favourite and wish he could appear in more films, he's drop dead gorgeous. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The large battle scene(you know what i'm talking about) is easily the best action scene ever, or at least that i've seen. No sequel let down this time, as the three were shot together so the form of director Jackson never strayed. Combining unbelieveably real special effects with solid acting, epic battles and the lovely scenery that is middle earth (nah, really new zealand)the two towers along with it's sibling films is arguably one of the great films in history.Everything about the movie is fantastic, it simply blows you away.

		<fullReview>Although it is nowhere near as enchanting and breathtaking as FELLOWSHIP, THE TWO TOWERS is an exciting sequel that (more or less) lives up to the hype. It is a very good movie.Once again, Peter Jackson has done a great job of direction. despite a partly animated performance, Andy Serkis deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance as Gollum/Smeagol. Liv Tyler also deserves special recognition for her touching portrayal of Arwen. Her scene with Elrond is a testament to how good of an actress she really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all of the LOTR trilogy. They are amazing and wonderfully done by Peter Jackson. This one, however, i find is probably the most challenging of all of them. I say this because it is the second of the movies and has to live upto the first one, it clearly doesn't follow the movie legend that sequels aren't as good as their originals. The other thing I love about the two towers is that it has to bridge a gap between the first and the third, it has to establish more new characters,that is not an easy feat. For example Faramir, Gollum, Eowyn, Eomer and Theoden all have to be established to be carried on to the third movie. Sure it isn't action packed like Return of the King but it was definetly the hardest to pull off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's true. Return of the King may win more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge "The Two Towers" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on "Zulu"- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are "some things worth fighting for", when Merry tells Pippin that there "won't be a Shire" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that "the sun has gone down in the West" this film could be entitled not the "Two Towers" but "the Twin Towers". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all the three episodes of the "Lord of the Rings" saga, and "The Two Towers" is the one that I prefer. The battles, the courage, the emotion it contains are the greatest. What about the strong Eomer, who protects his beloved Rohan even if exiled? What about his sister Eowyn, so thin, so pale, but also so determined?I am not saying that "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Return of the King" are less visually and emotionally powerful. I mean, the first lacks many of my favourite characters -- Theoden, Eomer, Faramir, Aldir (!!), whereas the third is mostly about Frodo: my poor Legolas just says three or four lines. I admit that maybe my delusion is due to the great expectations I had about the third episode. However, "The Two Towers" never betrays Tolkien's fans, even if they could look at it endlessly. I love "The Lord of the Rings", and I love the second film more than the others. It is just a personal opinion, but who will forget the battle of Helm's Deep?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gollum is done masterfully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally! The wait to see Gollum is over, after merely a snippet appearance in the first film. And I have to admit, they did him justice. These films are so far fetched (the whole wizards and warriors thing) that if the level of effects drop for just a second, the entire story can eat itself because the viewer is pulled out of that world. Bad effects can make or break a film like this.Luckily for Peter Jackson, the verdict is in, and his team did an EXCELLENT job every frame of this movie. This is done better than my imagination when reading the book! Every frame belongs in a museum, as true works of art. Effects are amazing - character work rivaling Yoda and other digital characters we've seen, and pushing the envelope. Every setting is pristine. Every facet was done properly, and the viewer is immersed the whole time. I'm very impressed with the level of work this New Zealand crew was able to crank out, and will check out future offerings from the "Weta" kiwi contingent based on this film alone. Technically flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Tower'ing Achievement But Has A Cracked Foundation. * * * (Out Of Four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring" started a craze within Hollywood over the buzz the series created. The follow-up, "The Two Towers" builds up on it, but in the end leaves us wanting a real ending. The film improves on it's action content, mostly within it's last third act, which we are shown an army of minions battling those against them in Helm's Deep, a last resort for poor villagers surrounding it from the evil of Sarumon. The film takes us on varied journeys of the now broken up fellowship and what each of the fellowship endure to fight for what they believe in: a little hobbit by the name of Frodo, who now we see is being taken down slowly by the ring and those who were taken down as well by it, in the form of a little creature known as Gollum, a computer generated creation so lifelike and realistic, you take it as just another actor within the film. The film has stunning cinematography and takes the best of New Zealand (The location of the filming) for it's depiction of Middle-Earth. The film, however, may wow audiences with the added action but may leave them lost in a haze from the hard, fast-paced plot setting as new characters, locations, and moments are thrown in left and right. But it's not too much to worry about if you stay focused on the story and don't get overwhelmed from the action. The coordination with the film is put nicely and smoothly, except towards the end of the action where areas and scenes are disoriented and confusing, but it shouldn't matter too much. If there was one problem with the film it'd be for the ending. The film leaves you wanting more, which is a classic film gimmick, but by "wanting more" it's meant as wanting a more understandable ending. We're left seeing the Hobbits on their way to Mount Doom through a forest with no reasoning on the others (That is too plausible). But aside from the lackluster ending, the film leads gracefully onto act three of the series and gets you wanting more so bad it'll eat you inside...like a little ring we might know of...

		<fullReview>I find this film a better film to watch than FOTR. Some might complain about the pacing - true; but with Gandalf fighting the balrog, the battle at Helms Deep, and the attack of those werewolf thingies? And overall better epic scope than FOTR; oh did I forget to mention Gandalf and the riders of Rohan trodding down the slope? Fantastic!I didn't like Sam Wisegamgee's VO at the end though. There's also a hint of their optimistic, yet slightly sick and desperate conversation about being in storybooks at the end though.The writers and PJ don't end like the TTT book does. They saved the real ending for TTT for ROTK, and if you watch ROTK - which is also a great film; you'll be impressed as to how they managed to rechronologize it along with the battle of Minas Tirith. Anyway, if they ended it this way for the TTT movie adaptation, it wouldn't have felt right. It would have made the movie overly longer and was gonna stray away from its main plot's resolve, and other issues.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath taking display of everything cinema stands for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many ways to go wrong when making a film that starts in the middle of a story, losing your target audience, having people forget the original film and so on. However Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Barry M. Osborne and so on tackled these problems with tremendous dedication and overcame them without even making it look hard.The Two Towers is an exciting, exhilarating, fast-paced and emotional rollercoaster of ups and downs that can leave your heart in your stomach or your stomach on the living room floor. It's staggering characterisation that is carried on superbly from the first film, the moving and heart felt performances from each and every cast member- right down to the extras with less 2 seconds screen time, is unfalteringly profound, and only overshadowed by the sheer magnificence of the Helm's Deep Battle scene, which i really do believe to be, at least one of, the greatest battle scenes in cinematic history.Not only is this film heart-wrenchingly powerful, in the most blood-pumping-around-your-body-at-100-miles-an-our way but it's mixture of vigorous strength and endearing weakness, must truly make this one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After my first viewing, this film left me virtually paralyzed. After a few subsequent viewings and gaining some objectivity, I'll concede it's not quite as good as The Fellowship of the Ring, but still sublime.The main reason is that it's uneven. Rather than just one journey featuring nine characters, we now have three storylines, each covering the exploits of a third of the Fellowship. The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli thread is the real meat of the film, and the most satisfying. The Merry/Pippin thread is the slightest, and while it does contain some good moments, there's also some borderline-propaganda moral grandstanding that's always grated a bit. The Ents are decently executed, but not industry-redefining. It's the Frodo/Sam segments that are always the dubious ones. They're stilted at the start, cliched at times on the way through, and veer into saccharine territory at the end.However, if the treatment of the returning cast is imperfect, the new cast members are dead on. Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Wormtongue, and Faramir all work perfectly in their parts, making the dramatic experience of this movie very different from FOTR. Sean Bean's Boromir is sorely missed, but his absence doesn't kill the movie. The one complaint about all the new blood though, is that they seem to cut into Gandalf's screen time. This is critical, as Ian Mckellen's peerless performance was one of the greatest things FOTR had going for it, and his greater amount of screen time is the deciding factor in why I still think it's the superior movie.The centerpiece of The Two Towers, however, is obviously the battle at Helm's Deep. It takes up virtually the film's entire third act, and contains not only some of the best large-scale action ever filmed, but also, miraculously, a lot of the film's best dialogue. The surfeit of sword and arrow action is impressive, no doubt, but Viggo Mortensen's commanding performance elevates it, and Bernard Hill's ingeniously lit, deeply moving monologue before the battle should have netted him an Oscar nomination.And then, of course, there's Gollum. Andy Serkis gives perhaps the film's best performance from beneath a layer of pixels. Despite a few scenes where the illusion is more apparent than others (never obvious, mind you), but the vast majority of the time, it's a watershed for digital characters. Gollum makes you forget Jar Jar Binks ever existed, especially in the inspired schizophrenia scene.On the rare occasions when it's bad, it's mediocre at worst. When it's good -- which is most of the time -- it's masterful. In the end, The Two Towers is an excellent film.</fullReview>

Before that, Gollum leads Frodo and Sam to the Black Gates of Mordor. They get there and they use a special way 2 get in, or a so called, secret passageway. Well, you see Gollum has 2 sides of him, good and bad. The bad side really want its precious ( the ring ) the good side wants 2 be nice to master and not hurt him. But at the end, both sides of Gollum agree to get some women to kill them, so the good gollum went back on his word and Will be punished!!** " YOU SHALL NOT PASS " - Gandalf ( LOTR : TFOTR, LOTR: TTT ) **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the already brilliant "Fellowship of the Ring".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002)THE GOOD:--Peter Jackson's directing is once again, just WOW. His brilliant understanding of both character and visual intensity is just absolutely astounding. Someone throw this awesome Kiwi an Oscar, or three.--There's heaps of action in "The Two Towers", only it is more focused than the action in "The Fellowship of the Ring". What I mean by this is that this sequel's action sequences serve the purposes of the story and are extremely necessary whereas with "Fellowship" you could've cut out maybe one or two of the action sequences and it wouldn't have changed the story. In "Towers" it is vital. That's not saying that the action in "Fellowship" was bad, it's just that "Towers" is much more an advancement on the story and it is where everything really starts to go off in the trilogy. The battle of Helm's Deep must get a special mention, it was truly terrific and one of the most masterfully constructed fight sequences to ever grace the silver screen. I was in suspense the whole time, especially at the beginning. I was horrified when the Uruk-Hai were banging their huge stick-things on the mud and it was making that horrible racket and then we cut to seeing the reactions of the women and children - that was very scary, and put you right in the moment. The battle itself kicked some ass and then some, but also had that appropriate sense of dread.--The characters in this episode of Lord of the Rings begin to develop more, as do the relationships between the characters. The closeness of Sam and Frodo begins to deepen and their chemistry is terrific. Arwen and Aragorn's romantic life takes a twist when Aragorn decides "it was a dream" and breaks up with her, which allows the audience to look a little deeper into Arwen. We see how much strength she had got from Aragorn and how their breaking up has changed her as a person. We also get to see how much Arwen is willing to do for her people. I also really felt the connection between Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli in this film as three friends who are close and depend on each other. --I've mentioned how the character relationships improve above, but "The Two Towers" showcases one of the most developed and enthralling characters ever brought to the screen, and that is Gollum. He is a confused creature, once like a hobbit. He has two personalities to him, which at times can be funny but in the long run Gollum is a tragic figure. He struggles throughout the film with wanting to return to his former self (Smeagol) and his desire to have the One Ring returned to him. A fascinating character, brilliantly brought to the screen by the Oscar-worthy Andy Serkis.--As usual with The Lord of the Rings movies, the visual side of things is stunning. The visual effects are breathtaking, especially the completely CGI Gollum and the effects during the Helm's Deep battle (the wolves of Isengard were also extremely impressive). The cinematography was also incredible, just look at that stunning shot of Gandalf and the Riders of Rohan charging down the hill and into the battle of Helm's Deep - truly astonishing!--Howard Shore once again delivers on the musical front, giving us a more Celtic feeling to the score, particularly during the beautiful Rohan scenes. The Helms Deep score was terrific also, as is the score for the Arwen/Aragorn or Arwen/Elrond scenes, very beautiful work.--I've always loved the character of Saruman and the location of Isengard and their armies and that is what "The Two Towers" is all about. It gives us a wrap-up with the Isengard story so we really move onto the humongous stuff with the Mordor armies in "The Return of the King". Though more of Saruman would've been nice, I appreciated that this film took the time (though it never gets boring and never wears out its welcome) to give Isengard and the evil White Wizard a good send-off.THE BAD:--There was pretty much nothing extremely bad to pinpoint about the film, though it did have its visual flaws and cheesy moments.RATING:10/10 - An improvement over the already brilliant first film, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is nothing short of a masterpiece.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Braveheart (6/10) Gladiator (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (10/10) Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (10/10)</fullReview>

I thought I would never see such great scene-stealing in a fantasy, let alone on film. The battles are an example for what an action film should be: emphasizing the plot, and giving reason for the destruction. If you want the ultimate experience, buy the extended edition DVD and see the gobs and gobs of things that wasn't there when you saw the movie or rented the previous DVD. I'm really sad that Gollum couldn't win (let alone be nominated) for an Oscar or a Golden Globe, which would usually be a bit lenient. Even though I haven't seen "Return of the King" yet, if it doesn't get its last praise, also known as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and/or an acting prize (because they'll definitely win a Special Effects prize at the least) then I'll be angered, if not cuckoo!</fullReview>

Even though I haven't seen "Return of the King" yet, if it doesn't get its last praise, also known as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and/or an acting prize (because they'll definitely win a Special Effects prize at the least) then I'll be angered, if not cuckoo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to be a fan to be awe-struck by it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 10 (out of 10)Better (and darker) in every aspect, `The Two Towers' is Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's `The Lord of the Rings' barreling forward like a freight train. The quality of diminished returns or `sequelitis' seem irrelevant to this series as it appears to have been so well constructed in Jackson's head that all 3 parts are operating as a whole. `Two Towers' takes everything that was set-up in `Fellowship of the Ring' and pays it off gloriously. This second film is a rich melting pot of many themes and elements that emerge in it's duration and Jackson weaves together masterfully (and amazingly considering the lofty task). He juggles crowd-pleasing summer movie action (few moments better than Orlando Bloom's elf Legolas riding a shield down a flight of stairs while shooting his usual perfectly aimed arrows) with more tranquil moments of cinematic beauty. This time around, the actions is more exciting and even the cornball one-liners are mixed into the proceedings at just the right time and temperature. While `Fellowship of the Ring' clunked from one phony special effects sequence to the next, Jackson has more control over the flow and pace now. As the characters all branch off into their respective directions, the movie cycles between them like an Inner-Earth soap opera without a dull moment. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen still own the show, but with the increased intensity of the situations the performances have stepped up as well. The dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and the 2 blonde Hobbets - Theoden &amp; Pippen - are now less annoying and effectively used for comic relief. Particularly, Viggo Mortensen steps up to take his Aragorn from scruffy lone ranger to reluctant epic hero. Also moving more prominently into the story is Gollum ? a former hobbit tortured and driven quite mad by the ring. Gollum is the Jar Jar Binks or Dobby of the series ? an annoying, self-destructive computer animated creature that gets a lot of screen time to display his rants. However, like everyone else, Gollum fits in and serves a purpose to the ensemble. Best supporting actor my ass, but that is a ridiculous idea to begin.`Two Towers' still has one of the biggest narrative flukes of `Fellowship' in it's ongoing quirk of killing off characters and then retracing the story to bring them back to life or show that they didn't really die. I'm sorry, but this is just bad writing. I can't blame Jackson for it because it feels like he is following directly from the book, trying to make the literature work while literally displayed on the screen. Jackson makes up for our ability to see the action by cutting away from it and then going back ? giving this movie the same effect one would have reading a book. I suspect this is weak narrative structure on Tolkien's part and Jackson is just trying to make sense of it all. As a bonus, he makes it relatable to the non-fanatics. For that I'm grateful for every little help he gives us.As `Two Towers' approaches its climax ? an epic `Capture the castle' battle between man and an army of beasts breed for the soul purpose of killing men ? it hits a high wondrous high. All these elements converge together and begin to sing. The visual effects have stepped up a notch and Howard Shore's score proves even more invaluable to the emotional overtones. Amid the action, Jackson knows that what really makes the movie work is the characters and specifically keeps the focus centralized on the relationship between the remaining fellowship members Aragon, Legolas &amp; the dwarf. Hearing them trade quips, sling arrows, joke around and stand together to fight is more rewarding than any of the action scenes. Not to short change the battle scenes, which are spectacular thanks to Jackson's immaculate attention to detail. In the end, its themes are timeless and to an extent still relative today. `Two Towers' is an awesome tale of real men that stand up and fight (and go to war) against overwhelming odds for the greater good. I would love to see a `Lord of the Rings' movie about a bunch of Democrats that sit around and try to negotiate with the ogres (hey, Roger Ebert, how is that for shamelessly inserting politics into a movie review). `Two Towers' achieves the most desirable qualities of a sequel: it elevates the original and leaves one both with the desire to see it again and rush to `Return of the King' to see how it ends. It is clear from frame one that this is the work of someone who loves the material and what he is doing and not just going through the motions - and how often do we see that from Hollywood? Simply awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 2 of the best trilogy of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I wasn't as hooked on Two Towers as I was hooked on Fellowship. For the first viewing, that is. One thing about this trilogy, all the movies certainly requires watching at least 2 times to get all the detail. The amount of detail in each movie is simply ASTONISHING. After a second viewing, the movie grew on me, and I came to realise it for what it was. Yet another masterpiece. Casting is of course, superb. Music is superb. Everything is simply superb. Makes me want to live in New Zealand.SPOILERS AHEAD.This movie is suitable for persons able to sit through an HOUR LONG battle. The battle for HELMS DEEP is one of the most intense, action packed scenes ever filmed. Therefore, sensitive young children should not see this movie. If you have young kids, leave them at home and let them watch it in a few years time. This trilogy will be the benchmark in movie making for DECADES, so it will still be here when your kids grow up. While not strictly following every nuance of Tolkien's book, even hardcore Tolkien fans will enjoy the trilogy immensly. Expecting complete accuracy from book to film is not feasable as books and movies are very different forms of entertainment. A 3 hour ride in movie heaven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can be said - slightly short of a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(minor interstitial spoilers) At least three-quarters of this movie is perfect - every scene, every character, every shot evenly and perfectly bears the weight of the entire movie. Though I felt some shots and characters were, perhaps, slightly wasted, in context it seems trivial. The ending 40-45 minutes could have been smoother--thus the one-quarter I am less confident about--and it certainly was dragging at the end. I overheard several people leaving the theater wondering aloud when the movie was going to end. Perhaps it was the late hour--our showing didn't let out until after midnight. Peter Jackson executes with a sure and confident hand in ROTK. His direction and editing is masterful and he brings his actors--who, frankly, were lacking in the previous films--up to the task in this final movie. I think the length of this production and the years the cast and crew spent making these films comes together to near-flawless effect in ROTK. The previous films were substantially flat in comparison. They were "good" and sometimes "bad" and almost never "great." I really think the actors - most of whom were not especially "great" actors before the Ring series - with the exception of Ian McKellan and Cate Blanchett, though she was essentially a beautiful mute in all previous - and Jackson himself, a B-grade horror movie director hitherto, didn't have great dramatic footing in the first two. Even though the story was clear, he didn't really know how to tell it in the first two films. Whatever his vision was, it fell short. The same cannot be said of ROTK. The battle for Minas Tirith I think will be remembered as one of the great battle scenes shot on film. The near-seamless combination of live action and CGI has set a new standard. It is breathtaking work and a real revelation of filmmaking craftsmanship.The only big dramatic "flaw" was the final anticlimactic battle at Mordor--even as you saw overwhelming numbers of baddies surrounding the armies of Gondor, you already knew that Mordor would be defeated. I have never read the books but even I was aware that Frodo and Sam would succeed in tossing the ring into the volcano. I didn't get a specific sense that the final 45 minutes or so were a tacked-on tying up of loose ends. It felt more like the dramatic energy was running thin, like everyone on the set was essentially running out of steam (and who can blame them?). Maybe it was deliberately played down because, after all, this isn't a "Hollywood Ending" kind of movie that can have a flaming building smoking in the background and a spiffy little remark as the credits close like a "Die Hard" or "Rambo"-type franchise. In the final analysis--if there is such a thing--it is nearly impossible to dismiss the whole because of any part of it. So much of it is composed and delivered so masterfully that the minor flaws are ultimately very easily excused. I found myself very satisfied that a movie, especially such an epic one, had been done so well--so often I find parts of movies great in certain aspects but other aspects act to effectively kick the leg of a table out and destroy the whole composition. ROTK has all its legs fully intact and strong at the end and we're very pleased to have watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "extended edition" should have been the primary release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Tolkien's "The Hobbit", after Bilbo uses the ring to ditch Gollum and get out of the goblin caves, he tells Gandalf, Thorin, and the other dwarves that he escaped without mentioning the ring. Later, while helping them out of another bind, he reveals to the dwarves that he can use the ring to become invisible at will, and the dwarves force him to retell the escape story with the ring included. Like Thorin and company, I feel that Peter Jackson's first telling of the Two Towers left out far too much core material; in the extended, the character modifications make sense, and the events flow together better.I wrote an earlier review expressing some mixed feelings about a few of the characters and plot elements after seeing the original, and took the opportunity to view the extended edition on screen Monday. It is superior in every way to the first release, moreso than the extended FotR was to the original. However, this is a disturbing trend. I would rather have seen *only* the extended edition rather than fart around with the inferior shortened product, but I suspect New Line is raking in the DVD profits with all these second releases. What can I say? Many of the gripes I had with the film are fixed in the extended release. It was enjoyable, heart wrenching, humourous, terrifying, and awe-inspiring. Yet somehow, I feel cheated. No doubt the same thing will happen in RotK, and we'll all gladly pony up the cash for an extra DVD purchase and maybe extra movie tickets too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the world of tolkien, finally captured on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Two Towers on dvd and i have to day it's a huge improvement on the first part. I remember reading Tolkien many many years ago and the main thing I liked about the novels was the calm and easy manner in which he created a world where men co-existed with elves, dwarves, orcs, hobbits, and what not. This magical sweep which permeates every page of Tolkien's writing was somehow absent in the first part, for me at least. Don't know why (have seen both films only once) but maybe it was that Peter Jackson had to spend a lot of time establishing characters and premise in part one. But Two Towers suffers no such problem. It captures the magical world of middle earth beautifully, a world not unlike our own, but yet so unlike ours, in that it is far more ancient, magical and most of all, full of natural wonders. It is a world where the earth has not yet been divorced from its ancient past. ***SPOILER BEGINS*** Trees talk, huge masses go to war, men form allegiances with elves, fortresses crumble, romance blossoms and even dies, elves wander off to strange places, forests whisper, kings fall into the grasp of evil and wither away, men get saved by strange powers, ***SPOILER ENDS*** strange creatures transformed by their own consciences inhabit the periphery of evil (Gollum is completely kick ass) and more and more. I'm not from the West so at some level all this mythology (which was at the core of Tolkien's writing) is not mine. But I'm a huge fan of its charm and wisdoms. And that exactly is what has started to permeate the Lord of the Rings movies. Am eagerly awaiting Part Three now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will tell that the two towers is so good. It's better than part one. The film has got a better plot, better character development, incredible battles, and beautiful special effects. But the real hero of the movie goes to Gollum. Gollum is the best performance. More charcater decvelopment is put into charcaters like Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf. But, as far as humans go-the movie belongs to the precious Eowyn, who I think is gorgeous for a Shieldmaiden of Rohan and Eomer, who has loves for horses. He's says he's the ruler of the riddermark, which is King theoden's men.Peter Jackson once again shows great talent, and icon actor Christopher Lee is extremely powerful as Saurman.The movie paces itself on suspense with wondrous creatures, amazing landscapes, action sequences, and then we get a one of the most astounding battle scenes ever filmed.The movie does not end the way Tolkien ended the two towers book, which is really the only fault of the film. They also could've axe out Arwen a little bit but she was good for awhile.the scene that were really startled me, was the bormoir and faramir sequence. How in the heck that was done. This film should reclaim classic cinema just because that scene. It carried a lot of emotional weight and it was very daring and risky for the filmmakers.Peter Jackson shows the enthusiasm that J.r.r tolkien had for trees. we also meet Treebeard, and the ents in this movie, which is pretty cool.To sum it up, this is my most favorite out of the series until 2 days from now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie on video. Even on out-of-date VHS, this film was still breathtaking. I've never read the books but I saw the first one. I don't mind long movies (Lawrence of Arabia is probably my favorite movie of all time!) and enjoyed this one. The first part was good and the battle at the end was well done. New Zealand is a great place to make movies.The movie was very epic. The acting was good as was the story. There weren't really any moments you had to cringe at, as in, parts that were unintentionally funny or bad looking. Fellowship had the battle between Gandalf and Sauruman that looked kind of cheesy with him spinning around on the floor. But any problems the first one had are not present in the second.There were only a few things I didn't really like. First, I thought the slow motion was kind of overdone. Second, Sean Connery shouldn't have turned down the role of Gandalf. Whoever played him (I'm not sure) did a good job, but Sean Connery is still Sean Connery. That one wasn't really a problem with the movie, but was a way to make the movie better.The battle at the end was very good. The orcs were well done and the computer animation blended overall with the live action and real backgrounds.All in all, I liked this movie and want to see the next one in theatresP.S., The beginning of the 21st century has seen three great trilogies emerge on screen. 1st, as fantasy, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings; Second, as science-fiction, the Wachowski brothers' Matrix Trilogy; Last, but not least, as both, George Lucas' Star Wars prequels. Any cursory glance at any internet board has shown that fans of these trilogies have heated "debates" that usually involve insulting of the person who is not selling their soul to watch whatever movie they happen to think is the best of all time.Why can't we just watch the movies, like them for the masterpieces that they are, and just get on with our lives?</fullReview>

The actors and crew went through so much effort for this movie and it has definently paid off. I would be able to watch this movie over and over again even though it goes for about 3 hours. The story line and the way they've filmed it is so entertaining, and always interesting. During this movie for the many times i have viewed it my eyes are glued to the screen, and even though i know the plot i like to watch to see just what might happen in the next movie. This is great making three movies because after seeing the second movie the third one coming out is the highlight of my year! If you haven't yet seen this get your ass out there and see it. I would definently recommend to see the third as it has been said that it is better than both combined by actors in the movie.

		<fullReview>The list of sequels equal to or better than their predecessors has always been a short one, and every true movie buff can recite that list without even blinking. GODFATHER 2. ALIENS. TERMINATOR 2. STAR TREK 2. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, (although this last one has always been controversial.)Now TTT can be added to that list, and I daresay that RETURN OF THE KING will probably follow it. Peter Jackson and his crew have not simply brought the once-considered unfilmable bulk of J.R.R. Tolkien's world from the printed page to the big screen. They have made their mark upon it for all time, as well as changing the face of moviemaking as we know it. Just looking at Gollum, I feel no need to justify this statement. It is simply a fact.Ever since seeing FELLOWSHIP in the theater, then seeing the Extended Version on DVD, we swore we'd never again trust a theatrical version in this series, but simply wait for the DVD/EV release. I'm so glad we did.Not having read the books all the way through, I can't say what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens kept or what they left out. But what was included, is the magnificent tale of good and evil, love and hatred, greed and sacrifice, the blackest despair and the utmost hope. And not to mention the truest meaning of humanity, displayed in the loyalty and undying friendship between the splintered Fellowship members, especially Frodo and Sam.If nothing else at all about this film impresses you, simply sit back and marvel at the wonder of Andrew Lesnie's panoramic vistas. Lean, Kubrick, Ford, Kurosawa....they would all applaud what he, Peter Jackson and company have done to take the most breathtaking aspects of New Zealand, and transform them into Middle Earth.And as consistently marvelous as all of the actors are, both old and new to the series, Andy Serkis must be singled out, for giving his all to a character that would never allow his face to be seen on camera. But without his performance, Gollum could never be as staggeringly real as he is, and without Gollum, the entire enterprise would be practically worthless. CGI character or not, once again the Academy stumbled and fell by failing to recognize one of the most spellbinding achievements in cinematic history.TTT/EV runs at nearly four hours, and it's worth every minute. Any film or film series that causes people to run back to the bookstores and start reading again, is aces in my book, and I will be as sorry as anyone to see it all come to an end. But that said, RETURN OF THE KING cannot possibly get released fast enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly inferior to Fellowship but still a fantastic fantasy epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship Of The Ring was an incredible film and an incredible achievement. Peter Jackson and his team got so much right that the tiny flaws seem hardly worthy of mention,and some of these were even ironed out in the Extended Version of the film.The Two Towers manages to be almost,but not quite,as brilliant. Once again we are immersed in a superbly detailed and convincing fantasy world that has great effects and awesome action but also strong characterisation. There are very few scenes that don't use special effects in some way,the film is packed with "wow"-type spectacle,but we are never allowed to forget about the people at the heart of the story.Another terrific film,than,but sadly several flaws make it just a bit inferior to Fellowship. The film does not flow quite as well,with Jackson never completely solving the problem of cutting back and forth from different stories. Some parts seem overly rushed while other bits are dragged out,for example Merry and Pippin's encounters with the Ents only take up about 7 or 8 mins while the lead up to the Battle of Helm's Deep takes forever.Sadly,Jackson also felt a need to tamper with the source material far more than in Fellowship. This is partly because he leaves out the last few chapters of the book,and therefore has to invent a great deal,may be not a big problem for those who have not read the book,but the story seems very stretched out and some of the added occurrences,such as Aragorn's separation from his companions,and his flashbacks of Arwen,seem like padding and make the middle hour drag a bit too much. Because Frodo and Sam's encounter with Shelob is missing,there was felt a need to invent another climactic story element with Frodo and Sam,but the whole Faramir/Osgilliath subplot feels hurried,as if it was made up on the spot,which it possibly was.However,the elves arrival at Helm's Deep works superbly.Still,there is so much that is great about The Two Towers. It has a commendable different feel to it then Fellowship,somewhat more realistic and a lot more humorous,this does not entirely work but kudos for trying not to give us too much of the same. A few action sequences seem rushed but the middle Warg battle is thrilling and convincing-you mostly believe that the orcs are riding those creatures,and of course the lengthy Battle Of Helm's Deep is stunning,a truly great battle to rank with the best of Kurosawa and Eisenstein. The highlight,though ,is the climatic assault on Isengard by the Ents,an amazing spectacle.The cast is again superb and two potentially problematic characters,Treebeard {and the other walking trees} and the sinister but oddly moving Gollum,are brilliantly achieved. In Gollum we have the most convincing CGI character so far done on film. Howard Shore's score is even better than his work on Fellowship,providing some of the most rousing film music in years but subtle in unusual places {such as Helm's Deep}. There are problems with this film,but all in all,it's still far better than pretty much everything else that came out this year.A NOTE ABOUT THE EXTENDED VERSION As with Fellowship,the extended version is superior. While there are less important scenes added than in Fellowship,the film flows a lot better and is much more evenly paced. Still not as good as Fellowship,but very close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Useless Comment ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I call this the most useless comment because, most likely, everyone reading this has seen the film ... so there is really no point in commenting... however, the reason I am is because movies that excel beyond the point of masterpiece deserve to have comments ...  If that last line didn't make it obvious enough, this movie climbs the tower of masterpieces and finds itself a nice little spot at the top. There is no way around it; if you didn't like this movie, then you were sitting in the wrong theater and you must have seen Cabin Fever by accident ... I usually end with the rating, but I think I'll start with this one; without a doubt, 10/10, five stars out of five, however you want to scale it, it gets the highest marks. However, I will justify these marks, because I rarely give five stars, so here's the reasons ... The Good News: The whole movie ... every single part of it ... it's an epic adventure with the strongest plot push I have ever seen in a trilogy, dare I say even stronger than Empire Strikes Back ... without question, this movie makes you glad you saw the first and beyond the bounds of anticipation in desire to see the third (December 17th, get here fast!) The acting is superior, to the point where you truly feel for the characters. The script is insurmountable, catching what must be the very heart of Middle Earth and translating into picture, sight and sound. The music is awe-inspiring, and a great cheer must go out to Howard Shore and the voice talents that he found to carry this movie from stronger to strongest. And, above all, we cannot forget the power of the novel that inspired this movie and it's successor and predecessor; the unrivaled writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic universe of Middle-Earth.  There can be no argument to say that this movie does not deserve to be where it stands. Number 4 film (at time of writing) on the IMDB's top 250 films; it's predecessor, number eight, and should it's successor reach the same heights, it will be the highest trilogy on the list, not to mention this film being the number four film. If memory serves, the IMDB hosts 150,000 films; I dare someone to stand up and try to knock the number four film out of 150,000 ... what leg can you possibly stand on? This movie will entertain for years to come; it will undoubtedly become one of those films that everyone has seen, and will be able to talk about for hours. And I will see you all December 17th, when the Return of the King concludes this most powerful trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much more confident sequel to The Fellowship, with Matrix-rivalling CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is an adult in comparison to the awkward teenager of The Fellowship. My two main gripes with the first film of the trilogy are more or less resolved in the second: CGI and bluescreen integration are much more convincing and any over-inflated acting has been tightened up. All the characters now seem more settled.Principally amongst these is the Aragorn of Viggo Mortensen; like all these epic stories, there is no one chief protagonist, but Mortensen would be right to consider Aragorn as good a lead role as any. Where that leads to some amorphous characterization in The Fellowship, here he's relly got a hold on the whole hero thing (although I think that might have spilt over into the contemporaneous A Perfect Murder, where he plays a duplicitous murderer as if he were King Oedipus). Bernard Hill's King Theoden is a weighty but muscular leader of the goodies against the baddies - there are lots and lots of baddies - in the astonishing final battle sequence. And particularly impressive is Jackson's restrained, unsyrupy handling of the sprouting romance between Aragorn and the king's daughter.There's plenty more lush New Zealand and the first full encounters with an entirely CGI Gollum, which is little short of a miracle - not only entirely convincing as another character, but also in Gollum's shocking schizophrenia. The (4 disc!) special-ed DVD is impressive, but you miss nothing of Jackson's impressively realised intentions if you just get the one out of the video store. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film two in Peter Jackson's immense trilogy based on the Tolkien novel, which follows the various factions of the Fellowship following their split at the end of film one. Frodo and Sam rely on Gollum (a superb CGI character based on the real movements and vocalisations of actor Andy Serkis) to take them on the last and most dangerous stage of their journey ? to take the ring into Mordor. The ring continues to expand its influence and drain Frodo of strength, changing his personality. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas save the kingdom of Rohan from enchantment and destruction, culminating in the battle at Helm's Deep (itself a triumph of the work of the Weta Digital workshop, with a believable set of digitally created soldiers and miniatures). And Pippin and Merry find themselves in trouble, first in an Orc attack and then with the weird treebound Ents in the forest of Fangorn. Gandalf also makes a spectacular reappearance as we discover just what did happen after the Balrog snatched him from the cliff in Film one.?Two Towers' is faster paced than ?Fellowship', as makes sense as the action moves closer and closer to the evil domains and away from the comfort of the Shire. This transition has its effect on hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, and wizards alike. Of the actors, Elijah Wood continues to impress as Frodo, drawn ever onward by an impossible quest. Sean Astin gives the character of Frodo's faithful friend Sam a quiet dignity, while Dominic Monahan and Billy Boyd provide much-needed comic relief in appropriate places. Also impressive are Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen, who let Gandalf and Aragorn develop into key characters in the drama.For a film that has no real beginning and no ending (but an interesting cliffhanger in the Frodo strand of the story) it holds the attention surprisingly well and sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After director Peter Jackson's exciting and emotionally affecting first chapter in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you would think he could do no wrong. While The Two Towers continues to up the stakes in terms of action and pure escapism it does not quite live up the sheer perfection of Fellowship of the Ring.TTT starts exactly where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam continue on their quest to Mordor while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail of the orcs who took Merry and Pippin. The story follows three distinct threads (that of Frodo and Sam, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and Merry and Pippin), unlike FotR, which was quite linear in its storytelling.The introduction of new characters such as Gollum (a work of technical genius), Eowyn (played with perfect restraint by Miranda Otto), Faramir (David Wenham) and Grima Wormtongue helps to keep the story interesting.Though much complaint has been aimed at Faramir's out of character behaviour, in regards to the source material, and other deterrence's from the book. I wholeheartedly understand why the writers took these minor liberties with the direction that was taken with his character, as it no doubt works better for the film.The majority of TTT basically foreshadows what is to come in Return of the King and also sets up the most exciting aspect of this movie, the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is technically impressive, with ingenious cinematography from Andrew Lesnie, brilliant choreography of fight scenes and a perfect score from Howard Shore to compliment the action and heighten the tension.I do have my complaints though. The fact this is the bridging chapter is noticeable and while some of the film's weaknesses can be attributed to this, no good reason can be given for the extremely slow pacing of the first 90 minutes. This is primarily due to some extremely annoying editing and writing choices that detract from the overall movie. Arwen's scenes and the unneeded, and somewhat underwhelming, Warg Rider battle simply don't add anything worthwhile to the story. Several scenes that can now be seen on TTT Extended Edition would have been better suited to the theatrical cut.Had the omission of Arwen's plot been considered, allowing for the insertion of some truly satisfying material (such as Aragorn's revelation to Eowyn that he is 87 years old and the Entwash scene), The Two Towers, in my eyes, would have been the perfect bridging chapter between FotR and RotK. As it stands a good 30 minutes could have been edited out of the theatrical version and this movie would surely be more deserving of the praise it receives.The Two Towers is a slightly disappointing middle chapter to what is becoming one of the greatest movie series ever made. Quality is one thing this series will be associated with and TTT continues this trend with its meticulous attention to detail, brilliant special effects and impressive acting.8 out of 10 EE - 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended Edition is Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*When Fellowship of the Ring came out in theatres, I became gradually aware that it was the best movie I had ever seen. I went on to watch it 16 times in the theatre. When the extended edition was released, I was somewhat disappointed. The extra scenes were nice, but they broke the heart-pounding pace of the movie. It felt very long compared to the theatrical version.Then Two Towers was released in theatres. Again, there was something not quite right. I felt compelled to see it only five times in the theatre. I desperately wanted to love it, but parts of it were unsatisfying, particularily the character of Faramir, the Ent subplot, and a few nagging plot holes. There was something missing.Then came the Extended Edition. Praise God. I felt the magic of watching the Fellowship for the first time seeping into my soul again. All the meat of the Two Towers I wanted to love was there. Faramir's character is developed, making his releasing Frodo meaningful. We get to spend more charming and delightful time with Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard. More time with Gollum, increasing the tragedy of his character which we know is coming. The plot holes are filled in.The theatrical version of Fellowship was wonderfully edited and essentially perfect. But for the Two Towers, the theatrical editing process was a gutting. I can never watch the theatrical version again. It is a pathetic shell of a movie.My eyes have been opened. The Two Towers is truly a worthy successor of the Fellowship of the Ring. Thank you, Peter Jackson and team, for making these wonderful movies. I know now that Return of the King will me a triumph. May these films shine eternally as the greatest art our civilization can create.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very impressed with EV, only one big flaw though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extended version: 11/24/03 **** of 4 I'm very impressed with the new scenes in the EV. I also like to say that I think there change Faramir was good idea. They wanted to make Faramir important character and to have him have a journey. Gollum facial features were collebarated and fantastic. While Boromir and fAramir and denethour sequence was amazing. This movie also runs pretty quickly.Oh yes, the funeral scene was absolutely amazing. It scared me one they pushed Theodred into the gravestone. Boromir holding up the flag was very epic.I enjoyed that they honored Tom Bombadil giving Tom's line to Treebeard at the entwash scene.I like how we learn how Aragorn is 87 years old. Also the Saurman's scene reminded of great good vs evil confrontations.The opening sequence with the rocks was a beautiful scenery than Frodo and Sam walking up the mountain. It reminded me of one movie called "The Vertical Limit".I enjoyed the comical scenes in the film including where Gimli says "this new gandalf more grumpier than the old gandalf."I also liked Gandalf's speech about the coming of the ents.The editing was more smoother. The music was haunting, and beautiful. The lighting seemed more brighter and we got to see more of New Zealand.One big mistake was I think the Gollum/Smeagol scene was unnecessary. It just didn't seem to fit with the story. Other than, great movie.However, I think that the extended cut should've been the theatrical cuts. The extended cut is much more different than the theatrical cut. It patches up the little things to make a story, to not put as much pressure for the filmmakers, as well as telling the viewer what's happening.Anyways I'm not saying anything else about the negatives of the film. I still think that scene with Aragorn falling off the cliff was unnecessary.I'm glad to see I know more about the Aragorn and Arwen and last Alliance of the Elves from Peter Jackson. I'll give him benefit of the doubt on he got this from the appendices of the book.I asked myself this question, would J.R.R. Tolkien would've been happy with this edition. Probably not, but he would've accepted and I do too and I like iy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent, top 10 movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the movie in cinema, I gave it a score of 9. Yesterday I got the extended edition, 4 DVD box set, as a gift, and enjoyed the 214 minutes of film. I agree with many others that this was the version I want to have seen in cinema. I don't mind sitting 214 minutes in my chair.It is a shame that so many parts were cut out in the original release, like Merry and Pippin being swallowed by Old Man Willow, the moving of the forest to help Rohan, the eating of the Orcs by this forest, the funeral of Theodred, the part where Eowyn founds out the real age of Aragorn, and much much more. This version of the movie makes more sense, more things are explained, the story is more comprehensible and logical. And above all that, the scenes that were cut out are often magnificent, in themselves better than many complete movies I've seen.The characters, the special effects, the sets, the paintings, the armory, the humor, the biting similarities with the real sad history of the world, the overwhelming music and the beautiful views of New Zealand nature: this movie contains a lot of wonderful movies, more action than most action movies, more emotions than most dramas, more story developments than most fiction movies.I re-voted and now gave a 10 for Two Towers. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am certainly going to see this many times.I really look forward to Return of the King. I've read somewhere that it will be over 3 hours in cinema and over 6 hours on the extended edition. Next month I will join the marathon session in my local cinema, watching all three movies in a row. This is the best thing ever happened to cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, with a few forgivable flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers was an astonishing movie. I sat through most of it with my mouth open and my eyes gaping, unblinking at the screen. To be honest I haven't read the books so I was seeing the story for the first time with Fellowship and Towers. I was not disappointed.My only complaints would be as follows:Gimli, a very cool character in Fellowship, was turned into a bumbling oaf in the Towers, the butt of jokes that I felt robbed him of his dignity in the story.Arwen, who apparently was not even in the books, was tacked on to give Liv Tyler a role in the movie, perhaps to add a little more star power. It was not necessary, and I felt her scenes in Towers dragged the movie down a bit.There was a certain feel to fellowship that was lacking in Towers. There was a sense of gradiose adventure in Fellowship, with the Kracken, and the trip through the mines of Moria, the various battles here and there. In Towers the closest we came to such adventure was the attack of the wargs, which seemed to be over as soon as it begun (once again with Gimli bungling about, contributing only cheap laughs to the scene).There were also many very touching scenes in Fellowship that made me walk out of the theater deeply moved long after the movie was over. The death of Gandalf, the death of Boromir, Merry and Pippin taking a brave stand in his defense -against impossible odds, and finally Samwise marching into the water and almost drowning, refusing to let his friend go on without him. There were all very powerful scenes in Fellowship. Towers was lacking in any of this heart. The closest it came was the scenes where the people were preparing their hearts for the battle of helm's deep. There was Aragorn leading the elves into battle after the wall explodes. There was Gandalf leading the horsemen down the mountainside in the end of the battle. This was an amazing scene, but a little too short to be considered perfection. There was also Sam's speech about heroes at the end. These were all awesome, but not as powerful as anything in Fellowship.Apparently the Special edition DVDs remedy a lot of these concerns of mine. I can't wait to see it.These few flaws are all forgivable of course. They by no means ruined the movie for me. The action of Helm's deep was breath-taking and the struggle of Frodo with the ring was gut-wrenching, particularly when he attacks Sam, and I won't even get started on how cool Golem/Smeagul was. All-in-all, I'd say Two Towers is on the list of my top 5 favorites of all time.I give the Two Towers a 9, whereas Fellowship Gets a 10. I'll no doubt change this to a 10 after I've seen the Special Edition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a string of great movies, Spirited Away, Punch Drunk Love, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It has been a great movie every week. I am happy to say that I found another great movie. The special effects were beyond amazing. The best characters and effects were the trees. The attack on the evil wizard made people cheer in the theater and made the hairs on my neck stand up. Also the computer generated character Gollum/Smeagol is how a computer-generated character should look. Director used the perfect mix of organic scenery and computer generation. Unlike Star Wars that had fake looking scenery, LOTR 2 has beautiful mountainous scenery of New Zealand, where the film was shot. And the digital animation was not cheesy.Some complaints: The flashback love scenes between Aragon and Arwen were unnecessary, I guess it was trying to show that her love got him through tough situation, but I thought it was annoying. Also, the movie just seemed like one big battle, but when I read the book it did not feel like that. I know a major part of the book was the impending war, but there were just too many fight scenes. Were these fight scenes added because of complaints that there was not enough action in part I? I don't know, but it just seemed like the movie was a constant action scene, and the book did not have that feel. 8/10</fullReview>

There were non sequiturs, misplaced emphasis, deviations from Tolkein which made no sense.Having seen the film as it ought to have been, I am now of the view that this is the amongst the best few films ever made. The changes are improvements and make the structure more logical- the story has been improved, something just about unique in cinema history; the cinematography is a higher standard than has ever been seen in any film.This is a film Orson Welles would have made if he hadn't been a bad actor and a worse director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EE is a big improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers)The Extended Edition of The Two Towers is a vast improvement over the theatrical version. Watching this movie in the theater I was confused a lot of the time. I wasn't sure what was really going on. Having not read the books, I couldn't fill in the gaps that it left in the story. That has pretty much been cleared up for me now. I understand the motivations of the character of Faramir, and his brother Boromir, much better now that they were given a decent backstory in one scene which was only a few minutes. (Why these scenes can't be left in the theatrical release of an already long movie is beyond me.) Merry and Pippin have some fabulous scenes as well that add so much charm to what had been an action movie. Now it's a whole movie. Almost every character benefitted from little extra tidbits that really make a difference. Things that seemed to be overdone like the refugees, Arwen, the wargs, all the stuff that seemed to drag on just kinda goes by unnoticed now because there is so much more in the movie that frames them so it's not really a problem anymore.I didn't "like" the theatrical version of this movie. I could appreciate the work that went into it, the scope of it, the acting, costume design, all the technical stuff. But it was missing something. Now it's not. 10/10. You should really see this version. If you can't or don't want to buy it, borrow a friend's.Let's just hope that in the future, the studios will realize that movie fans want to see good complete movies even if it takes more than 3 1/2 hours to watch them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the extended version of this movie, I'm going to have to change my vote for this movie from a 9 to a 10 (pretty much what happened with the first one). They fixed everything I found wrong with the first. The theatrical was a great thrill ride. It was fast paced, and you could really feel the doom upon all the good guys. But the extended was an epic of biblical proportions on its own. Jackson expands the depth of every character in the movie, often going beyond what even Tolkien depicted. The most important thing is that Faramir's character is completely redeemed. Although still not quite the same character he was portrayed in the book, he is depicted as a much more similar character to the one in the book in the extended cut than he is depicted in the theatrical cut. He is a much more sympathetic character, and it is now understandable why it took him so long to make the right decision. We now know more about the ents, (and the entwives), and we get more Gandalf, which I can't get enough of. We also get more of an end to this movie. I always thought the theatrical version ended prematurely. After all it left nearly half the book untold. This one still doesn't make it to the end of the book, but it doesn't leave much left, and it ends on a much more satisfying note, although still a brilliant cliffhanger. If you have the option and the extra 40 minutes, definitely see the Extended edition instead of the theatrical version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation, but one flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. They have accomplished what I originally thought impossible. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material. It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.: Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo &amp; Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me! In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees an `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and uses it deliberately to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring. In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King.</fullReview>

And we are told that this is just a taster of what is to come, as the third part of the trilogy, The Return of the King, is supposed to be even better than both of its predecessors. It has an all star cast lead by Ian McKellan and Elijah Wood and co starring the likes of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett and Bernard Hill. But to single out any of the actors is to do an injustice to the rest of the cast. All the performances were stunning doing justice to what is a long enduring story. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote this story over one hundred years ago and it is still read and told to children today. My wife and I are now counting the days (well not quite but it feels like it) till The Return of the King is released. The story grips your mind from start to finish.

		<fullReview>The second installment of LOTR is either harder or easier to take than the first, depending on your POV. The massive battle scenes help, but they don't save it. Way too much talk, way too many characters, way too much scene shifting, and now that I have finally watched it all the way through, way too much of that annoying cartoon Gollum. It might amuse 8-year-olds, but it definitely is not going to play well to adults, especially females. But then, it wasn't made for them. It is essentially a giant, murky, bloated cartoon.

		<shortDescription>Wow (a bit of a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an absolutely great movie. I really, really love the Lord of the Rings movies. This one, I thought, was just as good as "The fellowship of the Ring", or perhaps even better. In the book at some points Tolkiens' writing is just to slow so that some paragrahp's are just to long. In the movie's there is just no time to go into every detail, which, in this case, is just for the good.I can see that this movie is made by people who just care about the story and it's characters. Although the movie is almost black and white, the way it looks is just astonishing. Peter Jackson did take a lot of care about the way things look. It's just as the way Tolkien describes it. Watching it, it made me belief that I didn't watch actors acting not being human in New Zealand, but that I really did see hobbits, elfs, orks, ents, dwarfs and people going on a quest in Middle-earth. The acting is perfect. I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen, Liv Taylor, Bernhard Hill, Ian Mckellen, Orlando Bloom and all the others become their characters. The battle of Helms deep was amazing, very dark and violent, but it took my breath away.The best part of the movie though wasn't the big battle in Helms Deep, but the journey of Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Their relationship is very complex and I'm very thankful that Peter Jackson spent a lot of screening time on their interaction. Elijah Wood and Sean Austin are really very good as Frodo and Sam, but the most noticeable actor in this case was definitely Andy Serkis as Gollum. When I read the book I already thought that Gollum was a very interesting character. The way he interacts with him self, his double feelings about Frodo (Gollum hates him, because Frodo has his precious, but Smeagol adores him), the way that the ring still has an enslaving effect on him... Although I know that in the end he wants to trick Frodo and Sam to get to the ring, I couldn't help but feeling sorry for him, just the way Frodo did. Gollum is really a pitiful and sad character, who has become a sort of monster, because of the influence of the ring, and NOT because he was born like that. I love the way Andy Serkis portrays all of this and makes him a very deep and believable.Over all. If you haven't watched this movie yet, go and see it. You won't be sorry. I can't wait to see The Return of the King.of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's different from the book, BUT it's still great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so tired of reading comments about how "awful" this film is because it "destroys Tolkien's vision." THIS ISN'T TOLKIEN'S VISION--IT'S PETER JACKSON'S! Yes, the Two Towers strays from the literature in several key places. Most notably, Sam and Frodo don't go to Mordor in the book, Aragorn doesn't fall off a cliff, and backstory of Arwen and Aragorn's romance isn't discussed, Shelob the spider is missing, and there are no elves fighting at Helm's Deep (speaking of which, the battle in the book is quite short--but it manages to take up the last thirty minutes of the movie.)OKAY, so it's different. But how can you say the film is "awful?" The movie is absolutley beautiful and breathtaking, and some scenes look like gothic, epic, biblical portraits. The scene in which Gandalf the White comes down the hill to battle the Orcs at Helm's Deep, for example is wonderful. His entire army backlit by his powerful white light, it's such an image of hope that it gave me chills.And Gollum is terrific in this movie. The scenes in which he argues with himself were done superbly. His character as a whole sets up suspense and humor. He is simply the most realistic CGI character ever created.I think it is fair to say that you can feel frustrated that Peter Jackson changed some of the material and some of the characters. But how can you hate such a powerful, beautiful film just because it's different??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings "The Two Towers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MILD SPOILERS*** This movie speaks of many little stories that all come together in the end. The movie is about a fantasy world with orcs, goblins, wizards, men, hobbits, dwarves, and elves. It is about a great battle for the world. The director and author of the film are not only trying to cross the point of good and evil, but also are trying to show the prejudice working together. The survival of the kingdom requires the good of the world to unite and set aside their differences. The time of the elves is over and they wish to abandon the world and go to the undying lands where they may stay for all eternity with the Valor (Gods). If the elves stay, they can help to crush the threat which may defeat the entire world they have lived on for thousands of years.The main source of destroying the threat of evil lies with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). Frodo has the ring of power. The ring is calling to its original master. This is a sequel to the Lord of the Rings `The Fellowship of the Ring.' The fellowship has broken. Frodo and Sam are alone and lost. They end up meeting with Gollum (voice: Andy Serkis) who used to hold the ring, and for nearly five hundred years it poisoned his mind. The ring's original master is the dark lord Sauron. If the dark lord gets the ring back, the entire world will be covered under his shadow and all life will be gone. The journey for Frodo, Sam, and Gollum is to go to Mount Doom and cast the ring into the fire; the one and only place the ring can be destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but tended to drag a bit more than the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Tolkien fan, and after the incredible first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy I was really looking forward to The Two Towers. There are many epic fight scenes - my favourite being the treants versus the forces of Saruman the White at his tower in Eisengard :) It is a must to watch. However I can only hope that in the final installment, The Return Of The King, there is less of a sense of it being dragged out in parts. This could primarily be achieved by leaving all scenes involving Samwise Gamgi out of the film. His "fondness" for Frodo is done a bit over the top and you are left with the feeling that Sam would gladly wipe Mr. Frodo's butt-crack if need be. This minor irritation and the fact that a few scenes dragged a bit are all that prevent me giving this film a rating of 9 or 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've Ever Seen ^O^</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I thought "The Fellowship of the Rings" was good, but "The Two Towers" totally blew away my expectations. I was glad I waited until the DVD was released, with the lack of today's movie theatres posting an intermission. I didn't want to miss a thing, and some scenes were so good I had to play them three times over before going on. I like the Dead Marsh scene, with creatures scarier than even "The Exorcist." Jackson's direction parallel's Ralph Bakshi's animated version of "The Lord of the Rings" in 1978, which is precisely why I like it. Even the parts with no action are fascinating, with breathtaking, sweeping panoramic mountain vistas and novelistic settings. I cannot imagine another adventure movie outdoing this series, or even daring to be better than "The Two Towers," except the final movie due out in I believe December. I may not be able to wait for the DVD. I thought I was too old to be infatuated with any movie any more, most of them lacking any originality, but not here. Way better than Star Trek ever dreamed. Best combination of live action and computer technology imaginable. Unprecedented, except by the first movie. Must have it, we wants it--the precious. Can't wait for the gift set with the cool bookends I saw for "The Fellowship..." Superlative job, to cast and crew of "The Lord of the Rings." "The supreme adventure of our time." By far an understatement.</fullReview>

Saruman became more evil. Frodo became obsessed with the ring. We saw more of Gollum. Someone mentioned Boromir. Eowyn showed up and shes so beatiful. I hope Aragorn and Eowyn get together. I dont understand why Arwen and Aragorn dreams to be together. Aragorn should go to Arwen then,its like they dont have a realitionship at all.i dont understand them!!!I hope i can see more of Sauron in the next movie, The Return Of The King!!!Its exiting. I cant wait also for the fight of Middle-Earth. Two Towers is impressing and deserves a 6!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOTR:TTT is a wonderfully crafted movie with amazing writing, great directing, fantastic special effects(especially Gollum) and Top notch acting all around. A great sequel and movie. No wonder this and LOTR:FOTR are Classics. This movie a lot more money than part one, in my mind this isn't better than FOTR but is still a Spectacular movie to see everytime. What I really liked about this movie, is more complex and way darker than the last chapter. I still don't know how Peter Jackson wasn't even nominated for this amazing movie and also this not winning a BEST PICTURE award, which deserve to win instead of that overrated movie Chicago. I regret seeing this only once in the theater but now I can see this anytime I want on DVD. T give PJ and his crew all the credit in the world for these two Classic films and possibly third. Can't wait for the last chapter in December. I hope Pj finally wins a Oscar for his great directing and also this Brilliant Trilogy winning a BEST PICTURE award. A True Masterpiece.(10/10 rate and A).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My second favorite film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case your wondering what my favorite film is, it would have to be the first lord of the rings. Im not going to go into detail why, but mainly because its kind of like an intro to the world of middle earth and all of its inhabitants we meet, and it lays down the premise,so it felt new and unlike something never seen before, it went into the territory of the unknown, and when ever you go into something completely fresh its a little more exciting, at least to me anyways.Well anyways two towers, an amazing and incredibly accomplished film. There are so many things you can say about how great this film is, but instead of explaining go watch it and figure them out for yourself.

		<fullReview>I've seen The Two Towers at least 9 times now and I still love it. Although it lacks all the heart and emotional content that Fellowship of the Ring had, it's a very solid adventure movie. The last hour is nothing short of epic and the beginning hour of it is really good too. The only minor gripe I have with it is that it starts to lag around the middle, which I expect will be spiced up when November rolls around. It's a great movie with great characters and I 'know' Return of the King will be just as great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first part of The Lord of The Rings trilogy was very overrated. The action scenes were repetitive and overlong and some of the characterizations were terribly annoying (Merry, Pippin, Sam). The second installment however, overcomes it's very choppy editing (especially regarding the romance between Aragorn and Arwen) and definitely rises above Fellowship of The Ring.One of the main reasons is the presence of The Ents (the walking, talking trees.) These scenes are excellent. They stand for the all the environmental destruction that has gone on the past century, whether by war or industrialization. Merry and Pippin were seriously toned down, whether by circumstances, or the realization of the filmmakers and actors that their antics in Fellowship was very detrimental to a consistent tone for the series. These scenes were very powerful. The score by Howard Shore is very good especially in the Ent scenes. Bernard Hill is excellent in the role of King Theoden. Miranda Otto as his niece Eowyn is very impressive, and I look forward to more of her in Return of The King. The widely hailed Helm's Deep climax was largely sabotaged by the dual between Legolas and Gimli as to who could kill more. Another good aspect of the movie is Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis. There are a couple of good scenes involving Frodo sympathizing with Gollum because of the effect the ring had on him. Overall The Two Towers was a tremendous improvement over The Fellowship of The Ring, but because of the editing problems and the incompetent acting of Sean Astin, still is wildly overrated with many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some of the battle of Helm's Deep is a little far-fetched, Jackson's second effort in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is full of the stuff that makes a movie great. Rhys-Davies is brilliant as ever as the grumbling, but ever-faithful Gimli. Aragorn is again superbly played. Though I am personally not an Orlando Bloom fan, he's OK in his outing as Legolas. I wag my hand at Wood and Astin, though Astin's ever-innocent portrayal of the loyal Sam is heart-warming and sweet. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are fair, Brad Dourif is typecast, and Hugo Weaving, unfortunately, seemed constantly on the verge of a "Mr. Anderson." Andy Serkin, however, was gypped out of an Oscar nod by a technicality. His excellent characterization of the lost soul of Smeagol/Gollum is dead-on and tears at the heart, at times. Sir Ian McKellen is equally powerful, as usual.Don't get me wrong here, the acting is only the beginning of the brilliance of this movie. The cinematography is excellent, the views lush and gorgeous, and the sets were something straight from Tolkien. Not to mention this film includes one of the greater 5-second scenes in all of cinema - Aragorn entering the palace, slow motion, enormous doors swinging wide. Beautiful. This film flows much more easily than the first. It rivets the audience more and utilizes a broader range of character, imagination, and design than Fellowship. One can only hope that Peter Jackson will stun us again with Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just bought the DVD of this movie - I will also buy the extended version, but I couldn't wait. I have just watched the first hald so far, but I have to say that seeing it again in the kind of detail a DVD allows just confirmed for me what an incredible, awe-inspiring achievement this trilogy is.There is not a scene that passes during which I do not marvel at the vision and the detail that went into the scripting, sets and props in this film. The world of the Riders of Rohan is particularly impressive with the horse-head details on Eomer's helmet and the hilt of Theoden's sword. The fantastic detail of Gimli's metalwork and the faded glory of Aragorn's clothes. The grass growing on the thatch of the halls of Rohan's capital. To see the hall of the Riddermark built in that fantastic location takes my breath away. Even the minor parts like the costumes of the Southron warriors who almost catch Frodo and Sam outside the devilish Black Gate of Mordor are beautifully designed and fit in with the incredible cultural world that Jackson's designers have created. Just look at the weave of the elvish cloaks. Will we ever see another film so beautifully concieved and so adeptly executed?I just wish the votes went up to 11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone who read the books over and over will most likely hate these movies. Because they do not 100% follow them nor your imagination. It is impossible for them to. This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book. In all honesty if you never read the books and enjoy epics like Braveheart you will love these films.I grew up playing Dungeon and Dragons for fun and have played many RPG PC games. No movie to date comes closer to what these experiences are then these Epic Movies. I mean people complain about LOTR? Have you people seen the crap Dungeons and Dragons movie?There is a point where you can over analyize something. The LOTR book readers have done just that. I'm not one to read books over and over but I can enjoy a movie again if I am watching it with someone new or it has been along time. You guys need to Relax. This movie is beautifully shot and casted well. Peter Jackson is not known for anything but these movies and he will be known forever for these. The backdrop of New Zealand is perfect for middlearth. LOTR is scored by music that engulfes you into the scenes. But what makes these movies so great is the story by Tolkien but adapted by Jackson. It works Period.I'm sure you guys are mad that page 56 of book 2 has a character pausing for breath when they forgot to show it in the movie! Oh the horror. Get over it move on you have your books read them enjoy them. I judged this movie based on it being a MOVIE. I don't even want to read the books after hearing the comments made by their fans. You guys need to ask yourself is this movie REALLY that bad? Or do movies like Excaliber and Conan do it better? I think not. Yes it is not perfect but damn is it good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More great characters come to life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This has some SPOILERs)They say this part was the most difficult to film, as it´s in the center of the trilogy. Well, it isn´t as good as the Fellowship of the Ring, but this part has still a lot of great stuff in it.First, there´s Gollum. You simply can´t write a review of this movie without writing about Gollum. He is my favorite character in the book, as he is a horrible monster and an old hobbit the ring has been torturing for 500 years at the same time. I always pitied him. Gollum has been made CG on this movie, though his motions and words come from actor Andy Serkins. On screen Gollum looks quite like how I pictured him, although his ears are too big and blue eyes do not suit him, especially as his eyes were green in the previous film. Serkins also provides great acting, especially when monster Gollum and his inner hobbit Smeágol argue. Kind of reminds me of the Green Goblin and Norman Osborne in Spider-Man.Another great new character is Treebeard the ent, who is also mostly computer-generated. John Rhys-Davies´s voice fits him, but it´s too bad the ents are on-screen very little. Well, it gets paid off in the end. Rhys-Davies also plays Gimli the dwarf who is now the comic relief of the movie, when Merri and Pippin are most of the time in the woods with the ents, where they have nothing to joke about. It doesn´t bother me, Gimli´s jokes are funnier, although he hasn´t got as good a comment as in the previous film; "Nobody tosses a dwarf!"Most of the running time is spend in the kingdom of Rohan, where Théoden tries to avoid war against evil wizard Saruman´s uruk-hai armies. It´s not all boring, but the second hour seems to last much longer than the first or the third. Jackson has spiced up the dullest parts of the book by adding a fight against orcs riding wargs, kind of hyena-like beasts and Aragorn and Arwen missing each other.The last hour is the best of this film and the whole trilogy so far. First, there´s the massive battle of Helm´s deep. The despair of the defenders feels in the air as 100 000 uruk-hais and orcs march in front of the fort and start shouting to taunt their opponents. It´s hard to believe most of those soldiers are CG. The viewer feels like s/he´s in the battle itself and dives even deeper to despair when the enemy breaks the walls and beats the hell out of Rohan´s soldiers. But in the morning, when Gandalf rides in with the Riders of Rohan the viewer´s despair changes to joy and relief. Peter Jackson sure can create great feelings. Although the film is not as good as the first one, it doesn´t deserve anything less, than the full points.10/10The best part (SPOILER): The final march of the ents. I felt very good seeing the tree people finally paying back to Saruman by coming to his fortress, Eisengard, and starting to wreck the place up! STOMP! Orcs get squashed! WHAM! Orcs get crushed under a big rock thrown by an ent! KER-SPLOOSH! The ents break the dam and the river sweeps all the smaller creatures into Saruman´s mine pit! It can´t get any better than this! Oh, I can´t wait for the third and final movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's NOT a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When The Two Towers was released last year, I was incensed to read respectable film critics refer to it as a sequel. Now I read that Howard Shore's soundtrack was refused consideration for an Academy Award, because it was "A sequel". I re-iterate, The Two Towers is NOT a sequel. Rocky 2 was, Jaws 2 also. These were films intended for a one off showing but because of their success, sequels quickly followed. This is not the case with LOTR. Tolkien's epic was so big that it required 3 books to tell. Peter Jackson realised too much would be sacrificed if he condensed the 3 books into one film. so he made his story approx 10 hours long, divided into 3 parts, not sequels. And despite what a lot of other contributors have said about TTT, i must add that they must have been watching something else, as it is a staggering achievement in cinema. Roll on The Return of the King</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the books twice and enjoyed the experience, have seen both movies several times and enjoyed that experience too. For me neither reading a book or watching a film is necessarily a passive experience, to get the most out of some things in life you have to allow your imagination (if you have one) to immerse itself in the thing as a whole and just let it flow. This story does that, it is a grand journey to take if you allow it be, or else it is a tedious trek with stones in your shoes if you prefer things that way. The films live up to that vision and are beautifully made, well-acted and visually stunning, and capture the spirit of the books as well as is possible with film - or, if you prefer it, long poncy movies with not enough obvious entertainment value and/or (gasp shock horror} not absolutely perfect in every miniscule detail. The choice is yours, but I can't help feeling a bit sorry for all those in group 2. To the rest of you: bloody brilliant, eh?</fullReview>

I like the books, but I see too many similarities with the special effects of the ones that are represented in the two latest Star Wars movies, which are completely made by computers. I don't like that. Nobody has realized that models combined with computer effects still can make the special effect look better and more real. There are a lot of impressive segments in the movie, BUT those are models or partially at least! Also, since the beginning of the franchise the character development has turned into a shallow action movie, which would be OK if it was as funny as Army of Darkness, but it's so obvious that this was meant to be the action movie and this is in fact not Army of Darkness. Who can take this movie seriously? It's on the verge of an overkill in the size of the one in the movie "Hero".The only character which gets more vivid than ever is Gollum, who sounds and looks good, that is when he's sitting still. If you can't see that he is computer animated when he's moving with the two hobbits you should get new glasses right away, maybe in the size of Gollum's eyes. as in the last movie I like almost all the actors though. The war sequences are the best thing in the movie, but what the f**k, is that the most important thing? Then also the Ents are quite funny, probably the most Bombastic episode of the Muppets show so far?I found this movie very entertaining, but far too much Hollywood. I like the limy Brits, but please, less bombastically delivered lines. All these Americans on New Zealand make feel like they'll stop by the 7 eleven or Burger King in the next part for a snack, cause that's what this movie is: fast food and instant entertainment. Nothing wrong in that, but with a couple of extra strokes with the brush it wouldn't be so obvious. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second movie of the trilogy is as good if not better than the first, but for the absence of Boromir(Sean Bean). I find the movie absolutely riveting and have watched it numerous times. I now have my husband hooked after explaining the story lines a few times. I read the books which made it easier to follow but to see the characters on screen just makes it even better. Hurry up #3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best films ever made, despite it's flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSMy only problem with this film is that some of Jackson's changes to the text don't seem to serve any purpose. His decision to have the elves show up at Helms Deep is perhaps understandable: it makes the victory more believable, the fight more entertaining and adds to the feeling that this is a world war, and thus involves all the races in it.However, Aragorn's tumble over the cliff does not seem to serve any purpose. He falls, there is some drama about about his loss, and then he gets on a horse and rides to Helms Deep alone. Am I the only one who does not see the point in this? It seems to me to be un-neccessary and un eventful aside to the story.My other problem is with Jackson's changes to the tale of the Ents. In the book the Ents plan from the start to overthrow Isengard, but in the film they attack on a split second decision, when they see the damage Saruman has done to the trees of Isengard. However, why doesn't Treebeard make this decision when he passes Isengard mid way through the film, in clear view of Orthanc and the ruin around it?Apart from these two (in my view) un-neccessary changes to Tolkien's text, this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made: beautifully filmed, full of great, driven performances and some of the best actions sequences ever committed to celluloid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in utter shock! After reading some of the comments on The Lord Of The Rings:The Two Towers, I am amazed to find so much criticism. The Two Towers is an absolute masterpiece from Peter Jackson, who did not have the easiest job in the world! Shooting the middle installment from a trilogy is not easy as there is no real beginning and no real end, so the final product I think is pure brilliance. From the city of Edoras which was purposefully built for this film, to the truly amazing Gollum created by special effects and a very good performance from British actor Andy Serkis, to the incredible Battle of Helms Deep, this film is stunning. Viggo Mortensen gives a fantastic performance as Aragorn, the fearless leader and future king of Gondor, and with superb performances from Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davis (Gimli), Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Bernard Hill (The King) to name a few, there is nothing to fault. Not forgetting of course the emotional return of Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the introduction of one of the most amazing characters that Tolkien invisioned, Tree Beard. Films like The Lord Of The Rings allow us to be like children again, to forget about our reality and go into a new land of mythical creatures and foreign places, even just for a few hours. To bring Tolkiens masterpiece to the big screen was a huge challenge, one that Peter Jackson agreed to and came out champion. I thoroughly look forward to the final installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I didn't enjoy the first of the Lord of the Rings films, I was eager to see the second, because the reviews were so terrific. I was terribly disappointed. I'd never read the Tolkien books--maybe that would have helped, I dunno. I do know that I found the plot hard to follow at times, and some of the dialog was hard to understand. But what really bothered me most was how cliche-ridden the film was--characters giving each other meaningful looks out of a grade Z flick, characters whose good or evil qualities screamed out at you, music that was laughably heavy handed, etc. For me, there were only two strong points: the battle scenes gave an unusually good sense of what combat was like long ago, and the special effects were impressive, especially the computer-enhanced character of Smeagol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the trilogy---7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers continues the story from the Fellowship of the Ring, but it has a lot more action. The first one took a while to get started and didn't have many epic battles. Regardless, it was a great movie. The second installment has got much more action and the end battle at Helm's deep is amazing. The cast and crew still do an excellent job with acting and special effects. I do have a couple of complaints. The movie didn't continue the story as much as it could have. Other than Gollum becoming a more important character, you probably could have skipped this one and caught up quickly in the third film, but you would have missed out on some great scenes. I also did not like the walking-talking trees. I found them boring and a little irritating as they didn't do much. Other than those forgivable flaws, this is a fantastic adventure that makes you drool in anticipation for the conclusion. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see the big, big fans of the books reaching for their tomes to knock me over the head for this comment! The film didn't portray books 3 and 4 exactly - in fact they went quite a way off it - but they reflected my experience of reading the books, given the difference between the two mediums.Peter Jackson has bought a book to film which has always been thought impossible to film, given the scale of the battles, the landscapes, and the creatures, who were bought so much to life that film-making couldn't do them justice.I definately wouldn't have been in the slightest bit interested in the films if I hadn't seen the books, but as I know them pretty well, it is clear that this is a labour of love from someone who knows and appreciates them at least as much as I do.Specifics - gollum is not quite as I imgined him but it is another person's vision of the books. In the first film I remembered most of the dialogue and scenes in the literary context - quite uncanny - and in the second, this is not the case. I recognised very few quotes. Rohan was beautifully realised. Helm's Deep was again not my vision but still faithful to the books.Certain things I missed - Gimli's role at Helm's Deep andhis reaction to the caves. He has been played for laughs all the way through, which is a pity as the books portray him as part of a distinct culture in Middle Earth, and here he is played as a small clown. His character has it's own concern's which are lost here.The numbers defending Helm's Deep were wrong - there were more originally. The alliance with the wild men disappeared, as it was they who turned the tide of battle (elves didn't really come into it).A lot of elements of the book such as the above have been dropped in Two Towers, presumable because it was thought that too many different elements and groups being introduced would confuse audiences.However the effect is that Middle Earth, which is a fully-realised world in he books seems to be rather small here. As someone else has said, the books are a portrait of Middle Earth as much as anything else, and the films fall down a bit. Perhaps there are pressures form producers who want as much mass appeal as possible - hence allowing Jackson the special editions which are perhaps more as he would have wanted them, and which hold more detail than the cinema releases.Having said that, it's easy to criticise, and it's an absolutely stunning film which does the books proud. I hope that P. Jackson manages to steer the third film more back towards the books though, becasue the books are great and a brilliant film doesn't need to do any more than that. Whatever, see the films in the cinema as well as on DVD, as they are a cinematic experience to end all others. Top marks.</fullReview>

If though both films are watched back to back, then the lack of character exposition and less emphasis on character development in the second instalment is forgivable. Almost great but as a stand alone movie it doesn't work, without the context of watching integral to the whole it fails, such is the fate of epic films released in instalments.

		<fullReview>There are no other words to describe the second of J.R.R.Tolkien's trilogy brought to life by Peter Jackson. This film is even better than the Fellowship of the Ring.Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum steals the show from other worthycontenders. The agony Gollum/Smeagol experiences as he triesto decide his allegiances can be felt by the audience. The epic and climatic battle scene, which takes up the last hour ofthis classic, has to rank right up there with some of the other greatbattle scenes which movie audiences have witnessed. I personally cannot wait to see what Jackson has in store for uswith The Return of the King. One thing's for certain we won't be disappointed if the first twoinstallments are anything to go on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where are those who loved this movie?! All I read was criticism about this film. Some people need to speak up and end this loud noise of film bashers. There were some truly great moments that didn't consist of great special effects or georgeous scenery. The scene where the king stands before his son's grave. The scene where it appeared that the evil orcs were going to get in and overtake the castle and the children listened in horror. The scene where Mortgenson and Tyler's hearts are breaking because they have to say goodbye to each other, and those moments when they dream about each other. Those INVOLVE the viewer(or at least they did me).The battles were just incredible and truly jawdropping. I may be the only one amazed by this film's grandeur but frankly other people can pry and pick on the film all they want. This film DID deserve to be nominated for an Oscar and can be quite powerful unless you got an ax to grind. I bought the dvd and it was money well spent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, except it's not quite the Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading the previous reviews of this movie and I was quite fascinated to find such varying comments and opinions. But, after (buying) watching this movie, I think I understand...If we ignore the fact that this movie was adapted from a book, and focus solely on it's merits as a movie - then I would say that it was excellent. The special effects, the battle scenes, the acting was all very good. Even the story, compared to the trash that's been produced recently (American Wedding, T3, Spiderman, Dare Devil, STAR TREK NEMESIS, STAR WARS II) was good. I would say there is very little out there in the fantasy genre that is better than this.However, this movie IS based on a book - A VERY GOOD BOOK. Changes that vary from the book ache that much more. More importantly, many changes that were made were extremely "Hollywood". A little more action, more special effects at the cost of a shallower, less fulfilling story. The story was simplified, altered for no reason other than to try to fit in a few more obligatory "dramatic" scenes that were cliche, un-original. It cheapened the story. And for those of us who have read the book, such departures are like a slap in the face. And missing scenes serve to heighten our disappointment.So... a good movie but not nearly as good as it COULD'VE (should've?) been. Worth a matinee watching, worth buying the DVD - BUT READ THE BOOK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I did like TTT better than FOTR. I think it's a darker picture. It's a shame it didnt pick up any oscars. I thought the movie dragged a little the first hour, but it's just in a class by itself. Only George Lucas' Star Wars compares to this series. Old school movie making. Peter Jackson is ok as a director but no one can knock his vision. He has a lot of it, and he did stray away from certain parts of the book, and created his own material, but hey, thats an adaptation for you. TTT continues from where FOTR left off, and the final hour of this movie will be talked about for a long time. Nothing compares to this not even the jedi battle in Attack of the clones. Peter Jackson gets knocked for his choppy direction, but he can get a lot out of his actors and that is what all great directors do. I think the other great thing about this film that also sets standards other than the final battle is the amazing "Gollum/Speagle" character. CGI has come a long way. One day, an oscar will be presented to one. Gollum probably deserves one! Not only did he look so real, he stole a lot of scenes, and is amazing to see how movies have progressed. Of course this movie gets **** stars out of ****. Passionate movie making, nothing short of perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a rating of 8, only two notches down from the perfect 10 score for "The Fellowship of the Ring." With this film, there's little doubt left that Peter Jackson has surpassed the original "Star Wars" trilogy in terms of passion, excitement, visual originality, and storytelling power. What a great accomplishment is "The Two Towers." It'll be tough waiting another three months for "The Return of the King," which I'm sure will be the best of the three films. (The "LOTR" film cycle has one huge advantage over "Star Wars": Jackson won't be revisiting his original masterwork with any badly written, badly acted, unnecessary prequels.)"Two Towers" does not follow the middle book in Tolkien's epic trilogy as closely as some might like, and does take a few liberties here and there, but overall this is a fine adaptation and, let's face it, probably the greatest sequel in film history. Jackson once again successfully creates a believable yet fanciful vision of Middle Earth; his special effects, while not quite as seamless as in "FOTR," are nonetheless impressive, and there's great magic in the cinematography, set design and music. The acting is also a level of magnitude above that seen in the last "Star Wars" picture. Each actor is able to make his or her character unique and believable within the terms of the story. This movie probably comes the closest of any to resembling a perfect marriage between art and blockbuster entertainment.All of that said, "TTT" (as it is popularly known) isn't quite as smoothly paced as "FOTR." The first 15-20 minutes are a bit choppy; we're thrown from one end of the story to the other in a somewhat frantic attempt to bring us up to speed. And, more than "FOTR," the second film feels like it needs footnotes -- in fact, after seeing it in a theater, I went out and read all three books, just so I could have a deeper understanding of this particular film.So I look forward to the extended DVD release, which I understand contains 40 minutes of additional footage. I think "TTT" will benefit from the restored footage; this is one of the few epics that might actually make greater sense with a more leisurely pace."The Lord of the Rings" trilogy is without a doubt the most exciting and important movie franchise of at least the last 20 years. I could give a rip about "Spider-Man" and "Harry Potter" ... what makes Jackson's films special is that they tell a complex, moral story in terms of a magnificent adventure. If the scenes dealing with Shelob in "ROTK" are anywhere near as good as the Balrog/Battle of Helms Deep sequences in the first two, then this beauty is only gonna get better.</fullReview>

Got an advance copy on video last week but no one had time to sit down and watch the thing until the weekend, and not until late into the evening at that. I intend to file a more comprehensive review when I get a chance to watch the whole movie toward the end of the week. But what I saw, which was good if a bit talky, left me with two thoughts worth sharing with anyone who does not blindly adore this second installment: Far too much time was spent with the humans and too little time with the Hobbits. And Gollum should have been an animatronic creation, or an actor in costume. Brian Henson could have done a heckuva job with this creature. Instead we get yet another "clever" CGI character, which while well executed ended up being distracting. Just look at Dobby (spelling?) in HARRY POTTER II. Same problem, a problem that was absolutely unnecessary. Children perhaps adore these cartoon characters, but they simply don't work for adult viewers. Of course I also realize these movies are not necessarily aimed at adult viewers. Ah well. Small quibbles, and not everyone is going to agree with me. Until the next time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are an avid fan of LOTR books and you understood em', than you'll love this movie. I personally thought that this movie was better in the sense that it had more fierce battle scenes, new characters,etc. Most people say Fellowship was better because it had a greater variety of places.True, but this is how the book was meant to be, no more lenghty explanations or introduction. I can see how people who've never read the books not enjoy as much as I did maybe because the film makers did not give cleaner or further explanations as to what was going on.With me, I sat down and watched it and knew exactly what was going on.My brother, who'd never read the books, didn't understand everything like smeagol's past, about saruman, ents, etc.So my advice, read the books first ( of course they are much better than the movies, which is saying a crap lot about how good these books are ) and then watch the movie. Or if you've already watched, read the books, and watch it again and then you'll understand better what's going on and enjoy it a ton more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I hoped for, but fun none-the-less (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed to see the ending of this film. The Two Towers is my favorite book of all time because of this one chapter, the very last chapter in the book (The Choices of Master Samwise). Of course, this chapter didn't make it into the movie, which only makes me want to see The Return of the King all the more.I have loved the trilogy ever since I first picked it up to find out what it was about. And seeing Peter Jackson's vision of it made me wish there wasn't copyright laws for some things. Of course, I enjoyed it, but the only problem was it didn't have everything I wanted to see (i.e. Tom Bombadil).There are many things I LOVED about the movie, The Two Towers. For one, it took a step up with CGI animation. Gollum was incredible. I have never seen a CGI look more real. (To be honest, I think CGI looks so fake, I wished they would go bask to the day when creatures where made with puppets. They looked unbelievably real, compared to CGI.)Now, no movie is perfect, and The Two Towers proves that. All movies do. The five chapters they didn't put in probably has a reason for it being that way, and I think I know why. The Return of the King is by far the shortest in the trilogy, so I think the production team decided that why cram everything into The Two Towers, when you could leave some out and put it in the next one. I mean, the movie is already long (some people might take it as far as unbearably long, but I have to say that I though it was short), so they didn't want people to get up and leave because they were bored (I'm talking about the mainstream audience), so they move some of the movie over to The Return of the King.I can easily say that The Two Towers is one of my favorite movies of all time, but, like any other movie, it is flawed. Luckily, it's nowhere as flawed as The Hulk (I could barely sit through that movie, and it was much shorter that The Two Towers). I really think that the movie could have done better, but, then again, it could have done horribly worse....As I wrap this up, I have to say that I absolutely enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The Ent's looked pretty real, compared to other things. The battle of Helm's Deep wasn't as character-driven as the book was, but it was one awesome piece of film-making. The part at Osgiliath, where Frodo realizes without Sam, he would never have got near as far as they did, touched my heart. Especially, when Sam told Frodo that the hope that they had left was that there was still some good left in the world. I even liked when they talked about the story that was going to be told about themselves (which wasn't supposed to be included until the third one. Just pause for a moment and feel the irony in that). All in all, this was an enjoyable piece of film-making that everyone, and I mean everyone (except of the little kids, I mean, it can get as gory as a PG-13 movie can get) should see this movie. ****(out of four stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paintbrushes Forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship of the Ring reached magical depths that one cannot fathom how they were forgotten in this, The Two Towers. How could have the makers of such a beautiful portrait of Middle Earth as was the first movie have put their aesthetically sophisticated, spiritually dipped paintbrushes away for ones to portray this more prosaic vision of Middle Earth?The first one included infinite more scenery - the vividly green and blue Shire bathed in sunshine, the dark and scary mines of Moria, the dark greens and greys of Lothlorien, the balming peace and ethereal architecture of Rivendell, the black and red terror of Barad-dur, the grey eeriness and further terror of Isengard unleashed, the silent threat of the Great River Anduin, the false safety of the cheerful Bree, and the trodding across said lands and the lands in between, like the snowy white Misty Mountains (my favorite scenes), and the lands surrounding Weathertop.The second one was little more than grey and brown terrains - beautiful, but sorely in need of others to contrast them.The Fellowship of the Rings was more suspenseful. Who were those Black Riders? Were they not infinitely more terrifying than any of the orcs that came out in the second film? The Ring was prominent in the first film. What could it do to that who owned it? The second film gave little time or thought to the Ring.The first one was much more exciting. Being chased by Black Riders through the woods at night, listening to their chill wails? Fighting them? Being chased by orcs and a troll in the mines and by Uruk-hai above ground? How can an "epic battle" such as Helm's Deep stand up to such uniqueness?The exclusion of the hobbits from the majority of the film seemed also most unjust to me. Although Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is a rich character with fathomless depths who deserves prominence in the story, this was not a reason to rob Elijah Wood's brave little protagonist Frodo of starring the major emotions and perils in this story, which after all, is mostly his, as well as the other hobbits. Frodo is a very deep character as well who represents the virtues of innocence and perseverance, virtues he could turn his back on more easily than Legolas or Aragorn perhaps, who have more ease when facing danger, but chooses not to.Aragorn is a major character observed in the books, observed through the eyes of Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam, who themselves are the ones living and feeling the peril described by Tolkien. That Aragorn might seem more apt to action sequences seems a bit absurd to me; it is scads more exciting to see these tiny, little beings flee and fight the way they did in the first film (when arriving to the Brandywine Crossing).And even if they did spend arduous expanses of time trudging, there was something to be said for it. Endurance, perseverance, moving forward instead of collapsing with utter fatigue...The first movie allowed the audience to weep - weep with emotion when Arwen charged across woods and plains in order to save Frodo and save hope for the entire world, weep when she wept for Frodo weeping for innocence lost, weep when the noble protector Gandalf fell into the darkness of Moria, weep at the sheer beauty of the crossing of the Misty Mountains, weep sympathizing with Boromir's fright... In the second one only Theoden's grief for his son mattered much.The first movie included meaningful expressions - Legolas' terrified face when encountering the Balrog, Galadriel's lust after the ring, Frodo's, Bilbo's and Gandalf's impish blue eyes sharpen when detecting Sauron's sultry whispers while discussing the Ring, Boromir's quailing before Galadriel, Gimli's shock and grief at finding his relatives killed by orcs... The second one had Merry near to tears when reproaching the Ents, and Eowyn's beautiful, anxious face, but not much else.The second movie was much like Braveheart since it focused entirely too much around the story of Helm's Deep and the people of Rohan. These scenes were fantastic, but they should have been pruned down to much shorter time, and much more time (and emotion) should have been given to the hobbits' stories (even Gollum got more time than Frodo and Pippin it seemed). I would have loved to see much more of Fangorn, Isengard and Mordor than of Rohan, which deserved a substantial but not all encompassing slice. For stories about brave humans abound and will continue to be made, but there is only one that I know of that includes hobbits and elves. I hope directors and producers will eventually learn that international audiences at large will appreciate the finer webs of which the first film was made than the obvious ones of the second.A rather odd thing to be such a fan for a person who generally reads only non-fiction...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It's epic, inspiring, but it still manages to keep its feet on the ground. The tale of Frodo and his companions is beautifully told, and the actors take full advantage of the material they are given.Gollum definitely steals the show. Andy Serkis gives Gollum such pathos that you end up feeling very, very sorry for him. Helm's Deep was breathtaking, and the movie as a whole does not suffer too much from being the middle film. The very short introduction serves as a reminder, and then the viewer is plunged back into Middle Earth.</fullReview>

There were complaints about the first film as to how true it was to the book (what no Tom Bombadil?) but the second whilst still not flawless, how picky can i be? is a great testament to the cast and crew and their obvious desire to produce a cinematic feast and produce something J R R Tolkein would have been proud of. Without being too fussy i really cannot fault the acting, scenery, direction and the absolute grandeur of it all. top ten film if there ever was one!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that can do justice to what I consider the best book of all time gets a 10/10. Possible bad things Faramir's character is changed substantially, from one of my personal favorite characters to what amounts to another Boromir. I hope they attempt to rectify that in ROTK. I have a feeling they will. Also, having Frodo and Sam go to see Denethor was uncalled for, and I am not sure what that accomplished. Definite good things--Gollum/Smeagol is the most complex, (bizzarre?) character I can think of in literature, and PJackson got it dead on. Try watching the Phantom Menace, and how crappy of a job they did with Jar Jar, among other things, and then watch this, and tell me the effects aren't better. Or Attack of the Clones, or the Hulk, or pretty much any other movie ever made, with exceptions I cannot think of. Holy cow. Smeagol might have every psychological disease known to man. The dialogue/confrontation between Smeagol, Sam, and Frodo was superb. Aragorn was awesome. Pretty much everything was awesome. People complain about the Ent sequences being slow, but if you read the book, it seems to drag on there, too. I mean seriously, don't be so hasty. I thought FOTR was also excellent, but that this one was better. Not sure why, but I think it's because I just like the last two thirds of the book better than the exposition (FOTR). Anyway, this is the best movie I have ever seen, and I expect it to remain that way for about 4 more months until ROTK comes out. And for crying out loud people, READ THE BOOK TOO!

		<shortDescription>Great Visualisation...Bad Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Spoilers**** The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues where the first one left off, Frodo and Sam headed east through Emyn Muil towards Mordor to destroy the Ring while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow the trail of the Uruk-hais who have capture Merry and Pippin, heading West through the vast Plains and Rohan. Along the way, they are reunited with Gandalf, who then takes them towards Edoras, where Theoden King lives. From there, Gandalf leaves to find Eomer while the other three travel with the city towards Helms Deep, where an epic battle is going to take place. While all this happens in the West, Frodo and Sam meet with Gollum, who tries to steal the Ring from them in the night. He promises to lead them towards the Black Gates and into Mordor himself, all the while, unbeknownst to the two hobbits, is battling with himself to gain control (Smeagol over Gollum, Gollum over Smeagol). When they cannot enter through the Black Gates, Smeagol/Gollum leads them another way in but the two hobbits are soon taken by Faramir, a ranger of Gondor and the deceased Boromir's brother. Near the end of the movie, they are taken to Osgiliath where Nazgul are attacking. In the end, Faramir does let them continue back towards Mordor alone instead of taking them to Minas Tirith, as was planned.I think it was a very good visual of the second installment of this epic trilogy written by the great J.R.R Tolkien, which is supposed to have been the first fantasy novel which most things are faintly based on. Although the ending was...far from where it really was, it was great all-around, succeeding in a breath-taking visualisation not yet seen in any fantasy film and greatly matching the success of the first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring. Out of all of the movie, I was far from pleased with the endings of both the West and East journeys, that are separated into two parts in the book, which ended half way through the original two parts. Altogether though, even with the bad ending, it was very well made and deserves as high a praise from fans as the first installment did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to Faramir ????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first film and could barely wait for this movie to be released. Well I was entertained (and this is by no way a bad movie) there are a few issues I have with it.The first and most obvious being Faramir. Faramir is supposed to be the opposite of his brother, strong and not prone to the usual weaknesses of men. But Peter Jackson portrays him as being corrupted by the ring as soon as he sets eyes on it. Yes, he does eventually let Frodo go but there was no need for this alteration to have ever been made. It really spoiled the film for me.The only other big thing was the ENT's. This didn't bother me as much as Faramir, but it was still an unnecessary change from the book. The ENT's are supposed to agree in the ENT Moot that they will fight in the war - not the way they do it in the film. Oh yeah - and the attack on Isengard, I know its difficult in film to show ENT's digging a new path for a river over a couple of days - but what idiot builds his fortress next to a massive, crumbling dam ???Winging over. Apart from these major (and a couple of minor points) I did still enjoy the film and probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't already read the books. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film-- a not so brilliant adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one takes LOTR:TTT on it's own, without judging it against the original source, it's everything one could ever hope for. It's visually gorgeous, and the acting is simply incredible. Special points go to Brad Dourif's EXCELLENT portrayal of Grima Wormtounge, and to Christopher Lee's Saruman. Lee has just the right mix of truly awe-inspiring evil and petty villainy. Let's hope that in the next film, the twisted relationship of these characters is maintained. Viggo Mortensen is the heart and soul of this fim-- though Aragorn seems slightly out of character, this is no fault of Mortensen's...he's a truly talented actor who has made a rather static fictional character his own.However...this IS an adaptation of Tolkien's work, right? So one would hope for a certain...adherence to the original. Making the ten page sequence at Helm's Deep into about half the film was a bit much, but I can handle it. Leaving out Shelbob, Saruman yelling out the window, and Pippin and the palintiri...well, okay. Moving Boromir's death to the end of FOTR...I'll get over it. But...Faramir. Oh, sweet god, Peter Jackson, what did you do to Faramir!?Now, I just said I didn't mind the way Mortensen developed the character of Aragorn beyond the bare outlines in the book. This is because he maintained true to the basic things that make Aragorn ARAGORN. (Or Strider, or Elessar, or Estel, or Dunadan, or Elfstone, or whatever the heck he's calling himself now.) But Faramir--and this is no fault of David Wenham's, he did an excellent job with what he was given-- what happened to Faramir amounts to character assassination! They made him...BoromirLite, not the sensitive, completely individual character that he was intended to be. And that, I think, is the movie's biggest flaw-- turning a peaceful character like Faramir into a warrior like his brother is ignoring everything that Tolkien is trying to say...Faramir's differences from Denethor and Boromir are what make much of the plot of ROTK, but it's not set up for that now. (Plus, we're minus one giant spider, one palantir-sneaking hobbit, and one VERY imperiled Ringbearer at the moment.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, while I enjoyed the first installment of the LOTR movies, The Two Towers really overshadows Fellowship- but I'm not saying Fellowship was bad, oh no. It made for a wonderful introduction to the characters and places of Middle-Earth, and now that's out of the way, let the action begin!The Two Towers, I think, is a wonderfully brilliantly made film- the special effects are wicked cool, the characters develop more in their relationships, and the war to keep the free peoples of the land free has begun. The Battle of Helm's Deep is probably the coolest scene in the entire movie, and it's definitely worth sitting 3 hours for. Also, the CG for Gollum is INCREDIBLE! Many a person has walked out of the theater ending up loving that pitiful creature, and how could they not with the brilliant way that WETA has brought our favorite Slinker/Stinker to life.In short, this is a must see. Even if you weren't so keen on Fellowship, and you're more of an action sort of person, TTT is definitely what you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe second film in Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien's classic trilogy The Lord of the Rings is every bit as much a triumph as the first. Wisely eschewing the `previously-on-The Lord of the Rings' type nonsense that so often wastes valuable screen time in such works, Jackson literally hurls you straight back into the plot, as Gandalf battles the Balrog in a stunning opening duel. Some have criticised this lack of a re-cap as being insensitive to those who haven't read the book or seen the first film. However, I've no sympathy for anyone who's not done at least one of those two. Anyone coming to The Two Towers with no previous knowledge would soon get hopelessly lost in any case.The plot follows threes strands. First and foremost, it concerns Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor as they attempt to put and end to the Ring. They are guided by the Ring's previous owner Gollum, a twisted, demented creature coming across like a schizophrenic drug addict. In the second plotline, Human Aragorn, Elf Legolas, and Dwarf Gimli search for the other Hobbits captured by Uruk-Hai in the previous installment. Along the way they enter the land of Rohan and help its beleaguered King Theoden fight Saruman's evil army of Uruk-Hai. The third plot strand follows the plight of Hobbits Pippin and Merry (whom Aragorn and his companions seek) as they escape the Uruk-Hai and befriend the mysterious Ent Treebeard, a walking talking tree.Given the extreme difficulty in adapting The Two Towers as a film, Peter Jackson has done an incredible job creating a coherent film. He wisely opted to end the film short of where the book ends (the latter chapters of the book will take place in the third film). Certain elements of the book he has tweaked (most notably the character of Faramir, Boromir's brother) to, in my opinion, good effect.Performance wise, the high standard set by the first film continues. All the characters from the first film are just as good, if not better here. New characters Theoden (the splendid Bernard Hill), Eowyn (Mirando Otto) and Faramir (David Wenham) are all brilliantly brought to live. Worthy of special mention is the fantastic rendering of Gollum, without doubt the best CGI character ever created.The special effects continue to stun. I always thought the army of Ents storming Isengard would be impossible to put on film - I was wrong. Also, the battle of Helms Deep is a triumph - a stunning battle which more than lives up to its counterpart in the book. The production design, editing, sound and cinematography are as impressive as ever.Howard Shore's score is nothing less than a work of genius in its own right. From the heroic Rohan theme to the melancholic and haunting Gollum's song, this is an unparalleled work. Less immediately showy than Fellowship's themes (some of which are briefly reprised here) this ultimately gets under one's skin more than the music of the first film (no mean feat).All in all, this is another triumph. Darker and more action packed than its predecessor, The Two Towers is a great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic. It's weighty themes of immortality, betrayal, genocide, temptation and sacrifice and nicely balanced by a great sense of humour that runs throughout. Gimli provides a lot of laughs, and one line by Treebeard (surprisingly not in Tolkien's book) offers a wonderfully bizarre but true observation - `I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.' Quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Violent, but Impressive Special Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It disappoints me that so many people thought this movie was great. Although the sets, costumes, and special effects are FANTASTIC, the movie can't stand on it's own! There's really no excuse for this - it's perfectly possible to tell a three-part story in parts that have a storyline and plot of their own. I found the movie to be tedious and had to continually explain what was supposed to be happening to the kids with me.Also, director Peter Jackson has a sadly different vision for The Lord of the Rings (LotR) than that of author J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien did not celebrate war, and while the heroic leader Aragorn practices it, it is out of necessity rather than a desire for glory. In the book, this makes the ambitious and aggressive warrior Boromir a foil for him and the scholarly Faramir. That is also why there are so few female leads in the book - the story is about the darkness of power-mongering and the decay of civilization - Tolkien's ideas of female characteristics were creativity, nurture, and management. The movie, on the other hand, relies heavily on the excitement of violent conflict as a substitute for plot and character development. That may make the film unintentionally relevant in today's political climate, but at a pitiful price. Tolkien was a scholar who had experienced the devastation of war (WWI) first hand, and returned to celebrate culture and the magic of language and history. He had a message that our times still need to hear.</fullReview>

When I read it, I was amazed at the beauty of world and characters. Frodo I felt was one of the best heroes in literature for the simple fact that all he did was plod, on and on to save what he loved, the Shire, we all can relate to this in a smaller sense.The movie I believe is the most visually asounding movie ever made. The special effects are flawless, Gollum being the best CGI ever, sets beautiful, and the shots just add to the beuaty. The music is amazing, and adds another level of brillance to the movie. The first time I saw this I had the same feeling that I had watching the great epics like Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars. I sat and admired the movie, the only times I do this is for the truely great movies like Citizen Kane, or 2001. By the end of the movie my jaw was dropped and I had only one complant, the same one I had with Casablanca, The Godfather and other classics, it's too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This entire three hour movie can be summed up in one word: AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And, by amazing I don't mean 'mostly good'. By amazing I don't mean 'could've been better'. By amazing I mean the template for perfection. Peter Jackson's second act of the trilogy, "The Two Towers" is not only three hours of eye candy, but three hour of ear candy, heart candy and any other kind of candy. As everyone knows, the second act is always the hardest, but Peter Jackson seemed to make this great film with ease.The story, continuing from "Fellowship", focuses on two plotlines: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis), who leads them to Mordor and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) helping the Rohirrihm. The writers did very well blending these two stories together, just like Tolkien did.The star of this movie is without a doubt Gollum. Even though he is a complete CGI character, he turns out to be the opposite of Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't comic relief, he isn't there for cute laughs, he is the same, tormented character as he was in the book.Of course, the action in this movie ranks up with "Braveheart" for great Medieval warfare. As most know, the last forty-five minutes of this movie is one long war scene. Despite being so long, it never becomes boring or cheesy, and you're never getting restless in your seat. In fact, you're on the edge of it the whole twenty-seven thousand seconds of it.This film still has faults though, as all do, but they are miniscule compared to the great brilliance. There are but two things in "Towers" that bugged me: the slightly overdone love story between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Gimli's (John Rhys-Davies) delve into comedy. I'm not saying that Gimli wasn't funny, I'm saying that he wasn't as dramatic as he should have been.As I said, the faults are tiny compared to the brilliance. "The Two Towers" never even comes close to disappointing, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing but still prefer the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well where to start. I have seen this film three times and look forward to seeing the extended edition and ROTK.I knew the shape of events that were likly to happen, in the film but was a little disappointed at a few things. First off and most importantly was Gandalfs battle with Balrog. I was utterly gobsmaked at that opening sequence, the fall to the centre of the earth the, brave wizard striking down his enemy on the mountian, but the thing that disappointed me was the missing part of it. in the book when they reach the bootom and hit water, the balrog becomes a muddy mess and he and gandalf engage in a long battle which leads to him having to hold on to balrog as he climbs back up. the thing is i had always thought that fight would be cool to wacth, seeing the centre of the earth which might have had the same dark sense of moria, the cool choir music nd the sight of gandalf clinging for his life to balrogs ankle (King Kong ring a bell) all so dark, would have the same feel as ALIEN. the sad thing is i don't think this will be on the extended edition either.now to the actors, this film belongs to Viggo Mortenson with Wood taking second place,i'm beginning to wonder which character is more important, part three is gonna be one hell of an upstageing war thats for sure. its sad that Liv Tyler is only in two scenes. Notable credit goes to Brad Dourif for his excellent portrayal of Grima Wormtouge.Helms deep is superb, climaxing with the horses charging down the moutain to the choir boys voice. and some amazing fight and death scenes.However i still like FOTR better, simply because the characters end up in different groups each one having to realise their destiny and go their separate ways. thats what life is for all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular, visual epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Millions of movie-goers were shocked when Fellowship of the Rings came out in theatres December 2001. It was hailed as a new level of fine filmmaking and lured more fans into the popular franchise. By December 2002, The Two towers hit the screen and most were not dissapointed.What sets this film apart from it's preceder is that the stakes are higher, and the danger in the characters adventures is clearer. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-Hai and meet up with the ents, Aragorn, legolas, and Gimli are on a hunt for them, and Frodo and Sam continue their way to Mt. Doom to destroy the One ring. Many new colorful characters such as Grima, Gollum, Eowyn, and Theoden are introduced in this film and seem to be meeting most of the Tolkien Purist's standards. The bloody Battle of Helms deep is one of the most spectacular battles ever filmed. The reality is so believable that many viewers might feel that they are a Rohan soldier themselves.One problem purists might have is the slight maipulation of the story. Chapters are missing, and some of the characters personalities are manipulated. Regardless, this film has won amazing praise in both loving fans and critics as well as receiving two Acadamy Awards last March.Although this film does not quite beat "Fellowship", it is still a spectacular, grand epic that will blow your mind. Everyone, young or old, deserves to see this movie to enjoy its true greatness.9.5/10</fullReview>

It was a great film that I think older kids will love and adults also. This makes you believe that maybe there is a middle Earth and Do frodo and sam destroy the ring in Mordor. This film will make you wait in line on the opening day in December 2003 I cant wait, and Peter Jackson is a directing Genius he made this film heart warming, scary, sad, and a film that u cant not see.Other movies I would Recommend: Legally Blonde 2, Pirates of the Carribean, Finding Nemo, and the Lord of the rings the fellowshipOther Movies I would not recommend: The hulk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it's really not necessary for someone else to add glowing comments to this already well-received movie, I've just got to add my voice. I think I liked "The Two Towers" more than "The Fellowship" (though the TTT and FOTR extended edition are neck-and-neck). It was darker than the first, more dramatic, more action-filled, and punctuated with more quiet moments of grief and beauty. I've never read the books, though I will after I've seen "Return of the King," so am going into these movies completely unspoiled and able to look at them as solely films. And they are great films. It was a pleasure to see my old favorite characters return - especially Aragorn and Sam, who really shined here. I also enjoyed every new character I've met in TTT, Theoden, Eowyn, Faramir, and, of course Gollum. From the sun-dried plains of Rohan to the besieged Osgiliath, every set was sprawling and beautiful. The scenes in Rohan were especially wonderful because of the dialogue, which sounded very Shakespearean, with all of the power plays for Theoden's throne and the need and fear of war against evil. TTT is a very timely movie, but Peter Jackson doesn't beat that point to a pulp. I can't wait to see more of Faramir and his situation in the extended edition, as that was the only point that I felt could've been explained more. I know it has something to do with his father. Anyhow, November and December seem so far away, and the wait for the next and last movie seems almost unbearable. However, I know I'll be really down when the end credits roll on "ROTK," as I wish this wonderful story would never reach its conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrown in with the other movies that come out each year, Two Towers was great! It had action, romance, and characters you can truly love.Two Towers, however, was not "just" another movie. It is the second part, third and fourth chapters of "The Lord Of The Rings." As such, a higher standard was expected than turned out. While I realize that some "poetic" license needed to be taken to make it understandable to the viewing public (plus to keep it under six hours!), I did not understand a lot of Peter Jackson's inclusions that weren't a part of the original story (such as the attack on the traveling Rohirrim), nor did I understand several of his omissions. The "hunky-dory"-style ending, where all was well with the world, if only for a minute, didn't strike me the right way. Jackson could have picked a better place to end the movie, as well... leaving those who haven't read the books hanging on the edge of their seats.I find it hard to see how Jackson will have time to cover everything he needs to to wrap it up in the third movie... and I am disconcerted to hear rumor that he will be cutting out one of the defining parts of the story that occurs near the end.Overall, I was expecting greatness, and walked away feeling a bit disappointed. I only hope "Return of the King" leaves me feeling complete about the whole thing.-NG038</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than the first. It had more adventure than the first. Aragon was the best in this movie because he was the best fighter in the movie. Legolas was great with his bow and arrow as well. The story of this movie is the same but it was had to deal with different types of characters like Golem where you actually see him as in the first movie there were only sounds and shadows of him. I liked Frodo in the first one better because he was braver in that one. Now he is all dazed and scared in this and he doesn't make the best out of his situation. I thought the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers should have had the group find each other and the fellowship would be back together. Gandalf, Aragon, Legolas and Gimlie are together, Frodo and Sam are together and Merry and Pippen are together. They are seperated into groups and I never read Return of the King so I can't really judge but I think they should be together. I thought it was a great movie and I recommend this movie to all viewers who are Lord of the Rings fans and like action adventure through out the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers is one of those rare movies that can grip the audience from beginning to end. As the middle chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved saga, Lord of the Rings, Two Towers offers vibrant characters, beautiful locations, and a truly emotional, gripping plot. From the time we see Gandalf falling down the depths of Kazad-dum to the last sobering shots of two hobbits hiking toward the ominous Mount Doom, we become one with the majesty of Tolkien's Middle Earth. This chapter chronicles the sundered Fellowship's adventures- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they try to save lush Rohan from the forces of the two towers; Pippin and Merry as they make new alliances in haunted Fangorn, and Frodo and Sam as they make an uneasy friend of the twisted Gollum as they trek towards Mt. Doom.With a top cast- Viggo Mortenson as the future king Aragorn, Christopher Lee as the treacherous Saruman the White, Andy Serkis as the complex Gollum, Elijah Wood who plays Frodo to the letter, and many more, the movie never once lags. It is further enhanced with beautiful music compliments of Howard Shore and the breathtaking views of locales such as celtic Edoras, industrial Isengard, and peaceful Rivendell. This is truly a movie that will be enjoyed for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this as much as I did "The Fellowship of the Ring." It looked like it was drastically edited at the last minute to meet time constraints, and some of the CGI/animation work was jarring. I'm still willing to give it a try on the "special edition" DVD (where I assume that scenes will be added back.)However, I get really nervous when I think about how *much* material still has to be covered. I'm also very concerned that some scenes in the first film that I think will be necessary to have the *last* scenes in "Return of the King" make sense were deleted in the theatrical release. And if we have yet another dwarf-tossing joke in ROTK, I'm probably going to throw something at the screen.All that said, this is an amazing project, and even if flawed it is worth seeing. It's not #10 on anyone's all-time best list (not when there are films like "Children of Paradise" and "Andrei Rublev" out there)... but the complete trilogy may hit close to that mark. And the acting remains excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers: 8/10As a Tolkien buff and having not been very impressed by the first installment of the movie series, I was a little wary watching this with my cousin at the cinema. However, I had a great time, and really enjoyed it. The flaws are still there, but because TTT is so action-based, it's more of an adrenaline rush. They minimized the comedy of Pippin and Merry, but Gollum just had to take over the obligatory western cinema comedy character who brings the ill-timed jokes, et. al. The part where he talked to himself (or his two selves) was deplorable. The last hour was strange, I kept saying "it's going to end now", but it kept going. It was really good and set up the sequel finale well though. I hear Return of the King will be even longer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent work, but not quite as good as the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start, ignore the fanboys who decry Peter Jackson's efforts as "Not Tolkien's story" or other such comments. Of course it isn't. It's Peter Jackson's version of it. That's why, apparently missed by the rabid Tolkien-ites, all such films, somewhere in their credits, have the comment "Based on the novel xxx by xxxx.....". So, given that it isn't intended to be a word-for-word rehash of the book, why shout it down for that?What the Two Towers is, however, is solid action-fantasy cinema that picks up right where the first movie finished and runs with the ball. Personally, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first movie, but then, it would have had to be fantastic to be so. All sequels are "more of the same" to an extent, so it's hard to be as good as the original, but this one comes pretty close.There were things I wished I could see more of in this movie, like the Ents attack on Isengard, or maybe where Gimli discovers the caves at Helm's Deep (which wasn't in there at all), but I'm hopeful that the extended DVD release will add little extras like this back into the story as the extended DVD of FOTR did.I was a little puzzled to see the Elves at Helm's Deep. I don't recall that from the book, but who cares really? It seemed logical that they would come to help. Nice addition.Gollum was a truly amazing piece of CGI. I don't think he looked THAT realistic, but what made him work for me was the expression that they got into his features. Amazing stuff, especially the "Good Smeagol, Bad Gollum" internal struggle. Incidentally, on a humorous note, there were people in the audience that didn't get that bit. I heard at least two people (adults) wondering out loud where the second Gollum came from!I also think that it was a shame Shelob didn't make it into this one. T'would have made a good cliff-hanger ending for the second film to have Frodo apparently dead and Sam alone. But as it was, those of us who know the story can know anticipate the appearance of Ungoliant's spawn in much the same way as we anticipated Gollum's appearance.If there was one thing that I'm not sure is a good idea, it's the increasingly acrobatic Legolas. I almost hate to think what he'll get up to in the final installment. But I'll still go and see it!All in all, this is a worthy follow-up to FOTR and well worth your time. It will certainly be making an appearance in my DVD collection as soon as the extended version is released.</fullReview>

I'm 12, at that time I was 11, I had read all the books, and seen the Fellowship like a bazillion times.My parents were going to take me to see The Two Towers the day it came out and we called and the theater and they said that people had been buying tickets like weeks in advance. And I live in a really small town. So a week later they took me to see it and it was still jammed packed. As soon as I saw it with my parents I dragged my sister with me so I could see it again, and then finally convinced my mom to take me again.This was totally the best movie ever. The Two Towers is my favorite movie ever, and with an older sister, trust me, I've seen a lot. It doesn't deserve any thing close to a 10 though, more like 1000. I can't wait for The Return of the King to come out. And when they say that it's better then the Two Towers, Well, that I will have to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was visually stunning and extremely entertaining. I mean... of course, it is. Even if you don't like the genre, you can't deny that it's an impressive piece of film making. Did I like it better than the The Fellowship of the Ring? Well I like them both, but for different reasons. The first movie seemed to have a little more character development. Mostly because we meet the characters for the first time and get to watch them start their quest. Part two is the middle. It's starts in the middle of the story and ends, still in the middle.The first film also seemed to center more on the whimsical life of hobbits and elves. This one has two of the hobbits stuck in a "tree" for most of the movie. I would have liked to see more of Merry and Pippin, but Gimli the dwarf helped pick up the slack in the comic relief department. This story is a bit darker and focuses more on the humans. Aragorn, helping to lead the good fight alongside the people of Rohan.The Two Towers certainly excels with the effects. More fighting, more creatures, more CG. Of course, ya gotta mention Gollum. He just rocks. Very creepy, yet somehow cute at the same time. Very realistic too. I know we all love Yoda, but his CG counterpart was designed to mimic a rubber puppet. Gollum breaks new ground, thanks to the performance of Andy Serkis. Apparently there was some controversy about whether or not he should be nominated for an Oscar. Sure it might seem strange to have a person win an acting award without actually being seen on screen... but he deserves it.Anyway, the battle at Helm's Deep is cool... the Ents are cool... it's all cool. Whether you like it more or less than Fellowship, remember that it's basically one story, split into three parts. Can't wait for the last installment. Then I can't wait to watch all the extended edition versions on DVD, back to back to back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YES! Two Towers IS in fact one of the best visual and exceptional epics of our age! NOBODY could've done it better than Peter Jackson!Here is a review of book and film (to distinguish the two)BOOK: Well written, but somewhat slow paced. As being a HUGE fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, I found that his style of writing picked up immensely as the stories went on. It took me three months to finish Fellowship, and only one to finish Two Towers. It was much more gripping and although I enjoyed chapters like Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and The Palantir. Certainly a great middle book to the series.MOVIE: Although not as faithful to the book as Fellowship, it remains true to Tolkien's world! I easily forgave Peter Jackson's changes in Faramir and Treebeard, since they were never really changed dramatically. It was, however, Smeagol/Gollum that takes this film over the top! He looks so real and feels so real you could swear that you could actually have a conversation with him! Wonderfully adapted.Expanding Helm's Deep was a great idea on PJ's part!Overall, it's better than Fellowship of the Ring, and makes me wish all the more that December wasn't so far away! I look forward to Return of the King, and eagerly anticipate the climactic finish in Mount Doom!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers is a brilliant film; it is not intended to be an exact replica of Tolkien's brilliant books (which I have read and consider to be amoungst the finest ever written) but instead it is a film adaptation. However it does suffer a little from sequel-itis; with the battle of Helm's Deep being drawn out for longer than necessary to 'jazz up' the closing parts of the film. Gollum, without a doubt, is the star of the film, brilliantly brought to life by a combination of computer effects and the work of actor Andy Serkis. Yes, it will be disapointing to some of Tolkien's fans who dislike the liberties Peter Jackson as taken with this book; but my opinion is that these changes have made the Two Towers both a darker film, and a more uplifting in places as characters make decisions that have a profound impact on their world.</fullReview>

Frodo and Sam remain together trying to protect the ring. And the good guys have an army to fight the Orcs.With stunning special effects, this movie was a lot beter than the first as said before. This one had way more acting. i did feel that some of the scenes that had comedy in it were unfitting for intense moments.Wood continues doing a good job as Frodo. McKellen makes a return as Gandolf and does a better, less boring act. The writing actually managed to improve and I hope it only gets better.Anyone who is a fan of the first movie will like this one, I recommend it to anyone who likes some fantasy/action/drama/adventure...etc. movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film improves with second viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching this for the first time I felt that the final hour was flawed. These problems however are not as important on second viewing. The main issue is that of editing. The battle of Helm's Deep is clearly the major set piece of the film, however it is unfortunately interrupted by other scenes, that is those involving Merry, Pippen and Frodo. These interruptions lead to a clear loss in momentum and tension. When you watch this film again though the problem is not that important, because on repeat viewings you are concerned less with tension anyway and focus more on the vision of the film makers.One of the most interesting things about the endings is how dark it is. When first viewing the film it is easy to come away thinking that it had ended in a happy, and perhaps overly sentimental manner. This is so if you take away the film's final five minutes. However the scene of Gollum and Smeagol deciding to kill Frodo and Sam is at almost polar opposites to the scene involving Frodo and Sam which came before and means that we should be able to look forward to a final film which isn't just a plain action film, but relying equally on characterisation and visual artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers isn't a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, it's a direct continuation and it's every bit as brilliant, if not more. Just make sure you've seen Fellowship before seeing this movie. The fellowship established in the first film has been broken. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue to Mordor, being guided by Gollum, the first truly believable computer animated character. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) make new allies and launch an assault on Isengard. The Two Towers features a breathtaking atmosphere, amazing character development, and one of the most visually outstanding battle sequences in motion picture history. A must see.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers was just as good as the novel and the first. The Two Towers has more action with effects we have never seen in our wildest dreams. The story keeps getting better and makes us wonder what will happen next. I cannot believe how emotional I felt about this movie, let alont the entire trilogy! I cannot wait for The Return of the King to arrive into theaters. This is the sequel of a classic that is appreciated by everyone with great taste in movies and stories. The Two Towers has plenty of war fights with weapons so strong and powerful. Again, this story seemed to have been written by a man who had seen it all. The Two Towers is unforgettable, flawless, and imaginative. This movie, I cannot forget even if I tried. The Two Towers again lifts me into another dimension.

		<fullReview>In fact, this is a better film then fellowship. Slightly better structured, story-wise, the film has a better pace then it's predecessor, with greater challenges facing our heroes, now split into 3 groups. The frantic last 15 minutes are amazingly well done, and the film is littered with visual delights, such as Gollum, Treebeard and, briefly, the Oliphaunt. Acting is up a notch on the first part, probably largely due to additions of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. The rousing score is put to even better use here, the final battle at the end, with the ladders, deserving special mention. Cinematography is again sensational. A significantly worthy addition to the series, in which the special effects, oddly far superior to part one, are worthy of recoginition (unlike say, something along the lines of The FAKEtrix Reloaded). 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fellowship has been broken. Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun...The above is the plot in a nutshell. This 3-hour (3.7 for the Extended version) movie has gone beyond the imaginable. Trees that talk and pick up humans, to this Gollum character who's downright annoying. What is in store for the Return of the King?Don't misunderstand me, I liked the film, and after seeing the original I was anxious to see this one, as I had heard that it would be coming out in the upcoming months. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. well that would be a like. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but it was way too long. I will definitely see Return of the King in the theater next year but SOMEONE TELL PETER JACKSON TO INCLUDE AN INTERMISSION!While the movie is very visually impressive, I believe that the film is not up to the hype that it was given. I should have known however that it was LOTR worshipers who gave it 26269 ratings of 10. Did it disserve a best picture award? It absolutely did not. I was glad that it got the special effects Oscar, however. But nonetheless, I was able to hold my urine for to hours, for I was intrigued to find out what happened in the end.The Battle of Helms Deep was probably one of the best battle scenes done since Braveheart and I thought it was an excellent adaptation of Tokien. However, it lingered for too long. I think Tokien would have liked these movies, but disliked at how bored you sometimes you get sitting in the chair.This movie was very good. However, the American Film Institute need not revise its 100 greatest movies of all time for Fellowship or Two Towers. Like many series films, I thought that the first film, The Fellowship, was far superior.MPAA Rating: PG 13My Rating: 12 and up for epic battle sequences and scary imagesMy * Rating 8.8</fullReview>

Even when the likes of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin look like faultering the direction alone solves the problem. ...The weak part of the films IN MY OPINION involved Elijah Wood and that boring but needed scene involving Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving. ...All in all the reason this film is so damn good is because of that amazing Helms Deep battle... which was 10 out of 10 as far as battle sequences go!

It's only too bad Peter Jackson will be snubbed by the Academy's disdain for scifi/fantasy in lieu of socialist dogma. The acting was simply wonderful, with Wood, Astin, Mortensen, McKellan, etc. surpassing anything in the history of scifi/fantasy! I can't wait for the third installment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic middle chapter of the LOTR trilogy. Peter Jackson again showed his talent in directing this film. After I saw the Fellowship of the Ring, I didn't know how anything could follow up such a great movie, but the Two Towers managed to do so perfectly.The Two Towers smoothly changed scenes from Frodo, Sam, and Gollum making their way to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf in Rohan and Helm's Deep, and Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard in Fangorn Forest. The elements of the film were excellent.The actors did wonderful jobs portraying their characters, especially Elijah Wood (Frodo), Sean Astin (Sam), Andy Serkis as Gollum, Ian Mckellen (Gandalf), and Viggo Mortenen (Aragorn). Elijah Wood had to portray a different attitude for Frodo than in the first, and he did this well. The actors all worked well together as an ensemble.The music throughout the film fit the scenes perfectly, and the visual effects of the film were also very well done. The battle of Helms Deep was a very breath-taking part, and King Theoden's transformation was also impressive. Another extremely impressive element of the film was Gollum. Gollum was very believable as a CGI and added to the movie's greatness.Although the Two Towers was a very dramatic movie, it mixed some comic relief in as well. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates great films.</fullReview>

But there seemed to be a lack of coheshion in the movie and any thrust. I was looking at my watch for the film to be over during the final 1/2 hour. But the second one was totally awesome. Very few sequels surpass their originals, and this was one of them. The final war was the cream of the special effects. "My Precious" favourite.

		<shortDescription>Amazing! The movie for all Tolkien-fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I looked up from the paper one day and realised that the greatest fantasy epic of all time was being made into a movie, I could do nothing but stare at the picture with my mouth wide open.For Tolkien's epic "The Lord of the Rings" was indeed being made into a motion picture, separated into the three movies "The Fellowship of the Ring," "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King." A year ago, I saw the first film, and I was intrigued. Peter Jackson, director, did a wonderful job of turning the book into a movie. (Though I was a bit disappointed that he left out Tom Bombadil.) But I'm not here to talk about "The Fellowship of the Ring" - I'm here to talk about "The Two Towers," the most amazing movie that I've probably ever laid eyes upon.It started out with a flashback to the "Fellowship," and I was thinking, "All right. I know this happens...Can we move on to that sexy Elijah Wood [Frodo] now?" But within a short fifteen seconds or so, I had forgotten about the male leads in the movie and I was biting my nails for Gandalf as he fell down the Mines of Moria clutching on to the monstrous Balrog. From then on, my eyes were glued to the screen as I watched the adventurous Hobbits trek through the lands of Middle-earth as their never-ending quest for the Ring continued.In "The Two Towers," the realm of Rohan is introduced, and this makes things a whole lot more interesting. The action is extraordinary. For the first time, the real world of Men is introduced rather than the first movie's hiding within the sacredness of the Wood-elves and the sleepy Hobbits. There's literally tons of war scenes that'll make your blood run cold. Peter Jackson definitely did an extraordinary job with directing and creating this film, and I thank him for that.Though some Tolkien-fans might disagree with me when I say that this is the perfect movie, and that it's not as true to the books, I really have to say that they should let things slide a bit. This is more true than Harry Potter is to its books. (And a whole lot better, if you ask me...) If you were a true Tolkien-fan you wouldn't care if it sucked, you'd care if they did everything in a way that the filmmakers actually put time into it - and they did - TWO YEARS of time!Overall, I'd have to say that if I could see this movie again before it hits DVD, I definitely would, and I'd like to thank Elijah, Viggo, Ian, Andy, Dom, Billy, Orlando, John and Sean for your great roles in the movie!-Ravenn Porter (MissyBaggins91)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The all male 'Mardi Gra' of the Ring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ya know when I was 11, I was beaten senseless on a regular basis. Bullied beyond belief! Granted there were mitigating circumstances that lead to my brutalization at the hands of young sadists. I had 'uncool' clothes with patches so big and colorful that I looked like a circus performer. I also only showered if I was forced to and spent most of my days covered in mud. My tastes also haunted me. I loved jet fighters, fantasy novels and dungeons and dragons. People like me know that only one thing can come from LOTR, social exclusion. So its funny, have you noticed how geek-dum is coming to Hollywood? Quite possibly you have. In fact they have taken William Randolph Hearst's place as the chief inhalers of cocaine and the grand administrators of all Hollywood orgies. Remember 'Eyes Wide Shut?' Those were all comic book and fantasy freaks! Did you notice the masks and the role playing? Kubrick was actually exposing these people! Whats even freakier is that the marketing exec's are right there with them, chanting. This is because these films have so many marketable goods.I could have easily hated this film. Anything with Elves and trees that walk and talk is deserving of contempt. Tolkiens novel is also known for its asexuality and repressed homosexuality. How very English! Yet somehow this film works, like Fellowship did. Yes the characters are very cheesy. The viewer does wonder what Sam and Frodo are doing in the bushes when the camera is not on them, perhaps a secret wedding? There was one in Attack of the Clones! Also Aragorn is such a cardboard cut out of a 'hero' that he belongs in the same Parthenon of hero's as Mr T and Shatners infamous Captain Kirk. Aragorn and Legolas, Sam and Frodo. So many cute couples. Lords of each others rings. Thats why I think they threw in some love interests because otherwise...this isn't a fellowship of the ring but a Mardi Gra of the ring. Many people I talk to complain about the issues of lack of depth in the characters. However as I have said, I don't think it is Jacksons fault. I think these flaws go back to the original text. But hey, 'cocktails anybody?'The feminine angle of the film further bugs me when none of the women engage in physical combat! They are forced to look after the kids! Isn't this the 21st century!?! Where the hell was Xena!?! She would have kicked ass! I mean I can't remember the book very well, but didn't women fight? Listen, if you are heavily outnumbered against a bunch of very hungry looking Urak Hai, you would have your wife, daughters and grandmother fighting with pitchforks! The character Eowyn should have had more to kick. She was straight jacketed by the limited role and wasn't let out to kick ass and chew bubble gum! Everyone wants to see sexy chicks kicking ass or mud wrestling.Basically what Jackson has done is take the best elements of the book and made them cool. Observe Legolas using a shield as a skateboard at the battle of Helms Deep. Jackson has 'Matrixed' LOTR. I am sure if Tolkien saw this, he would roll in his grave, either that or spark up a big fat one. The battle scenes are impressive and they made me think that they must have been extraordinarily difficult to film. Tension is actually built up all through the film and by the time Helms Deep rolls around the viewer is at the edge of their seat. Well at least I was! So many aspects of this film could have been so very cheesy. The Ents could have destroyed the whole film. The Golem could have been the worst thing to hit cinemas since Jar Jar Binks or that guy who played Anakin in Clones...The villains are also well done. They look like the evil dead and speak like Sid Vicious. Orcs and Goblins as punks is a cool idea and harks back to Jacksons classic 'Meet the Feebles.' Also an added bonus is that many stars of a local kiwi soap die in this film. To see 'Lionel' and that other guy die is worth the price of admission alone!The set designs, costumes and special effects are all excellent. The filmakers deserve an oscar for those aspects. Golem becomes the first computer generated psycho, who is actually well acted and could give Anthony Perkins a run for his money. WETA obviously went nuts on this movie. The effects literally transport you to another world. I was amazed as Jackson has taken the images of the book and what I imagined and transposed them onto the screen. This is how Tolkiens invented world looks and is! For achieving this feat alone the Jackson team deserve much credit. This film is also a great tourist brochure for New Zealand and hopefully many d&amp;d freaks will come here and pretend to be little goblins in the Mines of Moria.Overall this is a simple film. But it is still a very enjoyable one. The last two points I would like to mention are,1. Why do Christians watch LOTR and boycott Harry Potter? Two Towers has brutal violence and homicidal maniacs that make Josef Stalin look like Timothy Leary! Potter gets picketed and banned in school libraries! Just because Tolkien is Christian and Potter is not devout, that does not mean Potter is an evil little boy who deflowers virgins. That's not Potter, that's Bill Gates. 2. Why did anyone think any of these films would get Oscars? Other than for special effects. It has Hobbits in it! Did anyone notice that? How can anyone take this film seriously? Although Chicago won oscars and it possessed a singing Richard Gere. Jesus, there is hope for ROTK then.I give this film 7 extremely horny and angry Urak Hais out of 10. Thats a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much different than the book I remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see a film which is based on a novel, or anything else for that matter, you must understand what you are seeing is the Director's version of the book; they're image in which the book gave them. Therefore, this is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, not Tolkiens. Whether or not Tolkien would have like this would be up for arguement. But Jackson makes a lot of assumptions and conclusions on the history of Middle-earth and weaves his movie around that instead of drwaing what is told directly from the book. For example, Aragorn and Arwin, with one of them falling off the cliff. This is not mentioned in the book, but is an assumption which Jackson has made. While this film does great to draw in action fans and war fans, and does well with great shakespearian style acting, (those are its high points), it fails at portraying the book from my point of view. Though he does well at portraying the competitive friendship of Gimli and Lagolas, he steals away from the portrayel of orcs as horrid and powerful beings. He does not do well at balancing the two. He also misses out on a lot of the imagery the book conveys. But if you haven't read the book, these things won't stop you from enjoying a pretty good movie. It's much better and much more entertaining than the first movie he did.</fullReview>

I am not a fan of role plays, I have not read the books but I have seen Part 1, The Fellowship of the Ring, and I thought it was a good movie. The tricks and the atmosphere were great, but there the plot was also confusing. Perhaps you can't always make a perfect movie out of a book. In this case you need to make sense of so many things at once that it can be quite demanding. I simply don't care enough to learn about the seemingly limitless worlds in which the manifold characters live. Elves, gnomes, fairies, who can keep up with them? I like complexity but not in a fantasy world, but I don't remember when I have seen that on a screen. Moreover, a movie is for entertainment and I was only amazed at the quality of this second part so I could not even begin to grasp the highly confusing story!

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I like this movie, it was engrossing and entertaining.There was one big problem I had with it however...(Spoilers)The combat scenes are too arcadish for my taste. "My score will be higher than yours!" or something to that effect was actually said by Gimli at one point during the battle for Helms Deep. I realize this is somewhat true to the book, that the protagonists killed many orcs, but there was no real sense of danger. Legolas sliding down the stairs on the shield while machine gunning with his bow, then rocketing the shield into another orc defies belief. The Uruk-Hai acted more like bowling pins than heavily armored, savage warriors. When you're going to base half of a 3 hour movie on combat it really needs to be done well, and I don't think this was.I also predict slower sales for the final movie of the trilogy. Despite characters in the movie assuring us there's a lot left to do, I think it's pretty obvious that The Return of the King will be a mop up operation.That being said I'm still looking forward to it.Rating - 8.2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think I'm starting to come around on this series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me six months before finally seeing the second installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of the Rings. I saw the first right around the time of its release. I was one of the few who just didn't get it. Coupled with how bored I was with the first Harry Potter movie, I came to the conclusion that I was never meant to be into straight fantasy. I'm about the only one of my friends who does not get excited about Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Magic: The Gathering. Nor have I ever read Tolkien's books.So Two Towers finally showed up at the dollar cinema (actually a buck fifty). With all of the hooha surrounding these films I figured at some point I would have to see it anyway. It's cheaper than renting it from Blockbuster AND I'm seeing it on the big screen.I actually enjoyed this one for the most part. It occurred to me that the problem I had with Fellowship of the Ring is probably the same problem that most people had with The Phantom Menace: it holds itself back a bit. It saves all its good ideas for later and lets itself simply be an introduction to a larger whole. This middle part of the trilogy finally is swept up with all of the imaginative stuff that you expect to see in this type of movie. Gollum and the big walking tree guys really sold the whole thing for me. As impressive as the Battle of Helms Deep was, I liked watching the big tree guys putting the smackdown even more. However, an observation. While most of geekdom has proclaimed the Lord of the Rings movies to be the hands-down winner as between it and the Star Wars prequels, I still stand firm on my belief that both these series are qualitatively even. The dialogue in Two Towers bears little resemblance to how real people speak or interact with one another. Most everyone speaks in succint proclamations with very little nuance. But that's okay. It's not dialogue or subtle character development that brings us to these movies. It's all about the imagination and epic scope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good follow-up, though it strays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers was an excellent follow-up to Fellowship. It was probably more exciting, and Helm's Deep may have been the best part of the series thus far. Also, Gollum was a delightful surprise, both CGI and otherwise. I didn't think they could make his character so real, as well as two-faced, just like he was in the book. I think it strayed from the book a bit too much though. The whole Aragorn-over-the-cliff thing wasn't necessary, nor was the Frodo-to-Osgiliath. This movie was long, but they actually cut off a large part of the ending, (Saruman-Pippin with the palantir, and Frodo w/ Shelob and Cirith Ungol), so I cant see how they will make the third movie anything under 4 hours, without cutting off large chunks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have started reading "The Fellowship of the Ring" and almost fell asleep. I doubt I will ever get to read "The Two Towers", but I can already infer that this movie is so much better than its book.It didn't have that excitement in the first movie: too much war. Violence is not something many enjoy watching, but then again there are those who do like watching it. I don't think it will disappoint anyone who has read the book.Maybe it's just me, since my "Lord of the Rings" phase has almost completely passed... but this movie is not bad. Any Lord of the Rings fan can watch this movie and be so crazy about it it will make their hair hurt. I don't know what I just said, but I think it is now time for my rating.8/10... okay sequel!</fullReview>

There is one thing I must say negative about Two Towers, THE ENTS.....they are very fake looking, and the hobbits when treebeard is holding them look so computer generated. Other then that, the movie rocks!!! Once again Peter, you did it!

In the first one there was narrator telling the basics in the beginning, then there was the present time without a narrator etc. The two towers is already fully in the story and the events go on on their own time. Although there were lots of struggles, it was not frightening or boring. Smeagol is so cute and it was nice to see more of him and hear about his life. Great!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific in so many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers was a great movie to me. It had everything in it. It had the forbidden love, action, gore (mild orc blood, not extreme that I remember), sadness, bravery, and hope. In this film of the trilogy, it shows that there is a definite hope that the ring will be destroyed. Terrifying Uruk-Hai are marching to Helm's Deep to slaughter a city, and there aren't enough men, which means it's gonna be a long night. The movie also gives you an emotion you wouldn't have expected to have. You feel sorry for Gullum, or Smeagol. He has dark side, but then he has sweet side. But what's sad about him, is that he's almost like a child who doesn't quite know as much as the rest of world, while he's fighting off the darker side of him who he can't seem to rid himself of. If you like fantasy movies with adventure in them, than there is a very good chance that you'll love "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, many others have commented on the superb job that is being done by Peter Jackson and the New Line team adapting Tolkien's books for the screen, so my few words won't add much. This is the best film I have ever seen, the only film I have ever paid three times to see in the cinema and I am sure will become my second favourite film after the Return of the King comes out in December.A few things to justify my opinion:Gollum - the best realised computer generated character in the history of film. Should have won an oscar. The scores - one of the best film scores I have ever heard (and the only one I have ever bought). Should have won an oscar. Vigo Mortensson as Aragorn - better than in the book (where he is a prig and keeps on holding up the action with silly songs). Should have won an oscar. Attention to detail - when the rain starts as the huge army descends on Helm's Deep, you can hear the drops pinging off the armour.</fullReview>

But never mind! Oh and Andy Serkis was good but DID NOT deserve an academy award and the stuff not in the book the film makers added were pointless! ... I love this film but I am not going to lie and say this film was flawless! ... Mortensen, Bloom &amp; Davies are the best things about this movie.

		<shortDescription>Good film, but the first was better (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers (2002) You all know the cast! **** I might as well get it out of the way - I am a purist so this review will be pretty critical. I'll start with the negatives however, so that I can finish the review with the praise this film deserves. I will also skip most of the plot detail, because I am fairly sure that most of you know the storyline.At first viewing, the pacing of TTT might seem a little jerky, as we shift between the various plotlines. One of the problems noted almost instantly is a lack of scale, mainly in Frodo and Sam's story. The Dead Marshes appear too small so that Mordor, instead of being a distant blur on the horizon is constantly close and threatening, the red light of Mount Doom always showing. You lose the epic scale from the book. This shows again when after Helm's Deep, Gandalf and others ride to the top of the ridge. Mordor is strangely close again.Minor changes like sending the women and children to Helm's Deep will have repurcussions in ROTK which I will not detail because they are spoilers.Cutting off the end of the book is not a particularly good idea because ROTK is going to be packed with action anyway. Faramir's personality change was one of the things that got me most. Instead of appering as a complete contrast to Boromir, as a true Numenorian who would not pick up the Ring if it were lying by the wayside, he appears even darker than Boromir.Osgiliath, seemingly served no more purpose than to inform us that Peter Jackson can do amazing things with computers. Well - we already knew that! Osgiliath looked perfect. But taking Frodo and Sam there not only removed the sense of urgency, it diminished the scale even further. Then there was the fact that Frodo and Sam are supposed to know absolutely nothing about the outside world.Another point that was mentioned - in Osgiliath, Faramir screams, 'Nazgul!'. No one knew who the creatures on wings were until right at the end. The Black Breath etc is referenced, but the characters do not know that the Nazgul are what is spreading terror. The Fell Beasts were not threatening enough I felt.The Wargs were absolutely pointless and showed the one weakness in the Special Effects. And Aragorn's near death? Death has been faked so many times in this trilogy that it is ridiculous and unbelievable when it occurs and is actually in the book. A few odd things - the Ents' faces were very good, but the rest of them was not substantial enough and Gandalf's reintroduction (to Merry and Pippin), I disliked intensely. Also, Rohan was not the flat green grasslands that it should have been.The only cast member I disliked? Elrond who seems far too severe! As he is half man, he would not be so harsh on men. Finally - the Great Eye of Sauron. It just didn't fit. Dare I say it, it reminded me of the power coupling in Episode 2, just a different colour!Enough of bad points, although there were more, I'll move on to the (many) positives!The cast - well what can I say? New and established members alike, I was wowed.Sets - especially Edoras. Exactly as I had pictured them in my own imagination. Fangorn was absolutely perfect, as was Helm's Deep. The Black Gate has got to be one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.Special Effects - especially Gollum. I have never seen such a brilliant CG character. His split personality was perfect too. I felt sorry for him, I hated him, I loved him!The battle sequences were brilliant. Helm's Deep did not seem too long and who can forget the trail of the Orc armies stretched across the plain?The destruction of Isengard, the breaking of its dam, I was awed. The tiniest detail was observed. Just look at the detail on the Elven brooches, on armour, the pillars of Meduseld.And a small thing that I would like to say is thank you to Peter Jackson and his team for their research on pronuciation. If I had had to sit through FOTR with everyone saying Sawron, I would not have gone to see TTT.And I really liked the foreshadowing of Aragorn's death. It was incredibly moving, although it did not state that Arwen loses her immortality and dies shortly afterwards, which would have been another moving touch.Enough from me rambling on! I am not going to review FOTR as well, because I have so much to say. From this review, you might deduce that I dislike TTT because I fear my complaints exceed my praises. I just tend to notice my dislikes more and voice them! It cannot be said I disliked this film - I've seen it 3 times and will certainly go again. I did however, prefer FOTR. That is on of the reasons why I have given this film 4 stars and not the 5 I would give to Fellowship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "The Two Towers" has got some scenes that are absolutely fantastic - breathtaking (e.g. the arrival of the four heroes at Edoras, the destruction of Isengard, Gollum's monologues etc...) and some very ugly commercialised scenes that only appeal to Americans (e.g. Aragorn's and Arwen's kiss, Gimli's bad jokes and Legolas' skate). New Line must understand that the film is not only out in America but also in Europe and other countries, where the audience are demanding films of greater quality.However, this does not mean that The Two Towers is a bad movie. In fact, it's one of the best movies ever made!!! Everything in this film is brilliant: especially the perfomances, which are outstanding! And so are the costumes, the music, the cinematography and everything else in this movie...!Recommended to everyone, except those who do not like fantasy. 9,5/10</fullReview>

I thought it was truly a classic to be treasured forever. But what about this one?Well, the first thing I could put it when I came out of the theaters was... disappointed.Unlike the first one, which just seemed to move fast and never let you down, this one drags on at parts. But don't be too discouraged by this review. I only said I was disappointed. I never said I hated this movie. Far from it.For one thing, like everybody else, I enjoyed the battle of Helm's Deep. For those of you who missed it in Ralph Bakshi's version (a heavily underrated and misunderstood work of artistic innovation), it's right here, and it couldn't be even better. Through the disappointment of the first two hours of the film, I was hoping to get something redeeming and change my mind. Well, I found it. Helm's Deep absorbs you into the action just like all the action in the first installment did.Hopefully, The Return of the King will be a lot better.Review: **1/2 (8/10, somewhat disappointed, but don't miss it); Rated: USA PG-13 UK 12A Canada 14A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The road goes ever on and on....And brings us in the human territories of middle earth. The images are great, the music a masterpiece at certain points. Peter Jackson's craftmanship obvious all over the project. But...?This movie exists only to testify that "Fellowship of the Ring" was indeed a great movie.I left the theatre with mixed feelings. I didn't know if I liked it or not. What did i see? what did it say to me? Well, the movie actually differs a lot from the book. But I'm ok with that. There are huge differences as to what works in a reader's fantasy, and what works cinematically.But...? It looked rough. It looked like someone yelled "ok, let's get done with it" while filming. It looked disconnected.This movie's actual intention, is to introduce us to the characters of Gollum and Faramir, because they have each a special part to play in act three, "The Return of the King". At a certain point you think that this could be accomplished by merging elements from the "two towers" in the "Return of the King".Maybe though all this is because it originally was about an hour and a half longer and the producers at new line decided that Peter Jackson is nuts and cut it down to the core. I definatelly wait the Extended DVD Edition, with high hopes bestowed on Peter Jackson (who has never failed me before), and proving that the guys in the studio offices actually are wrong from time to time...Woa! I almost forgot! My God! The Gollum effect is the most unbelievable CGI character that has ever existed on screen. The interaction with the human characters was breathtaking. Serkis' acting (body language) unbeatable. WETA Digital, diserves all oscars they can have. And it should put the fathers of the SFX, LucasFilm's ILM in serious thinking as to where are THEY going?we only have to wait and see, while the road goes ever on and on....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another comment on how good it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still cannot decide which of the two lotr films i prefer, but I don't really think that matters, as I rate them both 10/10. The thing I loved about The Two Towers was that straight off we were back where we had left off - it felt like there was no time between me seeing this and the first one in the cinema. Some say TTT has a lack of characterisation, but I felt you really began to see the individual traits, as the fellowship has scattered. Viggo Mortensen dons the reluctant hero so easily as Aragorn, he is a brilliant actor and deserves to get the recognition he deserves - even if he doesn't want all the Hollywood attention. Elijah Wood continues his great portrayal of Frodo, and Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are just as good as in the previous one. Some parts were cheesy (like Sam's little overview at the end), but even though this was a long film, I wanted it to go on. How this differs from other films is that I feel as if I am there and living the troubles, and joys that the characters experience, rather than watching - my heart was beating so fast during the battle. The highlight is always going to be seen as the battle of Helm's Deep, and it has been criticised that it revolves around it too much, but I think the anticipation build up is great. I loved the whole thing, minor criticism was the Ents weren't great when viewed close up, but I'm knit-picking! I better stop blabbing, and just finish: I am counting the days to the finale of this awesome trilogy. I just hope it does not get so hyped up that it disappoints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've read the hobbit &amp; LotR more than twice, and i liked both of the LotR films--the second a few degrees less. both films needed someone to proofread the scripts; i'll elaborate on this point in a bit.spoilers:even though the battle @ helm's deep was unnecessarily long, it was rather spectacular. however, the warg battle, the dwarf jokes, and the false death of viggogorn were entirely unnecessary and drained the script-writing energy out of more deserving parts of the story. yeah, yeah, i know and even respect the notion that cinema is a different medium from the literary, but what if jackson's FotR had spent an hour in the realm of tom bombadil and tossed in a new battle sequence at the shire, leaving less than two hours for the remainder of the story? whereas FotR's priorities were largely well-placed (i can't thank jackson enough for having brought this book to the screen), TTT suffered from a lack of focus. TTT's being the middle film in jackson's trilogy really doesn't explain the silly plot liberties, as some here have suggested.despite my delight at gollum's overall depiction, i did find his modern psychoanalytic utterings a bit out of place. the ents were somewhat more disney-animatronic than i'd imagined, but this is a minor gripe.despite my criticisms, i was able to enjoy TTT to a fair degree; i just won't watch it over and over again the way i did FotR, unless the extended DVD release is particularly strong.what really bugged me about the films, however, was the jacked usage and grammar. to each his own peeves, i guess, but these goofs really jarred me out of middle earth more than any dwarf-tossing joke.FotR: elrond says, 'blah blah blah from whence it came.' whence is an odd bird of a word, combining both a preposition and a subordinating conjunction--it means 'from where.' thus, 'from whence'='from from where.' bahh!TTT: theoden says something like, 'no parent should have to bury their child.' that was a nasty pronoun-antecedent mismatch; no king should have to speak so poorly! (though an american president with a third-grade vocabulary often gets away with worse.) 'parent' is singular; 'their' is not.heck, i'd proofread the scripts free of charge if mr. jackson would let me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was such thing as a sequal being better than the first one, than this is it! The Two Towers are full of everything a movie needs: action, romance,suspence, and even some comedy. Peter Jackson has totally brought Middle Earth to life as he introduces us to new characters, such as Eowyn, and re-aquaint ourselves with others, such as Gollum. We also go where no one has gone before, like Rohan, and deep into Mordor. You don't even have to read the book in order to understand what is going on. It would keep you on the edge of your seat.However, if you actually read the book, there were a couple of things that every movie based on books has. It doesn't have every detail that was described in the book. Although it has happened before, and most likely will happen again, you just can't get over it. However, we can only hope that whatever is missing in this movie will pop up in the next one. Until then, I think everyone should see the movie, and I rate it a 9.5/10!!</fullReview>

One of the reasons why some parts were left out of TTT is because they couldn't make the movie too long, so the scenes left out will more than likely be in the third movie.So I really think that you people with no sense of good movies need to just chill out and take some time to actually think about the decisions that Peter Jackson made about HIS MOVIE.

		<shortDescription>Concerning Towers, Dreams and other stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading a readers letter in some film publication around Christmas time, where the question of which two towers the title was referring to, was brought up. The answer the publication gave, in which they quoted a letter from Tolkien to his publisher, was Orthanc and Cirith Ungol. They went on to write that, since the Ringbearers arrival at Cirith Ungol is delayed to the third film, the Two Towers in the film are Orthanc and Barad-dur. Which makes more sense to me, because that is where Saruman and Sauron "live". As for the film, I think it is one of the best ever, and one where they actually made CGI moving. The scene where Treebeard sees the destruction of the forest near Isengard, and the Ents heading for Isengard really got to me. Move over, Greenpeace! I was disappointed, though, by that they didn´t include Faramir´s vision/dream of seeing Boromir dead, and later finding the broken Horn of Gondor washed ashore. If they had included this, some more light could have been shed on the character of Faramir, he was a bit too one-note for me.I mean, at least Boromir smiled a few times during FotR, but Faramir doesn´t here, well, not before he is tempted by the Ring, anyway. Not that I blame him, after all, he is the non-favourite son of the Steward of Gondor, he knows his brother is dead, but that doesn´t make him more favoured, and his country is about to be attacked by a huge army from Mordor. The dream-sequense would only have taken about a minute or so of screen time, anyway, and I know which scenes they could have cut down on, but I won´t name names. Interesting dialogue, though: Go to sleep/This is a dream etc., because the lucky members of the audience are asleep/dreaming, while those who are too eager to catch up with the movie when it "re-starts", are awake and presumably in pain. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, but still flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers Herein*There seems to be a fundamental division between those who see this film. Everyone either says decisively that they much preferred the previous one or they much preferred this one. Personally, I preferred this one. The ending is much better than film one, and the new characters (Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Gollum, Treebeard, Faramir and Wormtongue) make it much more interesting. However, I'm not sure all the changes to the book worked.Let's start with the good changes. I think having Wormtongue banish Eomer at the start, only for him to return with Gandalf to save the day at the battle of Helm's Deep was a very good idea, and I think it makes him a more memorable character for those who haven't read the book (I've read it twice by the way).The platoon of Elves arriving at Helm's Deep, and the death of Haldir was also a good idea, as I think people might be disappointed if Haldir had just faded after the first film, as he did in the books.Faramir taking Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath wasn't a particularly good idea, but I can understand why Peter Jackson did it. At this point, the battle of Helm's Deep was at its climax and the Ents were wrecking Isengard. I think Jackson wanted to put in a third action sequence (ie. the Ringwraith attack) as if it had just shown Frodo and Sam walking along with Gollum it would have looked pretty silly.Onto the bad changes now. Just what was the Warg attack all about? And even worse, Aragorn falling off the cliff? That scene belongs in Monty Python, not Lord of the Rings. People have said that Aragorn's fall was so that he could see the Uruk-hai army, but surely Theoden could just have sent a scout or something?And of course, the most discussed flaw in the film itself: Legolas using the shield as a skateboard. Everyone mentions this, and no wonder. It completely undermines the serious implications of the battle, and simply isn't funny.I also felt that the dialogue in this film wasn't quite as good as in Fellowship. Gimli boasting about his running ability was mildly amusing, but it was out of place. However, Theoden's poem (Where is the horse and the rider/ where is the horn that was blowing...) worked very well, and to be honest I quite liked Sam's speech at the end.Generally, the acting was perfectly fine, particularly from Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Brad Dourif, and Bernard Hill. Jackson's inventiveness with the camera is inspired and I know he will make a fantastic film out of The Return of the King.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TWIN TOWERING TRUIMPHANT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been the best film I ever saw. I saw this movie 3 times in the theatre. The costume design in that movie was so well done. There was 30 to 60 minutes of action plus 100 minutes of excellent drama and plot to keep you at your seats. The acting was good as it can be. Even the Worst actress/actor Liv Tyler was great. Liv Tyler is a beautiful actress when it comes to movies. Her birthday is on Canada Day. This movie reminded me of Warcraft and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. If you play Warcraft and love D &amp; D then this is the one film. This is the orignial fantasy written storyline ever. It first came it to stores in 1954(not to mention Canada's first subway line to open in Toronto, Ont). This is one of the rare and few films that deserve to be in the top ten films of all time if not 25. I can't wait till they release the director's cut version that has 30-35 minutes of extra scenes with make the movie more Tolkien based rather than RPG based. In the Director's cut I hope they put in longer battle scenes just like what they did in the first one. I will recommend this movie to people who are ages 10 and above to all boys and girls. Gamers will reconize Brad Dourif as Wormtongue because he was in Myst III: Exile. It is better than even Terminator and Harry Potter because it is. This is movie cannot get any better than this 10/10 Maybe 11/10 for Director's Cut</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just thought I'd drop you a few lines to let you know we're back from our vacation. This year, we went to Middle Earth. Spent two wonderful days with a remarkable tour guide, a gentleman named Peter Jackson. He's well-versed in the lore of the region, and never once bored us with his take on things Tolkein. We traversed terrain the likes of which we never imagined existed. The locals were a colorful lot, and quite unforgettable- in particular, a fellow mostly skin and bones who went about on all fours and wore nothing more than a wash-rag loincloth. (I daresay the chap wasn't quite all there, as he was often overheard conversing with himself.) The countryside literally came alive for us as we travelled. Reminded me somewhat of our trip to Oz.Well, I must be off. Here's hoping you're the same.</fullReview>

"The Two Towers" just stands for the two and their alliance. :o) Also, you had said that it was a pity the Fellowship did not unite. I think, in your case, reading the books would help understand what Tolkien was trying to get across to his readers. Frodo is destroyed by the corruption of the ring, Boromir is dead, and Gandalf is a completely different person. It's part of the drama, beauty, and charm of "The Lord of the Rings". Besides, at the end of "The Return of the King," there won't be any need for a Fellowship of the Ring. :op</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, TTT is the middle episode of a trilogy, and by the end of it the characters are not much closer to the completion of the quest... but man, this is how fantasy is supposed to be done. And Gollum - I still get goose bumps when I hear his sad song over the end credits. Has there ever been a more brilliantly realised non-human character? Rubbish like Harry Potter's Nobby just serves to show how brilliant Gollum is. The same dialogue, both brilliantly funny and utterly tragic. One of my all-time favourite characters, which isn't bad for a vicious little traitor.*SPOILER* One question - why on earth doesn't Frodo explain to Gollum why he had to "trick" him? He has to know that Gollum will have felt betrayed, and that Gollum's "conversion" was reasonably tenuous to start with. I can't believe that Frodo does that to Gollum without explanation and then blithely trusts Gollum not to do something vicious in return. For someone who understood Gollum so well throughout the film, this sudden lapse of insight is a bit strange...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i read the first book before i saw the film last year, and was dissapointed with "the fellowship of the ring" on first viewing. Then on second viewing, i found it very good, and on third viewing i became a lover of the film. I started to read the second book but like a lot of people who have tried to read them, only managed to get half way through. The book became too hard to read, with tolkien becoming more and more descriptive, and beatifully poetic, but taking an awful long time to get the story going. So i stopped reading it.Now, the film is out. And i hoped i wouldn't lose interest at the similair point in the film. Luckily i didn't. Peter Jackson intertwines each of the three different storylines well, one of which becomes a little too less focused on. And the film does take a while to gather some steam. But when it does it is damn well worth it. Yes, some of the effects are a little "crap" for lack of a better word. Well too be fair, only one little negative to the effects, and you'll all see it when you watch the film. And it's not gollum either. And also a scene that is unintentionally funny, which maybe us brits will only gringe at. Anyway, Gollum enters the scene, and i did groan and think oh no, it looks too fake. But after a short while, when it closes in on his character, he does look fantastic. And at times, very very funny and very very evil. And everyone is saying blah blah helms deep battle, best thing you'll ever see blah blah. It isn't the best thing you will ever see, by no means, but it is absolutely fanbloodytastic. More in the mood and the build, with the rain and the distant footsteps of the approaching army. And that is only one of three brilliantly depicted battles. All the performances are good, nothing oscar worthy, and if orlando bloom gets another nomination, i'll be so damn angry. He didn't do anything in the first film, yet "best newcomer", why?. Anyway, he was good, but so was everybody else. Overall, just another great part to a film that can only truly be judged when all three are on dvd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally well made movie - But somewhat ruined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" is an exceptionally well made movie, acting, special effects and music are all at the top notch. It is probably the movie I've enjoyed watching 2003. (Yes, it I know it was released during 2002, but I always wait until there is possible to get a good seat in the theaters, and leave the camping outside the movie theaters to the geeks! ;-)) The scenery was stunning, as was the visualizations of the characters in the books, as well as the atmosphere.Unfortunately, I'm not by far as satisfied by the way Peter Jackson converted the plot of the book into a movie. There are a few changes that was made, although not all of them were bad, many of them somewhat ruined the story. Mostly these "bad" changes consists of scenes invented by mr Jackson himself, that have nothing to do with the plot, and was shown at the expense of some, more imporant scenes that had to be left out. As for example, the warg riders that assault the people of Rohan on their way to Helms Deep is quite out of line. I just can't figure out, did Peter Jackson wake up one morning, realizing that he thought it would be really cool to put orcs on big wolfs, and put them in a movie they didn't belong to? As those who have read the books probably know, there were no warg riders in the Lord of the Rings saga. The battle of Helms Deep were stretched from just a minor happening in the book, to the focal point of this entire movie. Quite naturally, a lot of scenes had to be left out then. And what is this with Osgiliath, were Frodo and Sam were brought? In the books, this was just the remnants of a former city, that had been abandoned when the forces of Mordor started to push against the people of Gondor. This meant that all references to Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith were left out of the movie, probably because of the lack of time or money, probably both. Thus, the audience missed the entire core of the story, as for exampe why it is named "The Two Towers" - Those are the citadels of Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul, towers that represent goodness and evil. Yes, that is correct, the name of this book doesn't refer to Barad-Dur and Orthanc. All these ways of showing Arwen is another way of wasting precious time; She shouldn't appear at all in TTT.Another set of bad changes - Characters. Peter Jackson have by reasons unknown decided that the craracters in the book were to be changed. The most anoying to me is Gimli, who by mr Jacksons interpretation is supposed to be a kind of fool that we should all laugh at. Yes, he's short. And can't se over the battlements of a normal fortress. He is clumsy and crude beyond belief. All he lives for is drinking beer (subsequently burping, even in the presence of a king) and fighting. Well, as described by Tolkien, Gimli is one of the more majestic and adorable characters of the entire trilogy. And quite unique for being a dwarf, because of his deep with an elf (Legolas), a race otherwise despised by the dwarves. But this is obviously not good enough for Peter Jackson. King Theoden of Rohan have been degraded from the calm, wise and understanding regent of the books, to a grumpy, somewhat incompetent and violent "don't-argue-with-me-I'm-the-king"-type of character in the movies. After being "cured" by Gandalf, his first thought was to slay Wormtongue, and Aragorn had to intervene. Well, in the book, a soldier wanted to slay Wormtongue, while Theoden intervened and instead told the guards to give him a horse and let him go. So, in essence, that is what happened in the movie, so why do all these changes? Treebeard, the wise ent, picked by curiosity up the two hobbits in the book, eager to learn more about them. By Peter Jacksons interpretation, he only wanted to kill them, because he thought they were orcs. Why was this change necessary? Besides this, the ents decided, by their own initiative, to assault Isengard according to the book, as Treebeard (a.k.a Fangorn, as he not only lived in this forrest, but he also was the soul of the forrest and knew about everything that happened in there) had grown mad with the ways of Saruman. But according to Jackson, it took the cunning of two little brats from the Shire to convince the oldest living being in Middle-Earth (Treebeard) that he should assault Isengaard. Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir, was according to Tolkien the opposite of his hot-headed and bad-tempered older brother. He was wise and calm, and choose the way of the mind instead of the way of the sword. Well, not according to Jackson. Instead, he behaves like a blueprint of his older brother, seizes the hobbits, and brings them to Gondor.I could go on forever, but I'll think I better halt here. I always expect some changes to the plot and storyline when a movie is made with a book as the foundation. Otherwise, it would probably not be possible to make something watchable. But what disturbs me about TTT is that most of these changes are totally out of line, there is no need or reason for the director of doing them! So why were these changes made? Why removing scenes that could easily have done, and replacing them with stuff that is totally out of line and that in fact does a lot of damage to the plot? Why change the characteristics and behaviour of the characters in this story, when they have already been outlined by someone who dedicated almost his entire life to create these stories?IMHO, what Peter Jackson did is unforgivable. Yes, it is a great movie and very watchable. But remember this, the author of the Lord of the Ring saga is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, not Peter Jackson or Frances Walsh. They probably don't understand that the plot of this saga is a lot more complicated than just a bunch of orcs, humans and elves that play hack'n slash with each other.Other changes that I liked is the scene were Arwen stand by Aragorns dead body in the future, and then sits by his grave for quite some time, and finally walk off into Loth-Lorien - Although the movie never explains that it is were she's heading, as well as that's were she'll die, at her own wish. I think that scene was beautiful, and quite interesting to see in this movie, since the books never states what happens to the others after the ending of the "Return of the King". And it also explains why Elrond is so hostile to the idea of his daughter marrying a simple human.This is a great movie. But make sure you watch it before you read the book if possible, otherwise you might be disappointed.</fullReview>

However, this was still a solid gold sequel and the action, drama and the excellent battle scene easily compensates the two faults I have commented about. To achieve another 10 out of 10; The Return of the King (The 3rd film) must re-unite the Fellowship and explain everything in thorough detail!!; and I mean thorough. I do declare that I rate this movie 9 out of 10 because of the two faults and the compensation of it's excellent and detailed content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now They Fight a Big Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as complex as "The Fellowship of the Rings", the middle film of the Rings trilogy should be known as the 'battle' film. At least that's how it seemed to me. "The Fellowship" laid the groundwork; introduced the main characters, the different species, and how they all interact, and now in "The Two Towers" they get down to some serious fighting. I swear the major battle at the conclusion of the movie takes up its final hour. Not that I'm complaining, but I missed the social interactions and sub-plots of "Fellowship". The highlight of "The Two Towers" is the arrival of Gollum, seen only for a brief second in "Fellowship". This CGI guy steals the movie. And I have to feel some sympathy for the hapless Orcs, whose only purpose seems to be to die horrible deaths at the hands of anything that can fog a mirror. All in all though, for medieval-style fighting (with dragons, elves, dwarfs and the like) this movie can't be beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that can be said about Peter Jackson's Two Towers by now has been said, and I'm not one for repeating the same well-earned praise. Suffice it to say that the movie delivers entirely on the expectation levels set by the first part of the trilogy, the set pieces are spectacular on a biblical scale, the cinematography is flawless and the scenery just awesomely epic. Jackson as everyone knows filmed all three parts together, which was a very bold move, but it's clear (as if it wasn't before) that both the audience and the studio's financial investments are in good hands.The Two Towers is a much darker film than the Fellowship Of The Ring, and this is deliberate, matching the growing sense of dramatic pressure and impending doom in the books. Lighting, cinematography and musical score all merge seamlessly to evoke this atmosphere, and all traces of the "cutesey" have vanished. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn comes to the fore, expanding the fierce nobility of his role with consummate skill. Ian McKellern continues to make the part of Gandalf his very own, Elijah Wood reprises his role as Frodo with the same accomplishment, and best yet, the remaining three hobbits are all fleshed out far better, given more on-screen time and thus made more three-dimensional and credible. Christopher Lee remains a superbly-cast Saruman, and the newcomers Brad Dourif as the venomously evil Grima Wormtongue and Bernard Hill as Theoden are both excellent.I have to mention how brilliantly Gollum as a character has been handled. The CGI is flawless, and Andy Serkis' realisation of the role show a scope of perceptivity and imagination that is literally jaw-dropping. The usage CGI as a whole in the movie has been executed superbly, both in terms of character and set pieces (the attack of the warg-mounted Uruk-hai, the battle of Helm's Deep etc) and I was especially interested to see how Jackson would handle the Ents, which I suspected would be the most difficult thing to do without breaking the suspension of disbelief. Needless to say, he gets away with it.A number of rabid Tolkien purists on this message board have carped about a number of chapters having been "cut" from the end of the original book - well, I'm sorry, but I just don't see the issue. The Fellowship "stole" briefly from the start of The Two Towers with the death of Boromir, because it was a more natural end-point, and The Two Towers ends with Frodo and Sam's passage to Cirith Ungol. What happens next won't be cut (and it's only two chapters) - it'll be in at the start of the next movie. You have to remember that this isn't a weekly serial - we have to wait a year for the final part - so ending The Two Towers on the same unbearable cliffhanger as the original book would not be the move of a smart director. Plus of course, the final book, The Return Of The King is much shorter. It doesn't look it on the shelf, but it's half-full of appendices and background historical information which won't be relevant to the final movie, so Jackson will have been happy to have moved the final episode into the last movie. Admittedly I don't see any real reason why Jackson should have had Faramir take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath for another albeit small set-piece (this does not occur in the book - they part company before this point), but apart from pointlessness, I have no issues with this. Maybe Jackson thought that the Ring's growing hold on Frodo needed restressing from a dramatic point of view. I'll go with his judgement on this. The same thing with the arrival of Haldor and the Elves at Helm's Deep. Not in the book, but not an issue. Maybe Jackson felt he needed to point out that the forces of Good in Middle Earth were stretched to breaking and that there no huge reserves waiting in the background.So after all this praise, why "almost perfect"? I feel almost guilty to carp after such praise but there were a few little niggles that unsettled me.Firstly, the character of Faramir. There's nothing wrong with David Wenham's acting, but the character has been radically changed. Faramir is meant to be a gentler wiser version of Boromir, not prone to unthinking rashness, but labouring under the fact that his father holds him in no value, compared to his bold foolhardy dead brother. The movie version of Faramir is far less grandiose.Then there's Eomer's Rohirrim. Where are they all? There's meant to be 2,000 of them running around, but the bunch we're shown looks like a small mounted version of some Hell's Angel chapter. Not very impressive.I'm still not happy with the way Gimli is portrayed. Yes in the books there is some comic relief provided in the banter between Gimli and Legolas, but Jackson still uses the character as not much more than a comedy dwarf. It's stereotypical and shallow - Gimli either fights or argues. There's no sense of the majesty of the dwarves, just as in movie #1 there was no evocation of Gimli's sense of loss at the fall of Moria, the culminating achievement of his people. Plus WHY OH WHY did they use John Rhys-Davies to voice Treebeard as well? It can't have been a matter of budget, and it's very obviously the same actor being used.Finally, and this I found shocking in how much it clanged, how much a single 5 second sequence totally destroyed the grandeur and the sense of the epic, how completely it shattered my sense of disbelief - Legolas, the snow-boarding elf on the shield. I cannot believe that a director with the perception and the subtlety of touch that Jackson has demonstrated ever even filmed this scene, let alone left it in the final cut. Why oh why is it there? It's self-indulgent, utterly unnecessary, completely out of place and destroys atmosphere at a single stroke. Yes I know Orlando Bloom is an extreme sports fan, but why is it necessary to leverage this and include this scene? It's a mark of how well the rest of the movie has been executed that it survives this piece of trite ludicrousness. I think Jackson really lost the plot with this incident, and it's made to stand out even more because the rest of the movie fits together so seamlessly. Peter, you're not good with comic touches, and they're not needed, so please PLEASE stop thinking you need to hammer them in.However, despite these niggles, the movie is a triumph. Roll on December 18th and The Return Of The King. A worthy 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it! No, I didn't! Yes, I liked it! No, it was bad! ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those guys who read the LOTR around once a year and who compare the movies a lot to the book. I had some issues with the script of FOTR, but the DVD version satisfied me and cleared a lot of things up. I can safely say, that part one is nearly without blemish for me.Well, TTT had even more plot holes and deviations from the book, which didn't work. However it also had some great elements, which made it more than memorable.The whole Rohan-story didn't succeed in enthralling me. The audience is thrown into it without too much explanation and I never started to care for Theodred, Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer. Some scenes and lines were quite hollow and even embarassing. All those suffering Rohan women and children didn't help either.And there are too many things left unexplained about the Ents. You never quite understand why they should go to war or why they shouldn't. Hopefully the DVD version will clear something up here.So much for the bad things, now for the good ones, and there were a lot of them: The Frodo-Sam-Gollum part worked perfectly. To view Frodo falling to the ring - great. And what can I say about Gollum, which hasn't already been said? It's the greatest CGI-character ever, by a long shot. After his introduction you have already forgotten, that he is not for real. I even liked the Faramir-character and don't think, that he is so different from the book. He has his preferences and the well-being of Sam and Frodo is not one of the first on his list.I also liked the intercut Elven scenes, even though they led to a conclusion I didn't like: The Elvish help at Helm's Deep. It's a 'feel good'-element, which should not have been necessary.At last there is one single scene, which will make this movie forever special in my mind: The charge of the Rohirrim down the hill. This is pure cinematography and potentially the most moving scene I have ever seen. The makers of the movie worked wonders with scope, lights, camera movement and the music in this part. Just remembering it gives me the shivers.The cast and the score were a notch down from FOTR, but still good. Wood and Astin got better, while I was a tad disappointed with MacKellen. Rhys-Davies was great - unfortunateley the role he was given (humorous sidekick) was not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... it looks like I'm going to have consign myself to the minority here and state that I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Not that it was actually bad, but there were some very weighty flaws that left me squirming in exasperation.Where to begin? Well, it DRAGGED - oh, how it dragged! The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it. There were pointless changes to the characterization from the novel and the effects were very variable, though the Gollum character was brilliantly realized.I left the cinema at the end feeling even more cheated than with the first installment. I'll probably buy the DVD when it's issued, in the hope that the movie flows better in that medium, as the first one did. It needs to.Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of The Rings is the greatest movie of the 21st century by anyones standards. The two towers is not a movie it is an integral part of the "big" picture. If you know your Tolkien you'll understand that The Lord of the Rings is one project and, to his eternal credit, Peter Jackson has made a fantastic effort to keep it as such and by Stretching it out over three years keeps the public interest pumped; almost begging for more of the same. This installment has the most mind blowing opening sequence that I have ever seen(perhaps this is exactly how Tolkien saw his life's work?) Peter Jackson deserves not just an Oscar for his genius, but a hell of a lot more recognition from not only his peers but from the academy. a definite 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I commented on this film a long time ago; and while I did have a few issues with some discrepancies between the book and the film (especially Faramir), one thing I never expected to be a problem for anyone was Peter Jackson's ending THIS STAGE of his overall 3-PART FILM when he did. Folks, the relationship of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers to the Return of the King is not the same as the relationship between, say, the Raiders of the Lost Ark to the Temple of Doom to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Tolkien himself only split up his saga of the Lord of the Rings into 3 books because his publisher told him it would never sell as one huge one. Peter Jackson simply split his large work a different 3 ways than Tolkien did, and I don't blame him. This movie is about 3 hours as it is (and I can only imagine the length of the Director's Cut, which by the way I hope they won't wait till November to issue this time). And while they could have cut some of the extraneous Aragorn/Arwen bits, the time they would have saved would never be enough time to do justice to what happens in the final 5 chapters of the book. Also, remember: The Return of the King is shorter by over a hundred pages, in terms of the story, than either of the first two. Peter Jackson is actually distributing the story more evenly than Tolkien did. The only "unfair" thing about what he's done, is that now the "Return" film will have all the best, scariest, and most awful bits to itself. Oh well. I can't wait for December.(P.S. By the way, I didn't see anyone complaining when Peter Jackson tacked the first half of the first chapter of the Two Towers onto the end of the Fellowship film.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all you Tolkien fans, be warned that the 2 towers is a lot less like the book than FOTR. I am one of those sad characters that reads the books on a yearly basis and having seen the film once, I need to go back and try to appreciate it in its own right. Being so well versed in the books can be a barrier to appreciating the film since all of my friends were blown away by the film. Most of them had only just read the book in preparation for the film or never read the book at all. The logical side of my brain (not outraged by some of the hefty changes to the story made by Jackson) could appreciate that it was a really powerful film, and I gradually came to see some of the reasons for the changes. However, I really do need to go back and try to see it in its own right. Golum was excellent by the way!If you are not familiar with the books - see this film and it will impress you. If you are familiar with the books - be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies. I love being enchanted by what I see on the screen without thinking about what's waiting for me outside. "The Two Towers" is the film that shocks, thrills, and afterwards stirs deepest gratitude towards all those unearthly, incredibly talented people who worked at it. This movie is pure art of film-making, and despite all the changes it's true to the book to the backbone. It is a deep flowing stream of energy, beauty and freedom; the characters, the places, the atmosphere matches exactly with what you imagined while reading the book and even more - they go far beyond the scope of your comprehension. After seeing "The Fellowship of the Ring" I thought that Tolkien spirit was displayed so completely that I simply couldn't suppose there was still room for perfection. It appeared that there was. For this movie is not only visually and emotionally gorgeous. It is REAL.</fullReview>

Sean Astin's acting is improving and Viggo was a truly underappreciated actor until now. Mr Jackson have surely done a great job on this movie. I read the books some years ago, but I read all at once, and I think Jackson delivered totally.Its obvious that some hard core fans of the book would be p***ed at the end product of this movie.

		<fullReview>This is the film adaptation of the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It follows the surviving characters from `The Fellowship of the Ring' as they continue their dangerous quest. The visual style, storyline, cinematography, acting and special effects all combine to create another milestone in filmmaking. I visited New Zealand shortly before the filming started there for the trilogy, and I actually read the novel `The Two Towers' while I was there. I could not help but project the landscapes I saw while I was there into to the book I was reading. Seeing these same landscapes now immortalized in the film version is just amazing. Some of the changes between the film and the book are quite drastic, but they should be accepted as they are two entirely different art forms that sometimes cannot be directly translated. The acting is very good, although there are many actors who have to share the three hour run time, so we only get a brief taste of many of them. The main characters are still engrossing, and the computer generated character `Gollum' is utterly convincing and realistic, almost heartbreaking at times. This film contains some of the most advanced special effects in any film, and part of their appeal is in the way they are used. Instead of blatantly using flashy effects in every scene like other directors, Jackson instead tries to use them discretely. During most of the battle scenes it seems entirely possible that we are witnessing thousands of extras, not computer generated effects, acting out the battle. Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Fellowship of the Ring' was simply remarkable. And `The Two Towers' was just as great. These two movies should be what all directors strive for, magnificent. THE TWO TOWERS does as good of a job as the first one to get the viewer really involved in the story. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole 3 ? hours approximately it was on. I haven't read either of the Lord of the Rings books so I can't say if it is better or worse than the novel. A lot of critics say that the movie left a lot of the book out of it. That's probably a good thing in a way. If the viewer read all the books, they're going to know what should happen next in the scene. I'm sure Peter Jackson knew what he was doing when he left some of the scenes of the book out of the movie. Why are the critics complaining, the movie is there to entertain you. It doesn't have to follow the book word for word. All the TWO TOWERS needs to do is keep your emotions and suspense going for the third installment of the movie. It's very hard for the audience to like a sequel better than the first one, but Peter Jackson comes extremely close. It's amazing how much special effects and detail is put into these movies. The acting is excellent; I thought Elijah Wood and Sean Astin put in a better performance than in the first one. They seemed more into their characters in the TWO TOWERS. I can't wait tell next Christmas for the prequel to come out. I'm sure there will be even greater and more exciting battles to come. These movies should be ranked beside the Godfather trilogy in being the greatest films ever made. I gave this film a 9/10 for greatness. It better win some Academy awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But it's still great. I'd like to see any other director try what Peter Jackson has done and come up with similar results. The acting is impressive, the cinematography, special effects, costuming, all amazingly done. I like the approach Jackson took with switching back and forth between the Frodo and Sam scenes and the scenes with the rest of them instead of splitting them completely like in the book.(some spoilers ahead)I do have a few beefs though. Faramir was characterized completely wrong. He was made out to be such a jerk in the film, where in the book he is a much gentler soul. That bothered me. Also, the appearance of the elves at Helm's Deep was off the book plot, though the idea seemed to work just fine. Haldir's death was uncalled for though!(end spoilers)Overall, an incredible film. Not as good as the book, but still one of the best movies I've seen. Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>human element of film good; didn't like as much as first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie in anticipation of an intense three hours. But I made a major miscalculation. I thought reading the book would make me enjoy the film more. It did not. I found myself annoyed by what Jackson did to parts of the plot. When I saw the first movie, I was emotionally sucked in because I had a space of a year between the reading of the book and the viewing of the film. This time, I viewed things with an incredibly critical eye. I didn't like what he did to Aragorn in part of the film, seeing it as unnecessary. I thought that Arwen was portrayed in an inconsistent, unjust manner. I remembered what was in the book about the battle scenes at Helm's Deep. I was immediately annoyed by Jackson's frills and the overly sentimental attachment to the roles certain characters played in the battle. I also did not quite like the way he cuts back and forth between the first half of the book and the second half. I like that he does, because it is necessary, but some skill is lacking in the methods used and the pacing, causing some parts of the film to drag and take on a dull quality. I don't like how the end of the battle at Helm's Deep is signified in the film, thinking there was better perspective and handling of it in the book.I did like the human element. I loved how Gollum, Merry, and Pippin were turned into stars. Merry and Pippin were given especially delightful roles. I loved their interaction the the ents. I loved Gollum's speeches. I love how the environmental themes Tolkein would have loved brought out were treated. I loved the simplicity with which Wormtongue's, Theoden's, and Eowyn's starting situation and relationships to each other were treated. I liked the use of monologues by certain characters. I disliked but found necessary the behind the scenes psychology of the battle of Helm's Deep. Somehow, sentimentality got hold of it too much. But I greatly admired Jackson's very human treatment of all the characters in that situation, and the way he effectively shows the attitudes of those in peril. I admired his attempt to socially and psychologically comment on what was going on. It made a lot of sense even if I didn't find all of it artistically pleasing enough.I thought some of the great strengths of the film were in the acting, monologues, and highlighting of Merry and Pippin and Gollum. I loved how Frodo is shown in relationship to Gollum and the shots used to clearly, eeerily, and humanly compare the two. The clear storytelling focus really worked for me.And as annoyed as some people are by the ending, I found it well done and a great way to wrap up the movie, make up for flaws, and really make you want to see number three.A major flaw of this movie is the forced and ineffective music, obviously intended to get you. But it didn't get me this time. It was as bad as the watered down root beer I was drinking. Another annoyance is Gollum's voice. I didn't think it was quite right.I have a reservation about the title. "The Two Towers" as a title does not hold up well thematically for the film because of the information the viewer is not given. It is better justified in the book, though still just barely. This has nothing to do with politics, but the fact that I feel it is too incompletely justified in the film and the book itself could have had a better title. I have to say this, though. The title gives nothing away.Overall, by the end, this film is a lot of fun and thought-provoking, despite my reservations. It was definitely fun for me to think about and discuss with others. I give Jackson points for pulling off anything having to do with these long novels as well as he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was a cool movie. lot's of action, and we got introduced to some new and cool characters, namely Golum, the weird newt frog man, i suppose that's what you'd call him. Golum was my favorite character in this move. it's a good thing they did all of these movies at once, or else the hype might have over shadowed the quality of the movie, but they did this a good as it could get. i also thought the tree people were really cool. they were sort of comical, but when it came time to take them seriously, surprisingly enough, you actually could take these trees seriously. it was good to see gandalf return as well. i didn't know he would cause i haven't read the book. the action scene at the end was cool, but i actually liked the parts where Golum was leading Sam and Froto though the land better, just because it showed who Golum used to be, and still partially is. The battle was pretty awesome, though.all in all i'd say this is a satisfactory follow up. i liked it just as much as the original. it's fun for kiddies and grown ups alike. this one isn't nearly as violent as everyone was making it out to be, but it's still pretty gory at parts. can't wait for return of the king to come out! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film vs. Book: A Rationalization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking over the IMDB comment board for 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers', I see that in general, it is as beloved as the first one. There is, however, a fairly large group of avid Tolkien fans who feel the removal of the ending to the book would have been unnecessary if Peter Jackson had simply cut out the Aragorn/Arwen scenes. What I hope to offer here is a rationalization as to why Jackson did what he did, and the perfectly valid justification he had for doing it. To begin with, despite many crossovers between medias of film and literature, the two rarely mix entirely. Literature is an expression of a writer's views and ideologies on the page, and film is a visual expression of the combined vision of several people. Many books are perfect fodder for adaptations, but few pieces of literature. Imagine someone trying to adapt Joyce's 'Ulysses' to the screen, or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'. It simply could not be done. In most works of great literature, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, Tolstoy, Flaubert etc., the artists express themselves through the writing as a style. Tolkien, while perhaps not on par with the supreme literary brilliance of the aformentioned authors, is still the father of fantasy, and it is his book that will be remembered as the most popular and, outside of the scholarly world, influential book of the 20th century. So how do you make it into a movie? Up until a few years ago, no one believed it could be. And then Peter Jackson released 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' last year, and everyone, even the most discerning Tolkien neophytes were satisfied. With this year's installment, 'The Two Towers', Jackson has become more daring, and has taken several liberties with the story line, most notably, excluding the last 5 chapters. Yet I want to specify something to all the Tolkien addicts who are most enraged by this blatant cut: word-for-word adaptations rarely ever work. In adapting a novel to the screen, something is invariably lost if the director does not have the wits to put the film in his vision rather than the author. If the author wanted to make a film he would have instead of writing a book. I believe, most strongly, in a dapting a book to the screen, one must take the general emotions the book generates, and do everything possible to bring them to the audience. In Tolkien, these emotions are invariably a sense of joy and wonder, something he certainly instilled with the first volume. Yet now, it has been a year, and many people (like me) have seen the fellowship so many times we can recite it line by line. The wonder is no longer new, and the joy somewhat dimmed by our familiarty with the perils of Middle-earth. In 'The Two Towers', Jackson takes our familiarty, and enhances upon it, bringing us deeper into the characters and the realm of Tolkien's universe. It's not the same as the book, but it most certainly works.</fullReview>

Well, the fact that he pulled it off astounds me. Would that J. R. R. Tolkien could be here to see the results of Mr. Jackson's (and so many other's!) hard work. I believe he'd be pleased and proud.I have to say my favorite bits of The Two Towers happen during the last 30 minutes or so, when the just film becomes one visually stunning image after the next.

		<fullReview>Smash hit sequel to 2001's "Fellowship of the Ring," but is notably more fast-paced and more exciting. Director Peter Jackson restores the wonder and grandeur of Middle-earth, all while staying faithful to the book's narrative (although there is more humor and adds a interesting Eowyn/Aragorn/Arwen love triangle).Newcomers Brad Dourif (best known for his voice work as Chucky in the "Child Play" movies) and Miranda Otto are surprisingly effective in their key roles as Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, daughter of Theoden the king, although they play second fiddle to Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, and the rest of the stellar cast. Andy Serkis imbues computer-generated Gollum with wit and energy. The movie does have its flaws. Most of the time is spent on where Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go, while not spending ample time on Frodo and Sam's and Merry and Pippin's journey. Also, like "Fellowship", the movie just... ends. Flaws aside, this a magnificently produced and made film that should not be missed.PG-13; Violence, gore, battle sequences, and scary images.</fullReview>

From the opening scene where Gandalf is tumbling down the cave with the Balrog (amazing) you know you are in for a treat. I just could not stop smiling.The battles are much bigger and the enemies are more evil, at times attacking one another in a scene near the beginning of the film.The work done on Gollum is just astounding, after about five minutes of trying to work out where the polygons and lines are, you kind of forget altogether that he is computer generated and feel for him as a real person. You can really see Andy Serkis' performance shine through this character.Another hit, another must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the changes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Star Wars Universe is almost dead to me. George Lucas has destroyed that world beyond repair now. Prequels and 'Special Editions' have ruined what was once pure and good. What hope is there now? What do we have to fill the void?Like a light in the darkness came Peter Jackson's inspiring and ambitious attempt to take the greatest piece of historical fiction of all time, and turn it into a trilogy of movies. Fellowship of the Ring has escalated to one of my favourite movies of all time in the span of a year. As Two Towers approached, many wondered if it was just a fluke, if Jackson had used up all his fairy dust on the first one. Then the movie came, and all fears subsided.Mostly.I do love these movies, and Fellowship and Two Towers are both outstanding films. What really got me, though, was that there were some glaring deviances from the books in the second movie. In Fellowship, any changes that took place, or new scenes, could be explained as if they had happened during the course of their journey but hadn't been written in the books. In Two Towers, they made huge detours and character changes. There were several differences that, for some reason, really bothered me. Luckily these aren't the majority.Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I'll just touch on the changes that bothered me most. What happened to Faramir? Why had his personality and 'quality' changed so much from the books? The changes made in the films put the ring in IMPOSSIBLE peril, from which the hobbits should not have escaped. Maybe it makes for a more exciting sequence, but it doesn't make sense based on previously established facts about the enemy or the ring.Other things that bothered me: Wouldn't Merry or Pippin have referred to Gandalf by name before he 'remembers' it later? If there are 2000 Rohirrim, why do you only see about 50 when the party first encounters them? What did Treebeard THINK Sauruman was burning over there in Isengard? I won't mention anything else at risk of giving away too much.The rest of the film more than makes up for these differences. The excellent battle at Helms Deep, the Golden Hall at Edoras, Wormtongue, and the Dead Marshes are all elements that show why this movie belongs next to its excellent predecessor.This movie is far and away better than most of the fare out there. A worthy addition to an excellent series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2002.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**There are a handful of issues I have with this movie. I thought the cross-cutting between stories was disjointing due to the vastly different paces of each tale. I noticed a few blatant blue screen shots. Some of the dialogue seemed out of place, almost hokey. And on top of all of that, the film suffered from being the middle one in a trilogy, a film that by definition did not contain a true start or finish.Having said all of that, I still choose it as my best film of 2002 for this reason. After I saw "Chicago," I sneaked across the theater hall to catch the last half hour of "Two Towers" again. Not even close. I thoroughly enjoyed "Chicago" (#2 or #3 of 2002), but "Two Towers" was simply on another level. It completely swept me away into Middle Earth as I relished the final battle for Helm's Deep. Gandalf and company streaking down the hill into the enemy was one of the best movie moments of the year. The emotion seemed quite real, and even the slight melodrama didn't bother me at all.Other highlights...the opening sequence of Gandalf and the Balrog was excellent, yanking the audience back into the story as though they never left. All the battle scenes were not only epic, but cohesive. Some directors just don't seem to know how to put a fluid and continuous battle together (see "Gladiator"). But these (Helm's Deep primarily) were fantastic, ranking among the best ever on film.Bottom line: The best movies pull you into their world, make you feel their emotions, and relate to their characters. "Two Towers" did all that and more, which is quite remarkable given the adventurous and fantastical nature of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the Fellowship of the Ring and was greatly anticipating this film. This film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. Effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that I thought this movie had far less substance. The best part of the movie is Golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? Unfortunately he was the only character in this movie I found myself caring about. About all you get from Gimliy and Legalos are a BOMBARDMENT of simply awful jokes. Going alongside the wall at helms deep WAS humorous when you come by Gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, "Shall I fetch you a box." No thanks Mr. Elf I would prefer a mute button. Going back to Gimliy again, I found it very annoying that Treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. The battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie I had trouble believing in "the reality of the movie". Examples include... - Legolas was taking out the Orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, This I am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the Orc with the torch resembling a character from The Road Warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. This is also the same character that said when the Orcs were a rather far distance from Helmsdeep to aim for there Necks and Underarms. This brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - Legalos told them to shoot at the Necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. Well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. The scene that I am talking about where Legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull I don't want to see the movie again if I have to watch that. I was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. It truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. These people are defending there families and I can't take that seriously when I have elf man sliding away. - The central Characters are far to powerfull in this movie. When Aragorn and Gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -When the men who capture Frodo and Sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -And finally... there is no was I can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either Sam or Frodo when they were at the Gates of Mordor. There little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there.I suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not "nitpick" like me. I do think the movie is GOOD but it is far from great and IMHO not worthy of a Best Picture nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank heavens for Peter Jackson. The out-of-the-blue Aussie auteur, previously best known for the 1996 Michael J. Fox bomb The Frighteners, has managed to deliver where so many others have failed, or feared to even attempt. He has successfully translated J.R.R. Tolkien's massive Lord of the Rings trilogy to the big screen with maximum verve and minimal crap. Last year's Fellowship of the Ring scored a bulls-eye with moviegoers and critics alike, and there was an audible sigh of relief among hardcore LOTR fanatics when the long-awaited film was finally released to smashing success.So, where does Mr. Jackson go from there? He took a gamble in filming all three of the LOTR movies one after the other - what if Fellowship tanked? The whole franchise would have been up the creek. Thankfully, that fear was soon vanquished, but now Jackson has yet another roadblock to overcome: expectation. Hype. Buzz. Fellowship set the standard for Jackson and his crew - now all they can do is surpass it. That's a lot of pressure. I mean, a LOT of pressure. Thus, The Two Towers is arguably the most important film in the trilogy, simply because it has to live up to the expectations of millions of LOTR fans, AND the general movie going public, AND the critics, AND the studios that pay for the whole shebang. I'm amazed that Jackson hasn't had a stroke by now, or at least one mother of an ulcer.So when all is said and done, does The Two Towers deliver? Yes. Is it as good as Fellowship? No. Does it still kick ass? For the most part, yes. It's just not very graceful doing it.Simply put, The Two Towers is an exhausting movie. By the end, I felt like I'd been through a war zone. The film is just SO LONG, and there is SO MUCH GOING ON, from epic battles to flowery speeches to zombified swamps to talking trees....the first word that came to mind when I left the theater was "overstuffed". I feel like I'm beating on a dead horse, though - these movies are complete adaptations of the novels, and as such, there's going to be a whole lot of stuff packed into 3 hours. But even so, those 3 hours don't have to feel like 6. I can see where Jackson and company could have trimmed a bit here, shuffled a bit there, moved around a few parts here, just to make the narrative flow more freely. TTT's plot is heaps more complex than Fellowship's, and the best way to deal with that is to tell the story in the simplest, most direct way possible. But Jackson jumps back and forth between plot lines like Quentin Tarantino on speed, and it just doesn't work. This may be Jackson's way of keeping us from getting bored, but it's ultimately distracting and unnecessary. Yes, there are a lot of plot threads to juggle - from Frodo and Sam's descent into hell, to Aragorn's crew trying to rescue Merry and Pippin, to Merry and Pippin themselves just trying to stay alive, and more subplots than you can shake a wizard's staff at - but they should be juggled, not thrown into the air and allowed to crash back to Earth. The plot itself is average at best, and when coupled with the smothering story structure, makes for a rather underwhelming experience.Fortunately, there is still plenty of good here, and a whole lot of great. The performances are once again top-notch, save for some flat dialogue and a few stilted scenes. The characters still feel the need to turn every sentence into a poetic work of art, Arwen still needs a shot of caffeine, and Frodo and Sam still need to get a room already, but otherwise the acting is very good. The gorgeous scenery and cinematography are back in full force, and it's likely the best eye candy you'll taste all year. The world of Middle-Earth just comes alive on screen - it's like you're RIGHT THERE. I don't know about you, but I'm booking myself a vacation to New Zealand ASAP.But where TTT really shines is, yes, the butt kicking. The battle scenes are simply breathtaking (and cringe-inducing at some points - dammit, that sword just came right at my face!), and the final showdown at Helm's Deep is just unbelievable. There's so much buildup, and such palpable tension, that when the battle finally occurs it feels like you're going to war right alongside Aragorn and the Elves. There are so many fighters on screen, so much attention to detail, so much pure EXCITEMENT that I simply couldn't take my eyes off the spectacle, not even for a second (or a much-needed bathroom break). Oh, and Gandalf is alive. But you probably already knew that.There are certain things that work in The Two Towers, and there are things that don't. Unfortunately, the good doesn't outweigh the bad, so TTT manages to find a fairly neutral middle ground. Will The Two Towers disappoint LOTR fans? Probably not. Will it disappoint everyone else? It's hard to say. But one thing is for sure: TTT is an experience you won't forget. Just try to ignore the rampant Hobbit homoeroticism, and you'll have a blast.My Grade: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was always going to be difficult to equal the fellowship, and the two towers doesn't.I have now seen it three times and I really do enjoy it. However, some of the scenes and the dialogue are so awful that should never have seen the light of day.The ongoing Antipodean joke about Dwarf tossing is simply unnecessary, and why does John Rhys Davies do the voice of Treebeard. Indeed it is the Ents that were the most disappointing part for me. They were always going to be difficult, but I found their deevelopment as characters superficial and the storyline fluctuated between being true to Tolkein and expediency.I will see this film again and again because I really do like it, but I suspect many attracted to the story by the fellowship will be put off by this attempt at developing the story. And as for Legolas skateboarding down the stairs on shield - it just isn't needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go to this movie because you enjoyed the books and want to see that played out on screen before you, you will probably be dissapointed with the changes made.People who worship the books will probably like FOTR better, its more true to the books. If you go to this movie to see a good movie, and aren't to picky about changes, you will most likely be swept away and think of it as one of your favorites. People who don't care if its changed will like this better.I read the books and overall enjoyed them, but they got a bit boring at some points. When I saw the 1st movie the first time, I thought that nothing was better, but after seeing it several times I realized it did tended to drag at points. This one pretty much kept me awake at all times.Gollum is excellent, the best computer generated character ever created, he's always been my favorite character in the book. The acting is fair, the action is great, the special effects are pretty well done, but are a little cheesy at points.</fullReview>

The Lord of the Rings saga has enough action and story for anyone without inventing bits like Aragorn's fall which did nothing for the story and nearly killed the actor in the process!I can't see how Return of the King will hang together now as too many events not in the book have changed the story now.Alas, an opportunity missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most impressive and spectacular epic ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not enough words to describe how wonderful, imaginative, powerful, impressive, spectacular and great this film is. And believe me, this are the words from someone who has a very open mind about films. Very few films have managed to come across with such power on the screen. The first film was a great achievement, and by the time I saw it I just could not believe how it could be surpassed. But it did, it really did. Maybe not on an emotional level, because by necessity, this film can't stand alone. It's only the middle chapter, it doesn't have a real beggining or a real ending. But surprisingly, it does enough with it's characters to care about the story.I will not get into describing the story, because you all know what it is about. What I do want to describe it's how well it's the story told and how well the film is done. This film is certainly much darker than it's predecessor, and more violent, too. And there is also an interesting thing about it: it doesn't exactly feels like a fantasy film, precisely because it looks so real, and partly because most of the story centers in the country of Rohan, the world of men. There are not a lot of "fantastic" places here. But that does not harm the film, because in a way, it makes the film feel more like one of those great epics such as Braveheart.The visual effects are the most impressive ones I have ever seen. At least for the last hour of the film (which centers on the now famous Helm's Deep battle scene), there are some images that I never even imagined in my dreams. There are, some really wonderful and AWE-inspiring shots that look....amazing. And...of course, there's Gollum, the most believable CGI creature I have ever seen (and a compelling character, too).What I loved about 'The Two Towers', is that it's the kind of film you don't see very often. It's one of those very very few films that leave you thinking about it for a LONG time. It's great on every aspect. It's the kind of film where you'd have to write a big review for how well the story is told, how amazing the direction is, how good the acting is, how impressive the visual effects are, how dark, dramatic, violent, heroic and inspiring it is, and...how lovable it is.10 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Wow. If you thought 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was the best movie you'd ever seen, you're about to change your mind! As the second installment of both the books and the movies, 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is an incredible cinematic achievement. It follows the journey of the Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), and his companion, Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin). They are on their way to Mordor, the only place where the one Ring can be destroyed. The ring has proceeded to take over Frodo's mind, and he is always feeling it getting heavier and wanting to slip it on.As Aragorn/Strider, a ranger, Viggo Mortensen gives an amazing performance definitely deserving of an Academy Award. He, Legolas Greenleef (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli son of Gloin (John Rhys-Davies) are on a path to find two young hobbits, Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), who have been captured by orcs.For those of you who have wanted to see a girl have at least a marginal amount of combat skills in a Lord of the Rings movie, your wish has come true. Éowyn (Miranda Otto) has a role of which shows girls can be fighters, too.Overall, the best movie I've seen as yet. I highly recommend it to all of you, whether you are LOTR fans or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was greatly disappointed with this movie. It is my evaluation that it unlike movie nr-1, deviates to much from the original story. It seemes to me that the director have altered this second part, focusing on action parts, instead of following the original story. The battle at Helms deep may be incredible, but it is taking to much time of the story. Some of the new charecters (like Faramir), acts different then in the book, when he kidnaps Frodo and Sam, taking them into battle. Finally it disappointed me that we dont get to the end of the book when the film stops.Its a relatively good film, but still not near as good as "Fellowship of the ring".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my mom, my cousins and a friend to see this for Christmas, and we were very pleased. Yes, it strayed somewhat from the book, but the book would have been difficult to capture any closer without ruining it.The two biggest differences are where the movie ends as opposed to the novel, and the subplot with Arwen. These were needed to make a better movie (and to further explain the events in the upcoming Return of the King)and are not very significant if you take these into consideration. ((((SPOILER))))I have heard people say that wolf-riders aren't in the book, but there is a sentence in the novel in it that refers to them.On the theatrical area, the acting is good. Not great, but just right to set the mood. The special affects are excellent, capturing the wonder and terror. Also, the writting is great, and there are numerous quotes that will go down in history. My cousins loved the character of Gollum, who was hillarious, saddening and even treacherous at times. Andy Serkis is probably the best actor in the movie. Over All: **** out of ****.

		<fullReview>The diluted darkness of the Star Wars prequels is eclipsed by Sauron's shadow in The Two Towers!Director Peter Jackson reprises the narrative cue of Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) and, forsaking any introduction, embarks on a deeper, introspective and urgent deconstruction of the psychology that underpins the now fragmented fellowship; the Ring's seduction of Frodo, the tragedy of Gollum (a true synthespian) and the heroics of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen a revelation), Gimli and Legolas.Visually. Rivendell's redolent beauty is replaced by nightfall, ruin and decay. The Elves, in their haste to elude Sauron, accelerated the corruption of the landscape. This aesthetic is maintained throughout most of the film and recapitulates the theme of darkness falling, but light is not entirely driven into shadow.The battle at Helm's Deep delivers in ways that no Clone War could ever emulate - an epic confrontation from a very human perspective.In between the moments of dark reflection there are those that are life-affirming. None has more poignancy than that of Gandalf?s return.If there is a fly in the ointment it is the Balrog! This ?mythical? beast appears to have escaped from a console game and should have evoked memories of the T-Rex attack from Jurassic Park.Despite my serious reservations surrounding this project. Peter Jackson has surprised and delighted with both Fellowship and Towers. Will it be three times the charm or will the trials of the trilogy be insurmountable even for this master of the ring?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still a masterpiece. Though RotK will probably end up being my favorite. This movie just screams epic.I guess I didn't like it as much as FotR because it was missing some quiet scenes that FotR had. Some breaks in the pacing in order to give a rest to the characters and viewer. But then again, the pacing of breaking the story up into three parts really helped the narrarative and gave more consistent flow to the movie that was missing in FotR and made it seem a tad long.Speaking of which, it may be criticised for being long...but what great masterpiece isn't long? The more time you have, the more stuff you can fit in, and if the stuff you're fitting in is good...there's no problemo. Heck, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption and other top 10 IMDB movies are as long if not LONGER then FotR and TTT. I really just don't get complaints about length, because what it's really all about is consitency in the pacing. TTT went by FAST for me, while some movies like say Little Buddah are just 2 hours...yet that felt like an eternity.Anyways, enough of my ranting. Great movie. Won't win best picture this year though (Chicago has the oscars wrapped up, don't ask me why, I'll never know). Though, RotK will most definitely win next year, as if to honor the series as a whole, and it'd definitly deserve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think my way of judging this film(s) (so far only the two)is that after reading the Lord of the Rings for the first time in 1970 it was a heck of a long wait to see the story transformed into a movie(s). I feel somewhat privileged to have finally been able to witness this transformation after a 30 some year wait and although the wait was long it was somewhat justified by the excellence of the films. Also there is not the fear that the project will end before the finish (this time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings for LOTR: The Two Towers. I loved FOTR. LOVED it. Sure, there were some differences from Tolkien's story here and there that I thought could have been avoided, the most obvious being Arwen at the Ford, but they didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. Two Towers is a different story. I know that this is just one man's interpretation of Tolkien's work, and that there will never be a movie version of a book that adheres completely to the book, but some of the changes Peter Jackson made here are too much in my opinion. Without a doubt, the most upsetting to me were the changes to the Frodo/Sam/Faramir arc of the story, especially the butchering of Faramir's character. Gone is the noble warrior I know and love from the book. He's replaced with, basically, a second coming of his brother Boromir. Whatever happened to the Faramir that said, "I would not take this thing {the Ring}, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and glory."? Jackson's Faramir is a complete contradiction of Tolkien's Faramir. I can only hope that the true Faramir is shown in Return of the King.Another disappointment is the handling of Gimli's character. I have nothing against comic relief--I think comic relief is actually necessary in a movie as dark and tense as this one--but Peter Jackson pushed it a little far. Gimli was supposed to be a fierce warrior to be taken seriously, not a barrel of laughs.Now that the bad stuff's out of the way, there were some things that I loved about TTT. First of all, Gollum. Brilliantly done! The CGI was excellent. Andy Serkis did a marvelous job with his voice and movements. I loved his back-and-forth conversations with himself as well. And the fish-and-chips scene was priceless! I was so glad that they included that.Helm's Deep was magnificent. Not as close to the book as it could have been, but this is one place where it didn't bother me as much. I actually think that having Elves at Helm's Deep was one of the better changes Jackson made. And one of the best scenes in the movie was Gandalf's charge down the mountain towards the Uruk-hai, the Rohirrim riding behind. The music especially makes this an incredible scene, one that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.Wormtongue was another highlight of the movie. I thought he was played to perfection by Brad Dourif, just creepy and sinister enough. The scene between him and Eowyn made my skin crawl.The Storming of Isengard was outstanding. I didn't like the way the Ents had to be tricked into going to war, but the Storming helps to make up for it. Brilliantly done, and the look on Saruman's face was just priceless.Overall, this was not as good as FOTR, but still a good movie. There were some changes from Tolkien's story that were definite disappointments, but TTT still has enough good stuff to be worth multiple viewings. I give it 7 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see The Two Towers, there was two very stupid girls next to me giggling the entire time. I then found out after the movie that my best friend who went with me sat next to a couple who "made-out" for about a half hour. Not even that could take the fun out of watching the movie. Not only do I love the books, I also love the actors who portray the characters so well. It is without a doubt better than the first. Although there aren't many happy moments in The Two Towers, the adventures of the characters are the main part of the story. I give the Two Towers an A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sequel! Though The Two Towers wasn't quite as good as Fellowship of the Ring, it was still a great movie. **** and 1/2 out of *****. More things were changed in The Two Towers than in Fellowship of the Ring, but still a great job by Peter Jackson. Though a lot of people criticize the appearance of the Elves at Helms Deep, I highly compliment it, and think that it was really cool. Helms Deep! I almost finished this review without talking about it. This, folks, may well be the greatest battle put up on the big screen. One of the many great things about it is that it is not constant action. It switches back and forth to other scenes, so you're not constantly in the massive battle, which I like. But there certainly is plenty of the battle that you can digest. (Notice Peter Jackson's cameo in Helms Deep as he throws a spear.) The main problem with this movie is that they wasted too much time with added scenes. The sequel to this movie, the Return of the King, must be at least 3:45. The Two Towers just didn't have quite enough of the real book in it, but it was still really great. And Gollum! The best CGI character put on screen. The scene in the night where Smeagol and Gollum are talking to each other is one of the best scenes in movie history. This is an absolute must-see, but you must see the Fellowship of the Ring before this, otherwise you will not get the point of the movie. WOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could anyone think this one was better than the first? (Spoilers, but nothing not already revealed in the trailers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I think THE TWO TOWERS is a good movie. I suppose, if you're tolerant, you might even call it as good as THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. But how could Time magazine run a cover calling it *better* than its predecessor? Its strengths are the same strengths as the first movie's. Its weaknesses, on the other hand, are pretty well its own.Let's review those strengths. Strong, charismatic performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf? Check. Grand, sweeping vistas of the Middle Earth terrain? Check. Epic, savage battle scenes? Check. Dark, brooding cinematography? Check. Danger and the theme of struggle within oneself against the temptations of power? Check. Yep, we have a good movie here; it would take a lot of incompetence to ruin all those elements.But by gosh, sometimes it looks like Jackson tried. Despite sacrificing much more of the story than the first one did, this movie covers less ground; given more than a chapter's head start, it fails to make it anywhere near the final chapter.I find it amazing that so many people focus on what was done to Faramir's character, when far worse was done elsewhere. In fact, I liked what Jackson did to Faramir's character. Tolkien's Faramir is insufferable; give me Samwise's honest humility any day over Faramir's how-noble-were-my-ancestors-before-they-bred-with-lesser-men posturing. I like the fact that Jackson's Faramir feels the same temptation as his brother, but unlike Boromir, he is able to overcome it. Gimli is the one who's been really let down, being completely reduced to a laughingstock. There were a few laughs at his expense in the first movie, but he was also clearly a warrior and a hero. Now he's been made into a useless encumbrance for the sake of comic relief.Both TFOTR and TTT make significant changes from the book. But in the first movie these were well-considered changes, omitting the inessentials and in some cases improving considerably on the book. For one instance, Jackson's Boromir is a much more sympathetic tragic hero than the boor that Tolkien gave us; for another, Jackson's choice to have Aragorn deliberately part from Frodo, afraid that his love for Gondor would tempt him to steal the Ring, is far more dramatic than the fiat of fate Tolkien used. In TTT, the changes are not nearly so well thought out. Consider the decision to have Theoden be directly possessed by Saruman. Okay, that could have worked. But Jackson overlooks the fact that this possession makes Grima the Wormtongue totally superfluous. Grima's only job, influencing the King, is no longer necessary, and his presence in the court puts Saruman's plans at risk of discovery. Either Grima should have been edited out completely, or the possession business should have been canned. Also, since Jackson retains the scene where Grima is expelled, he should also have retained Tolkien's far superior version of it, where Grima is given a chance to redeem himself and throws it away.In the first movie, Arwen sensibly appears only when she is relevant to the action. Her love scenes with Aragorn are well woven into the course of the story. Here, while her scenes are quite well done in themselves, they are sometimes intrusive, and in several cases it is obvious that they should have been saved for the third movie. Arwen's return to a desolate Lothlorien is one of the most tragic, heart-rending scenes Tolkien ever wrote, a perfect conclusion to the story of the Third Age. To anticlimactically stick this scene into the middle of the second book is unforgivable.Finally, I object to the Ents being reduced to incompetents who don't even notice what Saruman is doing to their trees until a Hobbit shoves it under their noses.The only possible claim TTT has to superiority over the TFOTR is Andy Serkis' Gollum. I was terrified of getting another Jar-Jar Binks; instead Gollum is one of the best CGI characters I've ever seen, very Hobbit-like while still being beastish. Serkis makes Gollum menacing and pitiable at the same time. He is probably the truest character to Tolkien's vision in either of the two movies.So, take THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, slow it down, remove Sean Bean and Ian Holm, two of the best actors in it, greatly reduce Ian McKellen's role, and replace the well-judged changes from Tolkien's story with modifications that appear to have been thought up at the last minute. You now have THE TWO TOWERS. Is it good? Yes. Is it an improvement? No.Rating: **? out of ****.Recommendation: See it in the theater, but don't set your expectations too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A class act thunders on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson wastes no time with prologues or resume's in this breathless, no nonsense mid-point to his ground breaking trilogy. Apart from a brief reprise of Gandalf's fate to deliver a rousing opening, its straight on from where the original story left off as the Fellowship, now divided into three clear factions, pursue their individual fates.In being denied both a begining an an end, the film is inevitably more episodic than its predecessor and the story is less clearly defined and progressive. Indeed one of the film's few real flaws is that after three exhausting hours of spectacle the story has not really moved on in any meaningful way. Jackson compensates for this by delivering a full-blooded action adventure, more grounded in genuine fantasy than 'Fellowship' with no compromises made on the more fantastic elements of Tolkien's imagination, such as the tree-like Ents, which might have been by-passed by a less confident director. If the action and special effects are more to the forefront in this effort than the characterisation of 'Fellowship', it is a consequence of the plot and Jackson's need for some rather brutal editing to stick within three hours. It will be interesting to see if his special edition DVD restores some of the character balance lost here. For all that, the actors continue to get plenty of opportunity to show their worth, particularly Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen, whose heroic, leading man status is cemented here. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are dissappointingly underused this time around and even Elizah Wood becomes more marginalised (again a reflection of the book).Inevitably, the real star here is Jackson himself; ceaselessly inventive, bold, uncompromising, relishing the detail and sheer mad imagination of Tolkien's text, he delivers an exhilerating spectacle. What next for the Kiwi Hobbit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the first one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that's saying a LOT, seeing as how I rated that a 10+/10. And I normally have little interest in the whole "Sword &amp; Sorcery" genre, so my high praise means even more than usual. They were wise to film all three LOTR movies at the same time, for it means the 2nd follows the style of the first seamlessly. These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed. It's a shame this (like its predecessor) will probably be snubbed for Best Picture Oscar because it's obvious to anyone other than a complete dullard that these are landmark films whose appeal will long outlast the other Oscar contenders10+/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie up to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the cinema to see this movie (this was on the premiere night) I had huge expectations, because I liked the first film very much and I'm also a fan of the books. And the film met up with the expectations and was even better. When I left the cinema I really wanted to see the film a second time (which I did later on), not to mention how I absolutely longed for the third film.Why I loved the film is hard to say. I really love fantasy, especially Tolkien, and I really like Peter Jackson movies, but this isn't enough to make me give a movie 10 out of 10. I really don't know what made it so good, if it was something special or just a combination of lots of small goodies. It's simply totally perfect.As a last comment I think it sucks that this film has only been nominated for six Oscars. Personally I think it should've gotten as many nominations as the first film (13), and it should get most of them (at least 12 so it gets the most ever). But now when it's only six, we can just hope that it gets all of those. I really hope that the third film gets more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to "the return of the king", this second story has lack of fantastic things. "the return of the king" has fantastic and interesting story such as a fantastic novel. but this is seen as it's the war movie between humans and monsters. it was the almost whole story that humans who support Rohan empire including elves and a great number of monsters led by Saruman fought each other. there is almost neither the appearance of mysterious characters nor the new fantastic story.But it's great in its visual effect. perhaps you might not see such a spectacular war in any other movies but this movie. the desperate scenes between about hundred of thousands monsters to occupy the castle and many warriors to keep it were very tense and nervous as much as I can't take my eyes off the movie screen. although this movie failed in story, the reason it could have many attendants may depend on the success of its visual effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like it or not, 'Lord Of The Rings' is ONE movie. It's the precedent of a very brave commitment made by a single studio to tell an epic story...on the grand scale that it deserves. To say that one installment is better (or worse) than the other 2 installments, is the same as taking ANY movie; splitting it in 3 equal parts; then analyzing which section is better. Go Ahead! Try It! Pick Any Movie.Definitely...'The Two Towers' adaptation is getting more screen time. And I've enjoyed the artistic license that Jackson and Co took to let the story unfold and accelerate. Bookwise...'Two Towers' ain't over yet.All the actor/characters have fleshed out their counterparts beyond expectation (already proven in 'Fellowship...). Gollum's performance is deservedly unanimous (and loved those Ents too...hey it's a fantasy!) And glad to see the Wargs make their debut that featured in Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'Fellowship of the Ring' (the "Journey in the Dark" chapter); but were sorely missing up till now. Also loved how Jackson inserted Gandalf's battle with the Balrog.10 out of 10! (Same as the 1st one...can't wait till the last one)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excited wasn't the word for this. I was giddy as a school girl (so to speak) and was looking forward to a cinematic treat. And I wasn't disappointed.Firstly I have to say a big thanks to new line for not giving us too many spoilers. I know us fans know what happens (hey, we can read!) but we don't know how it happens (if you follow me). For example, we had tantalising glimpses of Gollum in FOTR. But he was kept carefully under wraps. And for that, new line, I salute you. In the week leading up to the original MIB I had seen trailer upon trailer, music videos, making of's and every interview and clip you can think of. I had, essentially, seen every moment of that film. So the impact had been lost and my enjoyment dulled. Not so The Two Towers.As I went in blind, everything blew me away. Sure, the adverts gave us a few minutes of Helms Deep and a Bit of Eowyn here and there, but nothing major. Everything came to me fresh and kicked a lot of ass. Amazingly enough, the thrill was still there even on my second and third viewings. High praise indeed.With a few viewings it becomes obvious that PJ has captured the essence of the second book, while skilfully leaving out the things he could get away with. For example, the meeting of the Ents and all their songs are, quite frankly, dull and we are well rid of them. The pacing is superb. It never seems to drag and every scene is welcome. It was a hard job following the superb Fellowship but PJ has done us proud.Helms Deep, the centre piece of the film, is just enthralling. From the tear jerking scenes of young boys getting tooled up for war to the rousing sight of Gandalf leading the charge, we are assaulted by a bombastic mix of sound and sights. I can safely say, without hyperbole, that it is simply one of the most phenomenal scenes in cinematic history. A review of Two Towers wouldn't be complete without a mention of the Gollum. The character is just brilliant. Retaining all the pitiable characteristics of the book. The inner conflict scene had me close to tears!The standard has now been set. The bar has been raised. Fellowship and The Two Towers stand head and shoulders above almost any film I have seen. The quality of them is awe inspiring. My problem now is waiting for the extended DVD. And Return of the King. And how hard is Legolas? He is just a killing machine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has come to this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even today, as a writer, having been through J.R.R. Tolkien's Ring Trilogy twice, once for the journey and the second time somewhat more analytically, I can barely comprehend how Tolkien did it; how he managed to fashion a world of such minute detail, and with scope that was at once physical, temporal and emotional. Is the Trilogy literature? Maybe not by strict definition; its concern is not so much with ideas as with pure language, English specifically, and what can be done with this amazing tool. The tale itself seems, at times, to exist only as a hanger for Tolkien's aesthetic experiments with the evocative aspect of language, how words sound, and how that quality can be made to resonate in the mind of the tuned-in reader: Galadriel, Celeborn, Umbar, Forlindon, Dimrill Dale, Withywindle, Rivendell, Mordor; words that often sound more like wind chimes or gonging bells than words, all strung together with equally melodious text.When I learned that Tolkien was coming seriously to the big screen, I was stoked, although memories of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's similarly monumental novel, Dune, had me a bit worried. One feature-length film, despite the great beauty of many of its elements, had not been enough to properly set up and display Dune's particular richness of detail and the movie tended to stumble about trying to hit a sufficient number of the book's high spots (though I still love the sequence in which House Atreides departs Caladan for Arrakis; the stately embarkation into the Guild Heighliners). It was a film that could only really work for those who had read and loved the novel. But Tolkien was to be served up in three (count 'em!) parts. Having seen the first two of the three, I have not been disappointed.When the first installment bypassed Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, the choices Peter Jackson had been forced to make were obvious. I'm sure they weren't always easy ones. Many of the Trilogy's more subtle elements had to be bypassed. For example, the book's spooky view of the Black Rider on the Buckleberry Ferry stage, seen by lantern light from across the river as the Hobbits flee the Shire - a favorite interlude of mine - was really more effective and evocative than the film's narrow escape of screeching hooves. But the gorgeous pursuit of Arwen and Frodo from Weathertop by the Ringwraiths, with its breathtaking overhead cut to the full-gallop chase, put everything back in balance. The Fellowship of The Rings was so good that it may not have been necessary to have read the Trilogy first. But in the case of The Two Towers, reading first is highly recommended. This done, the second film which must, to some degree, only imply its particular book, will play all the more richly.In the Two Towers, both in print and on screen, the story's U-shaped arc reaches its low-point before starting its climb to the end. It is the Trilogy's most challenging phase, for both reader and viewer. There was no way that the contemporary narrative cinema, with its rather rigid constraints, could have rendered it faithfully. Peter Jackson, a director of great skill and intelligence, obviously knew this as well. He taketh away but he also giveth back: eye-candy scenery, an FX for the ages in Gollum (underpinned by actor Andy Serkis' excellent performance; he blue-suited the part in real time to optimize the digital Gollum's relationships with the living actors), great Ents, and action that makes the clashes in Braveheart seem like square dances. The battle at Helm's Deep is riveting. Staged in the rain, like Kurosawa's climatic battle in the Seven Samurai, you can almost forget to breathe as the sequence unfolds.To bring a written work like the Ring Trilogy to the screen; one with which readers had already formed deep connections, took guts, not to mention great movie-making skill. Because Tolkien's characters are so vividly drawn, great sensitivity and precision in casting was also required. In that light, all main characters are spot-on, often exactly as I envisioned them in the books. Frodo is just a bit too pretty, yet still authentically portrayed by Elijah Woods, who fans out the full deck of Frodo's emotions, from grit through fright, with great clarity. But with Frodo accompanied by Sean Astin's letter-perfect Sam Gamgee, all remains well. The memory of Ian Holm's equally-perfect Bilbo makes it even better. Karl Urban's coiled, wild-eyed Julius Caesar was my favorite recurring character in the Xena: Warrior Princess TV series and I enjoyed seeing him in the Two Towers as the equally-coiled Eomer. Cate Blanchett was probably born to play Galadriel but the real, possibly unexpected, thermonuclear casting-event was Craig Parker's elf-captain Haldir. A little make up and some blonde tresses morphed the pleasant-looking Parker into a presence of mythic nobility, as opposed to Orlando Bloom's more intense, wolf-like Legolas. Much of the innate beauty that infuses the entire Trilogy is compressed into Parker's character and I'm not alone here. Haldir websites are sprouting like mushrooms in Fangorn Forest as we speak.It's hard to say anything bad about a production into which so much intelligence, sensitivity, courage, and labor has been poured. What would be the point? There's plenty of cotton candy out there to pull apart. Any film should be judged first in terms of its respective genre. Very few films are truly great across the entire spectrum. At this point, Lord of The Rings is a magnificent achievement, magically pulling together so much of what the cinema can be at this stage in its evolution. The Two Towers is a discrete film but also a necessary and difficult chapter of a larger work. Not all films will be Tolkienesque fantasies. But when such films are made, Lord of The Rings will be the absolute benchmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic in its finest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the standard of epic excellence established by last year's The Fellowship of the Ring. Not only is the acting noteworthy, but the cinematography and special effects make Star Wars pale in comparison. Peter Jackson is obviously a detail junkie. The musical score is grand and most satisfying to hear. The depiction of the Battle of Helms Deep defies explanation. After seeing The Fellowship, I wondered if it was possible to improve on the special effects seen there. Well, it was and is possible -- much to my surprise and delight. This is a film that will be a film classic for eternity. It doesn't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have seen this year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to The Two Towers. I thought that "Fellowship of the Ring" was good, but just so-so. Certainly not worth all the hype and Oscar nominations.This film bored me to tears for the first 2 hours. The last hour was good - if only the rest of the film could have been as interesting. I literally almost walked out of the theatre during the first two hours - and I NEVER walk out on movies.I can't believe it was nominated for Best Picture this year. I can't believe that everyone who voted for it actually SAT THROUGH it! No way!Yes, the cinematography, sound, and other technical aspects are all top notch. But that doesn't make up for the flaws, namely:- lack of a plot - or at least an understandable plot- lack of a reprise (however briefly) of what happened in the first movie to remind stupid people like me where we are in the story. I couldn't follow what was going on.- way too too too long- many elements seemed stolen from other films - perhaps they were visualized as they were in the book, but since I haven't read the book I don't know. Moving trees like in "Wizard of Oz". Gollum is the same as Dobby from "Harry Potter". The dwarf with the height problem is really identical to Hagrid from same "Harry Potter". Even the big elephants reminded me of the huge walking things from "The Empire Strikes Back."If you want to see beautiful footage of New Zealand, watch the Travel Channel. The ONLY saving grace out of this whole movie was Sean Astin, whom, as in the first one, is the only one who seems to be really emoting and who seems to understand what he is saying. He is a great actor.I want my 3 hours back!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not agree with the first comment posted on this site; I think that this movie was brilliant. I have read all of Tolkiens books many times, and I can say that Peter Jackson sticks amazingly to the story (ESPECIALLY when compared to other movies based on books) having READ THE BOOKS HIMSELF, not to mention having the help of Ian McKellen. Plus, if all of the book had been put in this movie, it would be several hours longer, those of you who complained. Hmmm... maybe Jackson's going to add those into the 3rd movie, seeing as the 3rd book is the shortest (um, duuuuuh?)! The movie was exciting, beautiful, and brilliantly done.Sexy Elijah Wood gives another splendid performance, and no, the fact that he's sexy and a god is certainly not the reason I give this movie such support. The animation done with Andy Serkis is GREAT. Definitely a winner, to those who haven't AND have read Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

But heck, I can still remember how that fantastic universe made me feel like, and I have to say I felt it once again while watching TTT. Outstanding movie! Actually it's one of the best movies I have seen in the last 10 years. Tolkien's fantasy unfolds before your eyes grace to Peter Jackson's marvelous work. Regarding the casting : each and every character got it's rightful interpreter, as if they were born for it. And the Gollum .. I never thought a cgi would ever make me feel like that. I tried to see harry potter 2 right after TTT and I realised it was such a BIG mistake. I liked the Fellowship of the Ring as well, but the Two Towers is simply outstanding, breathtaking, placing the viewer right in the middle of story, allowing him to be part of everything. THIS is a MOVIE. not just another piece of commercial junk. I'd like to send my deepest respects to everyone involved in the making of LOTR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People can whine all they want that the movie "The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers" isnt the book "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". It isnt, the adaptation may not be perfect, but this is a movie based on the book, not a movie that is a book. In other words, it isnt perfect in that regards, but what film is? Jurassic Park? Jaws? None are pefect. But you also have to look at the fact that part of the book the Two Towers, was included in teh end of the movie Fellowship, so could parts of the book Two Towers be in Return of the King? Possibly, but onto the movie. From Gandalf's battle with the balroc, to the battle of Helm's Deep, this movie as action, action, action. Mix that with an engrossing storyline, interesting characters, and a love for teh Lord of teh Rings, you have a near flawless film. Look at the special effects, they are so good you dont even think about them as being special effects. Rather than using staight up green screen and CGI as in Episode II, LOTR:TTT flawless mixes computer graphics, the most detailed models ever created for film, and great acting. Peter Jackson and co. used a method like the one in T2. Do it in real life it looks real and good enough, if not use puppet, animatronic, and models, if those dont work well enough, then revert to CG. And it shows, not only in the special effects, but in the gerneral care taken to make this film as fun and interesting for both LOTR freaks, and common moviegoers alike. Shame on the Academy for snubbing this film from some Oscars it deserves to win. Like make-up, the best of the year, they dont even get a nomination. Or how about Peter Jackson as Best Director? No dought they will probally give the Best Picture Award to some film like "Chicago", rather then the classy and undeniably breathtaking "Two Towers". But as for the film, I highly recommend it and give it 5 Stars. ***** out of *****. The Best Picture of the Year. Bring on "Return of the King"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well well, there it is, the sequel to this popular series, if you saw my comments for the first one, there is no more things to say that it is a very boring movie. There is more action in the end but that's it. Liv Tyler is only good in one movie, One Night at McCool's! In that film she was a real woman. We could see how she loves to tease a man. I know she does not have huge natural breasts but at least she could be horny and a little bit nymphomaniac like every woman should be. Back to the two towers, well, let me say one more thing, go watch Xena, at least Xena was sexy. Here is the story thanks to Will.The Fellowship has been broken. Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun...I want to see Chloe Vevrier, Autumn Jade and Julia Miles in the third one, if they don't, then return of the king will be like the others, boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hope is not lost...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo falls down over and over again in the face of overwhelming danger. After all, he is inexperienced against the perils outside the Shire. He falls down with his friends running from Farmer Maggot, onto Buckleberry Ferry after being chased by a Ringwraith, in the Prancing Pony, while being attacked by the Ringwraiths on Weathertop, on the snowy mountain, in the Mines of Moria vs. the Cave Troll, after running from Boromir when he takes off the ring. But he always gets up again and perseveres, sometimes on his own sometimes with the help of others in the fellowship. This is an important theme again in the Two Towers. Several story lines revolve and evolve simultaneously in a suspenseful tapestry of hope, courage, and strength confronting and prevailing over the Two Towers of evil: in Isengard (Saruman) and Mordor (Sauron). Frodo, Sam, and Gollum; Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard; Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalph and King Theoden in Rohan; our heroes are bombarded with what appear to be impossible obstacles. Although the bonds of friendships are threatened and tested, hope ultimately overcomes despair, and our heroes continue on their journeys. The complexity of Frodo's and Sam's friendship becomes even more interesting with the arrival of Gollum. Frodo falls again, this time into the marshes, and although we expect Sam to pull him out, (similar to when Frodo saved Sam from drowning in the Fellowship of the Ring), Gollum surprisingly rescues him. Are Gollum's motives strictly driven by greed for the ring, or does he truly become attached in other ways to his new Master? Aragorn is frustrated against overwhelming odds at Helm's Deep, when he helps King Theoden against hordes of Urukhai Orcs. Aragon and Legolas even argue about whether they should involve themselves in what appears to be an impossible fight, although Legolas comes around and admits he should not have given in to despair. Ultimately, the Two Towers of evil are no match for the towers of good that develop amongst our protagonists. Hope is never lost and should never be relinquished to despair, no matter what the adversary. Ironically, I was re-reading the book of the Two Towers at a dental visit recently. The young dentist from Australia was not familiar with the Tolkien books and how long ago they were written. He pointed out the irony of the title in the wake of 9/11/01. There are themes in this excellent movie that are relevant to our present world. The movie makes me want to see more, and I am counting the days until Return of the King. (314 more days until 12/25!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Two Towers' is edgier than 'FOTR' and the highlight is Aragorn's romantic relationship with Arwen. Arwen's decision to stay with Aragorn doesn't stop Elrond (Hugo Weaving mixes paternal protectiveness and vulnerability.) from worrying that she is making the wrong choice. Andy Serkis is a perfect portrait of Gollum's pathos and insanity. I never would have tried to pinch the playfully intense Boromir's face (watch 'FOTR' because Sean Bean should definitely be tamed and seduced like the buck-wild little seducer he is when he's not too saucy!), but his kid brother Faramir (David Wenham reminds me of a puppy that hasn't been housebroken!)is another story because he reminds me of a puppy. Christopher Lee and Ian McKellan are the best as Saruman and Gandalf respectively, especially since the creepy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif is equally creppy and spooky.). I'm buying the special edition because Peter Jackson knows his material.</fullReview>

With that said; why is it that The Two Towers can be nominated for Best Picture...yet Peter Jackson goes un-noticed as a nominee for Best Director? What about Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum/Smeegul? The duality that Mr. Serkis showed in this complex and often missunderstood character was masterful. I for one think he should not only have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor...but should have won it hands down. Once again, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has blown it. Once again a wonderful movie, both beautifuly shot and acted goes un-noticed because it is a "genre film", and thats really too bad. Bravo to Peter Jackson for doing what they said couldn't be done and bravo Andy Serkis for your portrayal that made me both laugh and cry. Oh and to the AMPAS....you blew it....big time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TTT is at times flawed and yet at other times magnificent. Spoilers follow. If I had a wish list I would have liked to see the characters speak a bit more. Yes, it is an adventurous epic action film but much of Tolkien's brilliance occurred when the characters spoke philosophically and with great wit. Saruman seemed more like a stick character rather than an articulate ,cunning wizard , and master of deception. Instead, Grima Wormtongue had too much to say for a lesser charactor. By the way, Grima was finely acted. In fact most of the ensemble cast did great with what little script they had to work with. Special mention needs to go to Aragorn , Eowyn, Arwen, Gimli and Legolas. I would also have liked to have only seen the top half of the ents. Their lower trunks looked silly and were the least effective of the special effects.I also felt that the Balrog scene was a bit too fantastic and SFXy. However, inclusion of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog tells a lot about middle earth and its cosmology.But on the other hand this complex story was made followable and dramatic. The plot differences between the books and movies were effective and even kept Tolkien readers in suspense . But the battle of Helm's Deep and the luminous arrival of Gandalf , Eomer, and the Rohirrim was a breathtaking scene. The camera angles and movements rendered this massive battle sequence gritty and real yet sublimely surreal. Watch the Rohirrim charging down the mountainside and notice the way the cameras are seeing the action. Helm's Deep rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this wont be a unique comment on the movie. I liked the first one, it was giving a great picture of Tolkiens world. At least to me it was as if Peter Jackson had copied the fantasies I had about the surroundings, the characters etc. Sure, I missed Tom Bombadill, and I missed out on some of the things that wasnt there, but atleast there wasnt really anything added (except the fact that Arwen rescues Frodo instead of Glorfindel, but that was something I could live with.) So ofcourse my expectations were high when I went to see TTT, and yes, the MOVIE was as good as the first one, but the story according to the book was lousy. I can live with the fact that they had to exclude some parts of the book that were too hard to use in amovie, but what I dont like is that they've added alot of scenes that was totally inadequate, such as, why did the elves go to Helms Hold? Why did Faramir bring Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath? Why didnt we get to meet the female spider-monster in the end? Why? Why? Why? There are also some general flaws, such as the fact that Legolas refuses to use a saddle...Altogether its a great movie, but lousy compared to the first one, it doesnt give me the same feeling of well-being as FOTR did. I really do hope they dont screw up the third one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most INTENSE movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are new standards of cinematography, artistic settings, and action for the movie making industry. Never before has any movie brought to the screen so visually the horrors of war and the complexity and depth of battle, with the seemingly hopeless courage of the outnumbered few. And yet fine details in settings and storyline were not lost amidst the ferocity of combat. The battle at Helm's Deep is one of the greatest achievements of all time and will be remembered as the definition of medieval war.This movie from the opening scenes with Gandalf fighting the Balrog to the final scenes is captivating to the extreme, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, even if I had read the books at least 25 times and knew what was to happen next. The movie flowed seamlessly from one storyline to another.Something needs to be said about the performance of Andy Serkis as Gollum. He was absolutely incredible in bringing Gollum to life as a real complex being with a dual personality. His performance should earn an oscar, but we all know that personalities and favoritism govern the choosing of oscars, not competence. Witness the choosing last year of "A Beautiful Mind" over "The Fellowship of the Ring" as best movie of the year. This was a sympathy award to Ron Howard because he never earned an oscar before. Perhaps the IMDb should start presenting awards based on the voting of participants. Then we would see awards based on actual best performances and no more sympathy awards.No other movie comes close to the greatness of "The Two Towers" except of course "The Fellowship of the Ring" which itself was among the greatest of all time, but to me is only a sneak preview of what was to come. (After the "Return of the King" is released, I may feel the same way about "The Two Towers"!) For now, "The Two Towers" is my favorite movie of all time deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never in my lifetime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when I was 7 years old. I was a bright kid and though it was a long, laggy story, I was fascinated by everything especially Gandalf, Balrog and Strider. It was this whole new world that opened up to me and I was completely swept away with it.Three years later I read Two Towers and it captivated me even more. By this time I had been playing AD&amp;D and fantasy was my best friend. It was an escapist idea and back then things weren't nearly as bad as they are now but I loved going on that adventure. I also found out that this story was a trilogy and so read Return of the King shortly thereafter. In the 20+ years since I actually finsihed all 3 books for the first time, I have gone back and revisited Middle Earth 9 times.Tolkien, though wordy, was an extremely brilliant writer. The research alone that he brough to these books is astounding. Not to mention creating multitudes of different civilizations, cultures and languages. It is amazing when you sit back and look it from a scholarly point of view.Now that film is where we find the epics of today, not so much in books, it was only a matter of time before some attempted to transform this story for the screen. Ralph Bakshi is often criticized harshly for his rendering of the masterpiece, but I think that's wrong. Bakshi is a master animator and has made several amazing films. He wanted to make three 2 hour movies for each book, but lost studio backing when it was barely halfway finished.Finally the technology and mentality has come to allow us a brilliant view of this incredible story. Thankfully Peter Jackson was as enamored with these books as the regular fan and he has done the story justice. Sure there are obvious changes to the story and some don't make sense but I'm tired of all these people moaning and griping over the tidbits. Sit back, take a deep breath and just look at what Jackson has accomplished. Certainly I never anticipated this trilogy would be made in my lifetime.Thank you to the cast, the crew and exspecially to Peter Jackson for his fascination with the story and desire to make it. I know that Return of the King is going to be just amazing and profound as the first two and the Battle of Pelennor Field and stand at Morannon will be astounding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The well-awaited sequel to the original has come and doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up. "The Two Towers" picks up where "The Fellowship" left off and the second chapter hardly miss a walloping beat.Most of the cast returns here with the additions of Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, and a very slimy Brad Dourif who appear here.The remaining members of "The Fellowship" have taken different paths since the first one ended and the encounters here are even more hair-raising. Frodo and Sam are heading to Mordor with assistance of the (psychologically and physically warped) creature Gollum while Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas are searching for Merry and Pippin, who were abducted and wind up running into a few surprises - one being Gandalf, who appears here as "Gandalf the White" instead of Grey and the other is what happened in Rohan.There's even one subplot where Aragorn (Mortenson) himself is now attracted to a king's daughter (Otto) while he still has the affection for Arwen (Liv Tyler). In a lesser movie, it might be a distraction, but here, it's not.Like the original, the battle scenes are frightening especially of the last ones that takes a half an hour. That fierce battle reminded of a quote from "Platoon" where a soldier says "The beast is out there and he's hungry tonight." and to me, the fight is like "Platoon" with swords and axes instead of guns and gernades."The Two Towers" is strong all-around as the first one was, but since it's the middle chapter. The energy isn't as high here, however; it makes up with the intensity. And maybe this time, the movie might get "Best Picture" at the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quest of accomplishing the impossible continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reader amazed by J.R.R.Tolkien's world might say that 'The Fellowship of the Ring' makes justice to the book. Not all such readers would agree, but in my opinion, 'The Two Towers' makes something more. The first film had just to visualize the story from the first book with minor changes. The second one had to give the story a new and clearly defined structure. This task was almost perfectly accomplished. Also, it is a delight to see TT being different from FOTR. The first film often reminds of a colourful fairy-tale. The second one is more like a historical movie. Realism of one of the main storylines makes such movies like 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart' look a bit like a fantasy. Of course, there are amiable fairy-tale like moments, but character development and action are primary elements. These are perfectly balanced. There is more character development than in the book, and the performance from the actors adds a lot to it. Aragorn is perfectly depicted as firmly stepping towards his kingship. There are all aspects of Frodo's psychology, what makes me to abandon all fears about the ability of the third film to express the darkest ones. Gollum, based on astonishing performance, is alive. His big eyes make him similar to Frodo, a nice visualization of a not too explicit writer's idea. The action, especially the battle, is as capturing as 'The Matrix', while avoiding trivialization of death, so common in the movies.The film is impressive on all levels. There is a digital army, which does not look as such, and there are lots of subtle details like a flag of Rohan landing under the feet of Aragorn's horse. Visual effects? There were two or three. Everything else was REAL. The cinematography is breath - catching. The score is amazing. A certain theme is enough to remind a viewer of a location or event without naming them.What could one expect after FOTR and TT? The 'Return of the King' most likely will complete the seemingly impossible quest of moviemaking. 'The Lord of the Rings' as a whole will certainly be one of the best films ever made. For many people, at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not saying it's this year's Best Picture, but I did enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Tolkien's writing, and I've read the Silmarrilion quite a few times, so I think I'm familiar enough with the story, and I still enjoyed TTT. So maybe they took out some things, it didn't really bother me because I know they will be in ROTK. They added some things, which they do in EVERY book to movie adaption; I didn't hear Harry Potter fans complaining if they added or took things out of the movie. No movie exactly replicates the book it got its idea from, and thats what it is, an IDEA. I'm not saying its this year's Best Picture, but I did enjoy it. The only thing I will complain about is Arwen's role. In the book, she has no speaking part, and in this movie her role is so overdone. But thats about it.Oh yeah, and I didn't hear you all complaining when they took about four chapters out of FOTR. If you have such a problem with this, don't go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually it was as I expected. I had heard that there would be more action in this movie, so I did believe, that if all was done well, I would enjoy it. If I look at both movies, I notice that there isn't much of a change in the actual movies, but in the action. The Fellowship of the Ring didn't achieve to amaze me. It was poorly made, without any real action, without any real feelings and without any real characters. All that was interesting was the ring, but the ring can't keep on its own the whole movie. Special effects...well, I consider they are quite enchanting, but not as enchanting as they should have been. I'll get back to these a little bit later.SPOILERSThe Two Towers is the long awaited sequel to the widely praised Fellowship of the Ring. If you read my review to that movie, which is a little bit harsh, then you will know that I did not appreciate the first movie. What makes me like this movie is the action. nothing else. I personally consider it an action movie, with a little bit of adventure. The amazing battles make up for the quite pathetic sentimental scenes. The scenes that ruined the first movie. The actors are incapable to get real feelings into the movie, so I remained kind of cold to all the dead after which they "weeped".The characters do not change...except Gandalf. I did not totally understand the change that took place in him, but I guess that is because I haven't read the books. Still, this is a minus point. What really makes me laugh...well, this is regarding to the best movies of the year poll. Not the fact that LoTR is at the top. That was what I expected. What I find hilarious is that Liv Tyler actually has a place in th category of supporting actresses. She barely appeared 15 minutes during the whole movie, but still she's there. This is just one of the things which prove to me how superficial such polls are. Not to mention how LoTR appears at sections such as "Best Documentary"... There is this interesting creature Gollum. Gollum who is the result of what the ring can make of something living. Smeagol is what actually remains of the former self. Smeagol is weak though, and Gollum doesn't have much of a fight to take control. This is how I saw things. There were some who said that Gollum was for LoTR as Dobby was for Harry Potter. I will not deny there aren't any similarities, but I do not think they should be compared. Gollum has a much more important role in LoTR, while Dobby barely appears for some minutes in HP and the Chamber of Secrets. I believe this is a difference which matters. Beside that, the characters definitely aren't the same "inside".I am quite curious which part of the creature will win: Gollum or Smeagol.The story itself is about war...and despite what some might be trying to do, I do not think it is really about the losses that a war brings. King Theodon is the one who says he regrets the losses, but I can barely FEEL him saying it. The battles are quite impressive...The special effects now...well, regarding the battle scenes they are very well done. But then, I didn't feel quite at peace while seeing Pippin and Merry on that big tree. They seemed not to belong to that picture. Probably is the result of unsuccessful effects. That's what I believe... The scene which I liked most was when the dam was destroyed and the water destroyed all that came in its way(except the living trees). It was a beautiful scene...as was the scene of the attack of Gandalf and his reinforcements. Unfortunately that was predictable, and it was a kind of traditional opposition.(light-dark)I guess this movie will get quite a few nominations for the Academy Awards. It is not on my list of possible winners though, despite the fact that I haven't seen movies like "The Pianist", "The Hours" or "About Schmidt" yet. I will say that it is a good movie. Because it is. It is interesting and it keeps you awake, unlike its predecessor. It will take me a lot of time to learn why people loved that movie so much...a lot of time.As a mark...well, it is quite an improvement. I guess it would deserve an 8/10. Despite the not so impressive acting and the unsuccessful sentimentalist scenes...I'll be fair and I'll say it is worth seeing, if you want to see an action movie. Something that isn't too much of a weight for one's intellect. I say this, because I personally didn't find anything that made a deep impression on me, or that made me ponder on its meanings.</fullReview>

Its scenery, characters and plot are woven together to produce a masterpiece, absolutely flawless.You can't do anything but marvel at the scope of the movie- $2 billion well spent. New Line cinema invested in what was a bit of a risk- the company's name and profitability were on the line, but Peter J pulled through and they'll be making movies at New Line for many years to come.

		<fullReview>...not THAT good... It certainly does NOT deserve over eight stars!This film was very nicely done with beautiful sceneries, settings and photographing but did it have anything else? The plot is nothing out of ordinary (which is because of the book), characters are left pretty one dimensional except for Gollum but others are just old-friends with one or two eccentricities. Other thing that explains a bit about the lack of personality of the film is the fact this is a middle-part of a trilogy. Usually these kinds of movies are sort of shifting faces for trilogies , which means that they don't have any great meaning in the story... Don't get me wrong, the movie looked very beautiful and the mass-fights were well produced on the big screen but it was nothing more than an entertain-packed action movie with some very poor humour...Gimli didn't have any other purpose in the movie tha to serve as a atmosphere lightener in contrast to Frodo scenes. Something for the mass audiences , to be blunt. I would rate it five stars out of 10. No more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Epic For Its Own Good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, you have a nearly 3 hour long film that could have easily been half that long, had they trimmed down the overused "sweeping epic countryside scenes" that remind us time and time again that yes - our heroes really ARE out in the middle of nowhere! Seriously, after seeing our 3 protagonists look like dots in a meadow surrounded by mountains for the 17th time, I get the idea that they're on an adventure! Enough already!Just a small quibble.Another issue I had with this film (because at this point enough money/fuss has been made from the LOTR franchise to use the lowly term "movie") was the buildup of the war between the humans and the orcs. You get the idea that this battle is HUGE - because it is for the first 30 seconds. After that it cuts back and forth from Aragorn and Legolas kicking arse to A GIANT FRIGGIN' TREE talking to two HOBBITS. This really hurts the battle scene, because it takes away the focus to place it onto something that smacks a bit of some anti-pollution cartoon from the early 1990's. (Ex: A tree telling children the dangers of pollution.)Once again, a small quibble.Gimli... Now there's a mixed bag if there ever was one. His emotions, great. His animation, great. His voice, great. So, you ask, what's the problem? The problem is that he just seems out of place here. Now, I know he ISN'T because he's an integral part of the series, but the way he's portrayed in the movie just kind of offsets the whole pace and balance of the thing.Once again, a small quibble.Above all else, what irritated me most about this film was the big deal everyone was making over what how great it was. I liked the first one just fine, but after watching this I have to say that it is really, really forgettable. Honestly, there really wasn't that much that stood out. Or PERHAPS ALL of it stood out so much that it kind of cancelled itself out. That's the price you pay for a 3 hour epic of epics.Once again, a small quibble. Of course, all of these small quibbles add up to one BIG quibble - that being "less yackin', more hackin'!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it, this is among the year's best movies. Peter Jackson's direction is superb. The performances are outstanding. The battle scenes are magnificent. And the New Zealand scenery is simply gorgeous (as good as in any movie I've ever seen).Not having read the novels by J.R.R. Tolken, except The Hobbit, I cannot say how faithful the movie is to them. But it seems shorter than its three hours. It NEVER drags.Having three of Jackson's early movies (Bad Taste, Dead Alive, and Meet the Feebles), I can attest that The Lord of the Rings is a significant departure for him. Not only is it his first big-time production, but it is the first serious movie Jackson has made. The others are pure camp. And be forewarned: the earlier Jackson movies are definitely NOT for kids. But for adults, they are great fun.That leads to my final point. The only thing missing from LOTR is Peter Jackson's twisted sense of humor. Perhaps the subject matter does not lend itself to it. But the film could use a bit of comic relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic fantasy/action movie. A great achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first viewing of this movie, i came away from the theatre disappointed. I had just finished re-reading the book and all the characters and events were fresh in my mind. I expected to see on film the exact images i had read on paper. Unfortunately this soured my movie experience and i seemed to spend most of the time looking for all the changes and debating with myself if i agreed or disagreed with them. I guess i fell into the trap and even thou i knew, i did not heed the words 'The Two Towers the Movie - based on the books by Tolkien'.Anyway finally went and watched it again. Sat back, relaxed, cleared my mind and went for a ride. The amazing detail that went into all the scenes is just mind blowing. The battles were fantastic. As an fantasy / action epic this movie gives you everything you would expect and more. The downside is that some of the new characters do not get a chance to develop fully with the exception of Gollum. He was cleverly portrayed and all to entirely believable. There were several scenes that did not feel quite right like at the end with Farimir and Frodo.Overall a highly enjoyable way to past 3 hours. If you like to escape into a fantasy realm you can't go wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some spoilers)I have two words for all of you Tolkien purists who seem to think that Peter Jackson is a disrespectful glory-hungry hack: ADAPTED SCREENPLAY. The Lord of the Rings books are fantasy in its purest form: mystical lands, magical creatures, and dreadful villains. It's not an accident that movies haven't been made depicting the books until now. It would be impossible for Jackson or any other director to just lay the books onto a movie screen. Significant decisions had to be made to make a cinematic version of the story. Don't for a second think that Peter Jackson himself isn't torn up about having to cut out things like Tom Bombadil or moving the trilogy's great siege sequence from Minas Tirith to Helm's Deep. The Two Towers movie does depart from the book in several ways, but I am quite confident that everything will work out after the ROTK movie is released. For those who are dumbfounded that Shelob does not appear in the 2nd movie, shouldn't you be in even greater anticipation that she will appear in the 3rd? Everyone needs to stop crying about how Peter Jackson has ruined the books and should instead takes these films for what makes them so special: unbelievable locations (Edoras? are you serious?), fantastic CG creatures (how sweet are the Ents?), and even an extended love story for the ladies to enjoy. We are lucky to view such an outstanding portrayal of great literature. This is an incredible movie worthy of all accolades, and I can't even imagine how ridiculous the third movie will be. Wow.

		<fullReview>Though part two of the great LotR trilogy did not quite meet the high expectations I had from the first part, "The Fellowship of the Rings", I definitely enjoyed watching it.If there were not "The Fellowship ...", I would rate "The Two Towers" my favorite fantasy movie of all times. Technically, part II is even more impressive than the first, and there are scenes I enjoy watching over and over again, e.g. Gandalf fighting the Balrog, or the Orcs marching against Helm's Deep. However, a good deal of the original story from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel has been abandoned to make room for more "action". E.g. the Ents are hurried over so quickly, that they could have been left off all together. The battle at Helm's Deep ends abruptly (no entish magic involved), and against all odds, etc.But maybe this is the way Peter Jackson had to go - if I want 100% Tolkien, I'm still able to read the books ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can an animated character win best Actor ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I would like to say that I read the book a long time ago but I am not a rabid fan. The odd changes to the story I can live with as books and films are not the same (that is to you fanboys and fangirls).This was an awesome film in every way which got even better the second time I watched it. From the initial sequence right through the climatic scenes this seemed so much more than the first film and I loved that.The thing that struck me the most was Smeagol / Gollum. Not just the CGI that is used to create him (although that is as good as we were led to believe and makes that silly House Elf from the boy wizard film look like Mickey Mouse). It was Andy Serkis - the emotion and torment he filled the character with made me feel for him in much bigger way than I ever did when reading the book. The way the character kept swaying between Gollum and Smeagol kept me hooked to the screen more than any other part of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the ents as I had been worried that these would just look stupid. This gives me hope for the final film and some of the more outlandish characters in that.My only fault, although this is more with the book than the film, is that Frodo and Sam's relationship is a bit too much sometimes - I'm not sure what it is - I can see why their were rumours on the net that the two were homosexual as the book although not saying this gave them a friendship that I cannot imagine outside of a loving intimate one (maybe that is my jaded view of the world though). I have no problems with homosexual relationships on film but this sort of is nearly but not quite there.See this film and then see it again but don't drink lots of soft drink before going in (like I did the first time - doh!) as it's a long film that only bladder will clue you in on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no need for a long essay on this film, all there needs to be is just one word, 'OUTSTANDING!' This film was brilliant, it captured the book itself and portrayed the thrills and excitement, but also, more importantly the inner struggle of Frodo, Sam and the others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply, I can't wait for "The Return of the King". It was a strange feeling seeing "The Two Towers": few days after I saw the first one I red the two books(The Two Towers and The Return of the King) for the first time (until now I never red the first one) so this time was completely different...but again after 3 hours and 15 minutes I was not tired, not boared, just hungry of more story, more fight, more visions...hope there will be a special event somewhere, where will be possible the three movies together, kind of a happening: I'll be there!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first was excellent, the second is a masterpiece. I can't wait for the third. I have already seen this film twice in the cinema and can't wait for the special extended DVD to come out. Although bits of the story are changed for the film, it still works very well. The battle scenes are outstanding and the acting is great. The comic banter with Legolas and Gimli is priceless. Aragorn is a solid dependable character. The portrayal of Gollum is especially well done. Make sure you see the first film before seeing this one or it will be hard to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as mind-numbing as the first, but still an instant classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, it's great. And yeah, I'll see it countless times on DVD, already several times in theatres. There are so many beautiful and powerful images in this movie that it's ridiculous to reel them all off. All in all it's a masterpiece, second act of a whole that will probably stand as the greatest, most fantastic film epic for many, many years to come. And still I can't help being just a tiny little bit disappointed?! Now, how's that for being ungrateful! Two major issues concerning changes from the original story follow below, plus reflections on the difference between being a movie LOTR "virgin" and having a score of FOTR viewings in your backpack when seeing TTT!Well, I have to say I am *really* looking forward to finding out what purpose that whole scene with Frodo showing the One Ring to a Black Rider was about. Doesn't the entire plot evolve around the fact that the Fellowship was supposed to go into Mordor *unnoticed*? I'm waiting for a reason for this scene, and a bit nervous about it, at that.Also, I find the screenplay's approach to the Ent-moot a tad strange: why on earth do the Ents take several days to decide on whether Merry and Pip are who they are, and decide not to fight - and then come storming out of the woods, lined up for battle, immediately after a howl from Treebeard? I guess it was done for dramatic effect, to hold the "non-literary" audience in suspense - but I think it was a rather pointless change from the book, and making no sense in regard to Ent psychology.Some CGI blunders seem as if they are the result of Peter Jackson's five-week award tour in 2002, haste in the editing forcing some irritating errors; there are many, some obvious - just look under Goofs at this page.I must admit to sometimes sighing a bit inwardly, silently wishing for the camera not to flip and flap about so much during (the many) battle sequences, so that one could dwell a bit more on all the details of the combatants. I know there's a perfectly good directing reason for it, showing how the havoc really is havoc, so that's just me.The score: it's great, I play it a lot on my stereo - and it's very much like the first one. Although not as varied, I think. When the three films can be seen in a row it will be very nice with the continuity, I'm sure, but right now it feels too much like the first to get me cheering.These things being said, there is no doubt that the tiny bit of disappointment mostly comes from enormous expectations. FOTR was an incredible blast: I laughed, I cried, I didn't move for three hours, I went to the theatre NINE times, I became a fanclub charter member, I bought both DVD editions. I mean, you can't have that same new feeling to it when you see TTT, or any other movie - because now you *know* how the orcs look like, how Saruman looks like etc. Of course, everything is still visually magnificent in TTT, I'm just saying - NOTHING can surpass, for me, the very first viewing at the premiere of FOTR in December 2001, because that was witnessing a new film legend.The Two Towers is a wonderful movie, I love it in spite of the minor flaws I see in it, and it's a definite 10 out of 10 stars from this reviewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second installment of Lord of the rings - Two Towers-is a very good made film. But nothing special in it, absolutely!!!!!!!! I liked "The Fellowship of ring" very much. And then i first saw comments here at imdb.com about 2-nd part i was very exiting of course.Now i saw it.But it is not better than the first part. I think it little worse. Not breathtaking for sure. There were so much words about Gollum. And yes, i think he is the best thing in a film. As for cg character he is very good, but nothing revolutionary after Atack of the clones. He maybe looks more detail than Yoda, but not so much better. I was going to see something realy staggering new in technologies of cg, but i didn't. He was a little better made than yoda or dobby but that's all. Anyway his character was best part of the film. All in all film is ok, but no magic of first part. A lot of parts are dull and a lot are fun. I like alive trees very much. The final battle was the thing which i did not like very much. I saw such things hundred times in different historical films - siege of the fortress and e.t.c. No fantasy atmosphere in it. Remember - Evil dead 3 - Army of darkness. The siege of fortress in army of darkness was realy fun, and here in Two Towers it is not. All special effects in general give us nothing new. I saw it all in 1-st part. Only Gollum is made better in the second. It is just a tendency now to speak about this film in such a big enthusiasm. But it is just good.............</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quest continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enhancement (30 December 2012) Since posting the original review (see below), I had acquired the extended DVD of the trilogy which, for EACH of the three movies, provided an extended version of the movie that is around 4 hours, as well as a few hours of background material covering just about everything you would like to know about the making of the trilogy. I have since viewed this set of extended DVD a few times and, based on these viewings, posted an IMDb review under "The return of the King on 13 January 2005. But I never looked back at my TTT review until now and I feel that a few more words are warranted. In my original review, I made a comment to the effect that in covering three separate but parallel main story lines, TTT comes across as somewhat fragmented (see original review below). That was based on the first impression watching the cinema version. I've since changed my mind after watching the Extended DVD and, even more importantly, the documentary appendix where Peter Jackson and the editing crew talk about the process of editing the film. The three parallel lines are each given considerable length at the beginning to let the audience move along comfortably with the stories. Then the pace quickens, with more and more frequent cross-cutting, until in the end the separately climax in blood-boiling action: Aragon, Legolas and Gimli charged out from Helms Deep with Theoden, to be greeted by Gandolf up on the gap with the glow of dawn behind his back, then charging down in full ferocity with Eomer and the reinforcement; Pippin and Merry, finally succeeded in arousing Treebeard and company, witnessed the devastating attack of Isengard; in Osgiliath, the blood-cuddling descend Nazguls finally made Faramir understand the meaning of the quest of Frodo and Sam, and release them to follow Gollum into Mordor.Original review posted on 4 February 2003:This is comparing TTT with Fellowship. These two are by far the best in their genre that no comparison with any other movies in this genre is even meaningful.The first reason why Towers is just slightly satisfying is the Shire, or absence of it, rather. While the grandeur of the dwarfs' caves and the bewitching charm of the elves' forests equally excite and delight me, the real magic of LOTR is rooted in the humble, simple, but most comfortable dwellings of the hobbits in the Shire, just as the ultimate strength of the fellowship of the ring is rooted in the simple, fun-loving but resilient and enduring hobbits. Therefore, while the entire movie of Fellowship is immensely satisfying, it's the very first part, when Gandalf was coming to the Shire, that I best love. And I miss it a little in Towers.The other reason has to do with the difficulty of making the book into a movie. In the trilogy, each of the three volumes is sub-divided into two books. In Fellowship, the movie pretty well follows the book in a single, linear progression. In Towers, book 3 deals with what happens in Rohan while book 4 tells the story of Frodo and Sam going into Mordor. Within book 3, the chapters alternative between the stories of Aragon's trio and the two hobbits. Obviously, it wouldn't do to follow the structure of the book in making the movie, devoting the entire first half to Rohan and the second half to Mordor. The director and film editor have done their best however the movie came across as slightly too fragmented.These two reasons are really personal, and not flaws of the movie.Finally, just a few comments on the characters:- Glad to see that Aragon is gradually coming into his own, becoming more and more like a king, the way it should be- Gollum is a masterpiece, the closest to the original among all the characters- Treebeard is a bit of a disappointment, but it is also the most difficult, if not outright impossible, to create on screen (to faithfully reproduce his speeches in full length on screen will probably drive away even the most loyal audience, but without this aspect, it's really not the Treebeard that we know)- Eowyn is beautifully played, as is Faramir- In the Middle Earth in my own mind, Theoden is older and thinner; but I gladly accept the movie version- Similarly, I cannot expect Legolas and Gimli to be like the ones who have lived in my Middle Earth for over 30 years; but I like the movie version too- Gandalf's character takes on many different shades; the one I love most is when he was going into the Shire, at the very beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can it get better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought a fantasy movie could achieve greatness after Star Wars (although Star Wars has his percentage of science-fiction, it still is a fantasy movie) but Peter Jackson seems to want me proven wrong. And he accomplished it. The Fellowship Of The Ring came pretty close to the top and The Matrix still has to pass the test of having a capable sequel, but The Two Towers can easilly be already acclaimed the best fantasy movie ever - at least until the release of Star Wars Episode III. If you are one of those die-hard book fans who can't stand when the wrong character says that favourite line of yours then you shouldn't watch this movie hoping that it is a perfect adaptation of the book. It isn't. It is based on the book, which is a great masterpiece in literature, but it can make it better and come to life. Viggo Mortensen does a great job with Aragorn and Ian McKellen is... well... Ian McKellen but the greatest of all actors in this movie is a CG character named Sméagol, or Gollum. This movie is worth paying the ticket just for watching Gollum come to life. Absolutely amazing work. If you think the CG characters in some popular movies like Star Wars or Spiderman looked real that is because you haven't seen Gollum yet. Gollum is the best actor in this movie and if it wasn't for being a CG creation then I would say give him the Oscar right away. Of course if the Academy Awards go on with the pathetic decisions they made last year The Two Towers will probably win nothing but technical awards. Go watch The Two Towers, go watch it again, and again. I'm sad that there isn't an 11 in IMDB's rating scale because this is the best fantasy movie ever. No doubts. It is fantastic, it is epic - and the soundtrack is brilliant -, it is beautiful. It is... precious. The wait for The Return Of The King is unbearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, although the first film was good... it made me yawn more than once, it was almost 100% faithful to the book with minor twists that made it more watchable.the second BOOK I´ve never been too much of a fan of because of the adventures of frodo and sam are for the most part boring and uneventful. the second MOVIE had to make due with showing that they were still alive whilst still cutting to the battle sequences that make more fun. this would have been extrememly boring had it not been for the character of gollum which is the only part that makes these scenes bareable, the characters of frodo and sam seem washed out in comparison.all in all this film entertained me completely, treebeard and gollum are so impressively well done that I almost couldn´t tell they were fake, some scenes look a bit fake, especially the flyovers of helm´s deep before thebattle, but all in all it´s a small price to pay.the only real thing I didn´t like about the film was how it jumped all over the place, but then I don´t think I would have been able to stay awake with the narrative sticking to the book´s original layout so this was a small price to pay, a masterwork, can´t wait to see #3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but I expect the 3rd film to be the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Fellowship was better than TTT. And having read the books, I feel the third book will make the best transition to film, so I can't wait to see ROTK. It should be the best movie of all 3. I would have liked this movie to end as it did in the book, on a cliffhanger to add even more suspense. I thought the addition of Frodo's encounter with the Nazgul was a good idea because it helped show how Frodo was slowly falling victim to the ring. But, like many others, I didn't like Aragorn's supposed death and dream sequence with Arwen. That was an unnecessary addition. Of course, other changes were made from the book, such as the elves at Helms Deep and the way Treebeard and the Ents decided to bring down Isengard. And Faramir's character was totally distorted from the book. They should have not done this because he was not as seduced by the power of the ring as his brother was.The cgi effects were awesome. Gollum and his interactions with real people were realistic. And I liked the way the Ents looked. The beasts(not sure what they are) but looked like warthogs on roids were the only really fake looking special effects. And as I recall in the book it talks of Gandalf fighting the balrog in the caves as an entensive battle. It would have been nice for the movie to have shown the battle in the caves more.FINAL VERDICT: I liked it a lot. But, the first film and I expect the last one will be better. Definitely a must see for all who like fantasy/adventure/sci-fi movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But not quite a story-telling one.I enjoyed this movie immensely, but the plot changes went very close to ruining it for me. I understand now that this is no longer Tolkien's Middle Earth, but Peter Jackson's.Naturally all book to movie conversions require some very necessary alterations and omissions. But I think Peter Jackson has taken a bit too much "creative liberty" with the story (and characters), in many ways transforming them to be unrecognisable from how they were originally.For a true LoTR and Tolkien fan to enjoy these movies, you have to keep them very separate from the books. They are a retelling of the story rather than a faithful rendition, using the original story more or less as a guideline only.So now let me comment on the movie for what it is, not on how it compares to the book.The scope of this movie moves up a notch from the original, to do for Middle Earth what Episode II did for that galaxy far far away. It didn't seem there was a lot of time for character development, but there's really too much going on at all times for that to be feasible in any case. In many ways, the story gets tucked away, and we instead get sweeping cinematography shot followed by big battle scene followed by more cinematography. Dialogue and convoluted plot elements were greatly simplified; some worked, and some did not.The fall to death and later miraculous reappearance of Aaragorn was a poor addition to the plot, since that's the exact thing that already happened to Gandalf. The expansion of Arwen's role again stole screen time that could have been put to much better use. Perhaps it's just there to give the female viewers something to feel is just for them.The performances were largely good. Tyler and Blanchett still seem like miscasts, and Wood's acting is starting to bring the movies down for me. He's too simplistic and naive and child-like and his cockney-like fake English accent is even more annoying than in the first film.Thankfully, that's really the extent of the bad acting. Excellent performances again from Astin, Mortensen, McKellen, Weaving and Rhys Davies. And even Orlando Bloom, girl bait though he is, seems to have taken some acting lessons since the first film where his performance was very weak. Miranda Otto as Eowyn was perfect, and Brad Dourif gave a very solid performance as Wormtongue in what was sadly a reduced role.A real stand-out was the CGI performance of Gollum, largely "acted" by Serkis himself. I believed Yoda's characterisation was just as good, but that was a much smaller role and didn't have nearly so much performance as demanded by Gollum in this film. It was convincing and very well done. Faramir, Merry, Pippin and the rest of the supporting cast were sound but otherwise unremarkable.Finally, to the things I loved about the movie. Gollum's argument with Smeagol was a nice, and humourous touch. Gimli the comic relief may have hurt diehard fans of the dwarf, but you can't deny it was hilarious most of the time. The Ents marching on Isenguard was amazing. The Oliphants looked impressive, but the Wargs weren't quite as good. The battles were huge, but they happened at night so it was very hard to see what was going on at times.As long as these movies are, you don't want them to end (unless you are busting to go to the toilet) and that's when you know what you are watching is special. This can hurt replay value though, because repeated viewings of a movie this long will find you impatiently sitting through the boring parts waiting for your favourite scenes again. But that's no real criticism.Overall, better than the first film and setting things up nicely for the third, The Two Towers is a spectacular cinema and movie experience.</fullReview>

It was convincing and very well done. Faramir, Merry, Pippin and the rest of the supporting cast were sound but otherwise unremarkable.Finally, to the things I loved about the movie. Gollum's argument with Smeagol was a nice, and humourous touch. Gimli the comic relief may have hurt diehard fans of the dwarf, but you can't deny it was hilarious most of the time. The Ents marching on Isenguard was amazing. The Oliphants looked impressive, but the Wargs weren't quite as good. The battles were huge, but they happened at night so it was very hard to see what was going on at times.As long as these movies are, you don't want them to end (unless you are busting to go to the toilet) and that's when you know what you are watching is special. This can hurt replay value though, because repeated viewings of a movie this long will find you impatiently sitting through the boring parts waiting for your favourite scenes again. But that's no real criticism.Overall, better than the first film and setting things up nicely for the third, The Two Towers is a spectacular cinema and movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was one of the best films I have ever seen. It had a much better ending than the first one, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, did. I really loved the battle scenes. One of the best battles I've seen since Braveheart. Those tree people were the best ever! I loved, absolutly loved the visual effects. The best effects of the year! It deserves the Oscar for it. Also, I think that Peter Jackson did a fantastic job directing it. I would advise everybody to go out and see this, it's one of the greatest films ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a magnificent film that will leave you both incredibly satisfied, and wanting more. Being the sequel to the first film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship fo the Ring, TTT simply hurtles you straight back into the World of Middle Earth, with no prologue to help the ME ignorant. TTT is a masterpiece, and better than FOTR (if you believe that to be possible). Using brilliant acting, captivating dialogue, a moving score, breathtaking visual effects, and a fool-proof plot, TTT is a film that can't fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two towers is the shorter book of the trilogy. However it started in the fourth page and finish at the middle of the book. Three hour for 150 pages it's too long. Also the second book is a too free version of Tolkien novel, especially if it's compare with the first one. The second also have the same trouble than the first one (the older characters like Arwen, Legolas or Frodo are portray by very young actors while the younger like Eowyn or Pippin are very old: that remain the golden period of Hollywood like Little Women 1949 or Romeo and Julliet 1936). Also some important figures of the Novel like the very Cool Pippin or Farimir are reduce too mere figures decorative. The other big mistake is too killing an Elf. In the trilogy none of the elf dies- However this movie is much personal and have a nice love triangle between 70 Aragorn, 2500 Arwen and 22 Eowyn. Aragorn and Arwen love scenes are really beautiful and passionate. The Helm Abysm fight scene is one of the most gorgeous battles of cinema history. And the visual effects are much better than the first one. Even when is easy too distinguish a natural scene than aThis movie had four things that I like very much: the love triangle, the Helm Abysm and too digital characters: The treebeard Ent (voice by Rhys Davies) and specially Gollum. Gollum ?Smeagol choice of being a good or bad hobbit is the best performance I'have seen in a long time. Sometimes evil some times sweet, Peter Weir and actor Andy Serkis creates a very seducer creature, who robbed the heart and the applause from the audience. To conclude is maybe too long but fortunately is also very different from the first one, so in possible than the Return of the King will be the best of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' turns out to be a mighty impressive second installment in the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy ? and this from someone who wasn't exactly the greatest fan of the first installment, `Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.' That film, for all its visual splendor, narrative ambition and epic scope, ultimately, turned into little more than a conventional monster movie, with the characters battling one strange creature after another to the point where the film finally became a crashing bore long before its three-hour running time was up. `The Two Towers,' though equally long (one minute shy of three hours, to be exact), doesn't fall into this monotonous narrative pattern, thereby allowing for more variety in its story and more depth in its characterizations.As someone who knows next to nothing about the specifics of the trilogy, I must say that the story can be a bit hard to follow for the non-initiate. We aren't always sure who is who or just how the battle lines in the various good-vs.-evil conflicts fall out. This has the unfortunate effect of making the early stretches of the film confusing and, at times, downright incomprehensible. Luckily, the plot strands begin to straighten themselves out after not too long a time, and one can at least follow the unfolding action well enough to become absorbed in the spectacle on screen. And impressive that spectacle is, with director Peter Jackson once again creating an entire fantasy world with the help of his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, as well as his various art directors, scenic designers and special effects wizards.One of the reasons `The Two Towers' triumphs over `Fellowship of the Ring' is that this newest film provides us with more conflicted, more complex characters. This is especially true in the case of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who's been entrusted with the powerful ring, but who must now struggle to avoid becoming taken over by its evil power. Similarly, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process. These two characters bring some added depth to all the surface magnificence of eye-filling vistas and heart-pounding adventure and battle scenes.Not being familiar with Tolkien's novels, I cannot say to what extent the film is or is not faithful to the original. I will, therefore, simply state that `The Two Towers' is a powerful and moving saga that can stand on its own as a first-rate movie-going experience. Having nodded through the first installment of the series, I was not exactly looking forward to Part Two. Now, having seen Part Two, I can't wait to see Part Three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second part of what has been a life changing piece of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both the books which we have finally read, and the movie trilogy have been inspirational to our family even more than they have been dramatic events. We are deeply impressed both with Tolkien's world view, and with the dedication Peter Jackson showed in his treatment of the Rings. For both movies we have been amazed at how quickly the nearly three hours passes while we are engrossed in the films. Although our children are only nine and eleven, we believed that the depictions of good and evil, and the representation of sacrificial courage were sufficiently important to allow them to see the films in all their rawness. They have also been a wonderful and effective antidote to the Harry Potter series.Our only problem, having seen the first two films and expecting the same of the third, is that most everything else pales in comparison. They certainly make one hunger for content in films that has generally been absent, or is so perverse as to seriously affect one's sense of worth and well-being. These are highly prized parts of our entertainment life and they have touched us at our core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can be said about this fairy-story for adults? Boromir and Frodo are two diminutive human-like creatures (hobbits) from a threatened region of fantasy world. They have been entrusted to return an evil ?ring of power' to its source and so destroy it. The Ring has a mind and personality of its own and tries to corrupt its bearer. Line up the good guys: Gandalf, (friendly magician), The Ents (tree-creatures that can walk and talk), various human and half-human species, and CGIs that generally are wont to inhabit such tales. Then there's the baddies: Saruman (corrupt wizard), the Dark Lord Sauron, and an army of custom-bred nasties (queue more fabulous CGIs). Finally, one of the most popular characters, Gollum (Smeagal) who has been twisted body and soul and tracks after the ring bearer in the belief he is its rightful owner. (Smeagal is such a remarkable feat of special effects that he has endeared himself to many audiences who come out pining for a pet one.) The ?Two Towers' of evil unite against the forces of good and slug it out for another three hours. (This synopsis for the benefit of anyone who hasn't spent many hours reading the book). The good things about the film are much the same as Part One (Fellowship of the Ring) or even better ? great scenery, great battles, believable acting and judicious use of special effects in a movie that respects the intelligence of the adult cinema-goer without being too horrific for a young adolescent. On the down side, you have to like this sort of stuff in the first place, or be willing to be won over, and you have to put up with built in flaws like a dodgy and seemingly random mix of accents throughout. Part two of a remarkable, brilliant, and genre-making trilogy ? but more or less what you would expect if you've seen part one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is possibly one of the greatest epic's ever made. Surpassing another recent blockbuster 'Gladiator' in almost every way. The mood is as dark as you could possibly get, the foreboding of the oncoming battle gradually encompasses you so when the first volley of arrows comes you feel them whistling past your ears. From the perspective of being in the centre of this titanic clash of good vs evil it is hard not to want to charge at the screen swinging Anduril.Other great things about this film: Sam, Gollum, Frodo, Elven archers, Mumakil, Orc Captains, Shadowfax, Legolas, dead marshes, orc riders etc etc.If you haven't seen it ten times already, WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you a story my best friend went to see it before me and I was planning to go a week later, only thing she told me that I hated the most was that one of the main characters was going to die. She told me that Legolas was going to die. Man through out the whole movie I was annoying my bf, when he will die. I guessed each scene, which one, but at the end it turns out that he doesn't die. I was so mad at her.I admit that there is one thing I hated the most about this movie, when Pippin and Merry spend the whole time talking to trees, what is up with that I mean they didn't do much they just stuck to walking with trees, and not until the end do they get to do something, but they really didn't do anything, because it was the trees who did something. I like Viggo Mortensen's (Aragon) work, just knowing that he does his own stunts, makes me appreciate, the work he did for it. I like a man that shows not to worried about scrapping himself when he is gorgeus. We need more actors like him. Orlando Bloom (Legolas), didn't do his own stunts, in the first movie, but my friend told me he did in the second one, which if he did man was he good, I loved the way alot of stunts did, because it shows alot of courage, for a young guy like him.As for Elijah Wood(Frodo), just watching him try to fight the evil from himself makes it so woderful to watch. Especially that he has those powerful blue eyes that makes him more spookier everytime that there is an evilness stirring inside of him. As for Andy Serkins, he does so great the voice for Golum, he makes him look funny and good and bad in different ways, it is awesome. He was worth seeing in the whole movie. Well if you haven't seen it yet please do it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have plenty of special effects, various battles against the evil's troops, most of them non humans and really nasty creatures, so more action and less thinking in the film. Obviously, this is part of a whole story, but if you compare this film with the first part you will agree with the fact that the first one had more content for thinking and/or meditation. One thing was clear to me and this was the message of peace given by the film and against those emperors always creating troubles, sometimes false ones, for provoking the wars. This happened during the Middle age, so let's hope that these events do not repeat at present in our planet Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally! Part II of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is upon us. And it was well worth the wait.That pretty much sums it all up... but considering you're all b*****ds who want me to waste a few more precious minutes of my life sputtering out synonyms for "awesome" and "pee-your-pants-goodness", well, here goes.The Two Towers is almost everything it should be. It continues the story of the ring bearer, Mr. Frodo, his amigo in action, Samwise the Brave, and their new accomplice in sneaking into Molten Lava Land, Gollum/Smeagol. That last one being two personages in one body for the most part... And 100% CGI. Now, before you jump on Peter Jackson's back like a drugged-up howler monkey that's high on the smack, let me just tell you that there was no other possible way to create Gollum/Smeagol without computer use. No way. And, after the initial sight of him, you truly begin to believe that he is a real, big-eyed, schizophrenic mess of a thing who's interacting with his fellow halflings in all the scenes that they share. Honestly, Gollum/Smeagol is the best character in this episode. I wouldn't shit you about that. Lord knows I hate crappy CGI more than Mulder. I thought that I would have been the first to lambaste and charbroil Jackson's attempt to make us feel sorry for a bunch of moving pixels, but by gum, he made it work!The Two Towers is also about Merry and Pippin and their escape from their Orcish imprisonment (that was set up at the end of the first film, The Fellowship of the Ring). We see how they bust loose and meet up with the oldest living creature in all of Middle Earth, Treebeard. He's an Ent. That means that he's a tree herder. If you have to ask any more about that then these movies aren't meant for you. Go see Harry Potter again, dweeb.Anyway, The Two Towers is also more about the re-meetings of Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn and their once dead, wise wizard friend, Gandalf. And yes, for all you dickweeds out there who couldn't follow plot points if they were tattooed backwards on you forehead (so that you could see and read them when you looked in a mirror, ass), Gandalf the Grey DID die while fighting the Balrog of Moria. Then he was sent back by the powers in the West to complete his mission as Gandalf the White. C'mon! This isn't half as confusing as all that time ripple effect in Back to the Future II. Stay with me here.Soon we also meet lots of secondary characters, including: Éowyn, Théoden, Éomer, Gríma Wormtongue, Faramir and a lot more characters whose names sound funny to stupid people. Stop giggling! This is serious stuff! Rohan and Gondor get their asses handed to them by the dark empire known as Mordor, Gollum/Smeagol literally wrestles with his other self in order to save/kill Master Frodo. Yessssss.... Then they would have precious... Then THEY would be master... Yessssssss.Grima tries to seduce both Théoden and Éowyn (for different reasons I'm guessing, but can't really be sure. He could actually be trying to get them both in the sack for Saruman's sake), Helm's Deep is sacked and raped like Mike Tyson's last beauty-pageant date, and Faramir is heavily tempted by the one ring. All bad stuff... trust me.Now to nitpick. I said before that The Two Towers is almost everything that it should be. Let me explain. Peter Jackson apparently thought that J.R.R. Tolkien's original text was lacking. He thought that there were serious lack-of-humor problems, so he made the noble dwarf, Gimli, the comic reli ef of this movie. He thought that having other wise and brave people in Middle Earth other than our original fellowship was silly, so he made the rest of the kings and noblemen retarded and hardheaded. Plus he ended the film before we even get to see Shelob, the giant spider-demon thingy. I just wanted to see her, is that so wrong? But all in all these are just minor bitchings. The special effects may seem a bit rougher around the edges than the first film, but they're still amazing in lots of scenes. The whole tone may seem a bit more drab and lifeless, but that's mostly due to the settings (mostly rocky and craggy brown landscapes). And the biggest problem with this movie is that it ends. All I want now is to see the final battle in The Return of the King. Next December seems soooooo far away. But when it gets here, I just know it'll be very precious (yes, I know that the whole "precious" thing has gotten old already, but it's all I got!).So, what did I think of The Two Towers? I liked it alot. It could have gotten a full five, but for those itty bitty quibbles I mentioned above. But other than me, what's really perfect in this world anyway?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first installment of the Lord of the rings trilogy was released you instantly realised that this trilogy was going to be a landpost in modern filmaking. The two towers is an absolutely fantastic film, the story allready made and one of the most loved works of fiction of all times makes it hard not to like the film aswell.Tolkien created a work of genius and jackson and his crew has done an fantastic job of adding and expanding to that work of genius. So well done are many of the aspects of the film that it must also be considered a work of genius. The film is dramatically different from the Fellowship of the ring. Where the Fellowship was a film of many peaks and lows the two towers brings one long builup to its immense climaxes of the battle of helms deep and the fall of sauruman.This in one way make the two towers a more enjoyable movie as you feel a constant exitment as to "what is to come". When the end comes it simply takes your breath away. The CG is brilliantly done and gollum surpassed my expectations by a mile. Treebeard is brilliantly done also. Alltho i missed Quickbeem, you got to accept that some caracter has to be lost in the movie adaptation.The fans who have read the books seem also to be delighted with the movie adaptation. I am one of the many who has the read the books, and im hugely impressed with what jackson has managed to pull of. One character i felt was short of the books is Faramir. The Changes they made to him and the ring at that stage is something i feel underminds Faramir's nobility and strength. As we know Faramir lets frodo go at his own will after a long talk with him. I totally understand Jackson's motivations for choosing to change this part as it would slow the movie down.Overall the movie surpassed my expectations, even after watching the The fellowship. So its a clear cut 10/10 in my oppinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, the best film of the year won't get the recognition it deserves. This just proves that Oscar voters will most likely forget about an incredible film that serves as more than just a transition to the ultimate chapter. From the first shot of the film to the very last, the artistry and proficiency in this film showed more than Fellowship of the Ring. But like its previous film, it will be forgotten because it is just too grand and beautiful for anyone to comprehend. It just goes to show that some people have all the luck. Peter Jackson doesn't need to make anymore films in his life because these ones will be his lasting legacy. TTT was also much more bearable to watch. The three-hour run time isn't as severe as the first film, considering the pacing and the editing is much more polished and succinct. I will remove myself from rating this as the best in the series, merely because I have yet to see the remaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the "Fellowship Of The Ring" and I still do, but I think that "The Two Towers" was far and away better than the first. One of the better additions into this film was Gollum, who despite the fact that the audience is meant to hate him, was just cool. Miranda Otto did a good job of Eowyn, even though she was not in it for too long, and I liked that we saw more of Gimli. "The Two Towers" offered more impactive and impressive scenes, such as the Black Gate Of Mordor, and the battle at Helm's Deep. I strongly recommend you see this, but see the Fellowship first (if you haven't already) as there is no bit at the beginning to fill you in. Great Movie, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too shabby, from a "Newbie's" point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, nor have I read the Hobbit. However, I am still able to follow (somewhat) the plot outline of TTT and its predescessor, The Fellowship of the Rings. Still, I did not like this movie as much as the one before it. It seemed to be slower, and the Hobbits, who, as I understand, are supposed to be more of the lead characters, are largely ignored as the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas (-swoons!-), and Gimli are followed.I think that Smeagol/Gollum was done pretty well, but to a newbie like me, much of his turmoil and incentives fail to make much sense, rather than to get some laughs from the audience.The battle scenes are pretty nice, with good special effects, but much of it is hard to follow because of the whiplash speeds the camera changes when going from shot to shot. Some humor is put into the battle scenes, to lighten the dark mood, and in the theater I was in, it was appreciated.Overall, a good movie, but lacking in the diverse scenery the first one had (the environments in this one are a little dull, mainly on the grey and brown side) and some of the things I had a little trouble taking seriously (Fear the mighty Ents!) 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel Tolkien would be glad that his work was masterfully portrayed on the big screen. The atmosphere and realism created throughout the middle-earth landscape and characters brought much excitement. The power of the ring penetrates through the movie screen as you see the constant struggle within Frodo and the demise and mischievous nature of Gollem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding, if not totally enjoyable, movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the monumental achievement of The Fellowship of the Rings. It is an intelligent and tasteful fantasy epic. That said you might find it a movie you respect more than enjoy. Watching it can be a distant and cold experience. You seem to be viewing the romance and adventure through a frosty blue lens. The Two Towers is the second chapter of a trilogy that makes little concession to those who come in late. You are thrust into the middle of the action as Frodo and Sam make their way to the cursed land of Mordor. Aragorn and his party track the Orc band that kidnapped Pippin and Merry at the end of The Fellowship of the Rings. Two and a half hours of high fantasy mayhem later you are again left dangling ? but not before meeting enough characters to populate ten normal sized movies. This brings up a point: While it is not strictly necessary to read Tolkien's books or watch the first movie to enjoy The Two Towers, such preliminary preparation will help keep your Éomérs separate from your Éowyns and Éothains. The Two Towers cast is, again, led by Ian McKellen as the durable wizard Gandolf. McKellen's exceptional performance does not steal the movie; rather he is like a star quarterback leading a winning team to victory. Most all the actors were memorable up to and including the computer generated Gollum. The exceptions were, unfortunately, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin as the heroic hobbits Frodo and Sam. Their rather bland performances and wandering accents diminished the impact of Frodo's quest to Mordor. That quest is, after all, the backbone of the trilogy. This is not a fatal flaw as the other performances and the sheer spectacle of The Two Towers is more than enough to carry you through the few dead moments.Spectacle the Two Towers has in overflowing abundance. Magical and fantasy elements seem to play more of a role here than in Fellowship of the Rings so you have swooping dragons, giant walking trees, huge armies of hell-beasts and a castle assault the likes you've never seen. The siege of Helm's Deep could have been a movie unto itself and is the undisputed highlight of The Two Towers. The epic promise of magical fantasy is realized here but, do to the uniform strength of the cast's performances, all the blood and thunder on display is not at the expense of the characters or their story. Director Peter Jackson does have some chinks in his style. He has yet to develop a flair for epic movie making. It sometimes seems that his sole way of showing off the size of his movie is with great swooping helicopter shots. Other times he sprints his camera through intriguing environments too quickly to get a real sense of the scene. He also indulges in some topical comedy that, while undeniably funny, is gratingly anachronistic and has the effect of momentarily rousing you from the mood the rest of the movie has carefully built. These, however, are small problems that barely scuff the surface sheen of The Two Towers. A larger barrier to truly enjoying this movie is the afore-mentioned remoteness of its style. This may be more a matter of personal taste than anything else. To me the cool and formal presentation was a little off-putting. To others it might strike just the right note of grandeur. There should be no argument, however, that The Two Towers is a film to be reckoned with and that the cinematic Lord of the Rings trilogy will be judged as much a classic as its literary forbearer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed a bit, weak in spots, richer in fantasy and a worthy sequal to a masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning - SPOILERS included...Magic with which middle earth came to life in Fellowship is wearing thin in The Two Towers. Its a complicated trilogy, maybe the most complicated filmmaking ever attempted. Not just adapting Tolkien's story for the screen, but the filmmaking craft itself is stressed to the limits. It must have been a nightmare to shoot, all the angles for a single scene, and I can only imagine the horror of editting it...However, while technical part of the craft is well done with only minor quibbles, its the storytelling that suffers in The Two Towers. Though I am a great Tolkien fan, I am reviewing Towers as a film buff. Books aside, this is a separate creation. When Towers work, they do so splendidly, but when they dont they dwell on mediocracy. This however is not the fault of being a "middle" film.The Ents with Merry and Pippin story is the most solid part of the Towers. It has ups and downs but it stays coherent. When it suffers it does so due to it being the shortest of the three stories. It is unfolded a bit awkwardly at times, considering what is going on in the other two. Visualising walking and talking trees is no easy task, and they are visualised perfectly. They brought tears to my eyes...The main plot with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli is a mish mash. They have a task and they are at it. Sadly, it doesnt work all the time. The plight of Rohan is established well, with a small village forced to exile before an orcish onslaught. The trouble begins in Edoras. Bits were corny, purging Saruman from Theoden - the excorcism scene for example. Bigger fault by far is the retreat to Helm's Deep. I never really felt like it was something they had to do. It felt contrived, devoid of suffering. The plight of Rohan that was well established early on was not continued here.Battle of Hornburg, the Helm's Deep is generally well done but is set up with mixed emotions. A few corny scenes before the battle ruin the atmosphere and despair of Rohan men, women and children is not portrayed well. The battle itself is grand, trully epic. Some heroic stunts could have been omitted though.Frodo and Sam and Gollum, ah yes, the Gollum. All Kudos to Peter Jackson and the crew for the Gollum they created. They could have easily gone for a cute Gollum, E.T.esque... Instead, they brought a trully sad and tormented creature to life. The Towers shine when Gollum is on screen. The Smeagol vs Gollum dialogue is amazing. You love him and hate him at the same time.The weakest part of the Towers is the story of Frodo, Sam and Gollum encountering Faramir and the army of Gondor. It is cold and uninvolved. The whole plot is too long for the little it tells. Faramir had to be introduced better... Only magical moment here is Gollum running with a fish in his mouth!As a whole, three hours of The Two Towers go by in a breeze. Hopefully the extended edition will remedy some of the problems. The magic of Fellowship still lives in Towers. Except in Gollum scenes, it is most evident when Gandalf with Eomer and the riders of Rohan charge down the hill into thousands of orcs... It cuts then to the Ents tearing through Isengard... Epic, trully epic... It brought tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson continues to thrive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's "The Two Towers" wastes very little time getting his audience awe stricken with just the opening scene! Jackson brings to life another part of the Lord of the Rings saga that was only mentioned in the books (there are some things that only can be achieved in movie-making, aka the imprisonment of Gandalf in FOTR).Jackson continues to thrive in his recreation of Middle Earth... Rohan, Fanghorn and Helm's Deep seem to be pulled from the pages of Tolkien with nearly flawless effort, and the casting being equally yet hauntingly perfect. Brad Dourif "is" Wormtongue, and Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill are also stunningly believable as Eowyn and Theoden King.Ian McKellen once again stands out, taking the role of Gandalf to another level, accompanied with outstanding performances by Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, etc...I particularly enjoyed the character development of John Rhys-Davies's character Gimli (though I see some "critics" of the film did not).The CGI characters like Gollem, Treebeard and the ents were also extremely believable to the point you forget that they were animations. Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollem) did a fantastic job portraying Smeagol's duality.Without saying too much, the battle for Helm's Deep must be seen to believe!There are a lot of "critics" or "Tolkien Purists" downplaying these films. I, myself have read the books on 4 occasions and still believe whole-heartily that Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien is as close as we're ever gonna get. Simply putting it, there are some things better in the book, yet (to the horror of the "purists") there are some things better in the movies! I personally didn't see eye to eye with everything Jackson did, however I'll save my criticizing for the thousands of horrible films out there that lack the same passion Jackson has put into these films.10/10 ...and if I could, I'd give it an 11!("these go to 11"- SPINAL TAP)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE-PETER JACKSON DOES IT AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film! How could anyone say otherwise? The Two Towers is far better than even its brilliant predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson, the director who started his career by making gross, R-rated horror spoofs, has established himself as one of the most amazing directors of our time. I don't think I need to go into details about the film's plot. If you haven't seen the film, you are missing out on something great, so just go and see it!!! probably what stands out about this film is the actors. Elijah Wood shows even greater talent than in the previous film, as the hobbit Frodo, who is starting to succumb to the power of the ring. Wood portrays the confusion and fear of his character with great mastery. Viggo Mortensen is even better as Aragorn, the uncrowned King of Gondor. Mortensen doesn't over play his character, he does brilliantly portraying Aragorn as the quiet, but courageous man. Ian McKellen downplays his character Gandalf quiet significantly compared to the first film. This, I believe, is a good thing. It makes Gandalf seem more REAL to the viewer. Let's hope he gets another OSCAR nod this year! Gollum, the computer animated creature with the voice and scanned movements provided by the extraordinary Andy Serkis. Who is this man who brings his character to life so perfectly? His voice acting is impossibly good, just the way Gollum would have spoken!I think Serkis should receive a SPECIAL OSCAR for his performance, since it doesn't fit into any other categories. The cinematography and special effects etc. are all brilliant, of course, and capture the mood of the film perfectly. But perhaps what stands out about the film even more than the acting is the script. Fran Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair and Jackson have made this film a scripting masterpiece. Their incredible screenplay is, at all the right times, exhilarating, humorous, dark, touching, and even romantic! It is perhaps the best thing about the film. If you haven't seen The Two Towers, hurry up and do it! And if you liked it, watch the OSCARS as well!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's my least favorite question: "Well, did you read the books?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, yes, Peter Jackson's second installment in this troll-filled trilogy is epic, it's huge, it's masterful, it's scary at times, it's an incredible blend of special effects and New Zealand landscapes, it's better than all the new Star Wars movies put together. It also contains, however, one of the most boring hours in recent cinema history: the epic-yet-deeply-personal-for-five-or-six-characters battle preparations sequence. Warning: no one will be admitted during any of the very important `So it has come to this? war!' speeches delivered by somebodyorother. In this long, long, thudding hour, scenes are repeated, dialogue is switched around and re-spoken, and actors dressed as elves clearly expect to be taken seriously. So, okay, fine, the whole movie's long. I've gotta get over that, right? But when I to, I found that it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Here are a few of my questions:- If Gandalf is really that powerful, why can't he do more?- Where the hell did Gandalf go for most of the movie and how did he show up with thousands of soldiers at the end? - What was all that stuff with Frodo being kidnapped and taken to some city under siege? - If Helm's Deep is such a great place to go when under attack by Orks, why does it look more like everybody's backed themselves into a corner?- If those black riders are really that scary, why is it so easy to hide from them? - If the whole schtick of the tree characters is that they take their sweet time making decisions, how come they make the sudden decision to go to war when they see their forest has been wrecked? - Why were there nine black riders on horseback in the first movie but now there's only one of them, and he's riding a dragon? - What were the Two Towers? I guess they were the volcano and the other thing, or maybe the other thing and the totem pole they put Gandalf on in the first movie, but until the last moments of this movie, I never saw them together, and didn't really understand what would be so bad about just letting Christopher Lee build his damn towers. When I ask people these questions, their response is inevitably, `Well, did you read the books?' Hell, yes, I read the books and forgot them years ago, and don't change the subject. Nobody should need a bibliography to watch these movies. I admit this much: the computer-generated Golem character is great. Undeniably great, so great that you forget he's computer-generated, so great you want him to be the main character, so great that it's worth the price of admission just to see him, so great that all the scenes he's in become the best scenes in the movie. So, yes, it's better than the new Star Wars movies, and George Lucas should be very jealous of Peter Jackson. But at least the first couple of Star Wars movies had some genuine laughs in them, and didn't make you sit there for three and a half hours. Knowing when to let your audience leave the theater is a big part of being a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first? Hard one to judge....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i had seen this movie i felt pretty blown away and immediately thought that it was better than the first movie. Then after a while when the movie had sunk in so to speak i found myself only remembering the action-parts of it, and there are a lot of them believe me. The first movie had more heart and soul to it. Of course Gollum had a very good performance as a CGI character and Gimli makes you laugh at times, so there is heart in it.The fact that it didn't follow the book i had been warned about so that didn't effect me except one HUGE thing, to me anyway: The absence of Narsil in Aragorns hands. In the book he uses this white-glowing sword in the battle at Helms deep. I don't know how and when Peter Jackson is gonna "give" him it. A major fault which really ticked me off...Credit were credits due tho, the opening scene is one of the best in cinema history.The conclusion is that i could go either way with TTT. Since i gave FOTR 7/10 i guess i have to give it at least that.... 7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TTT, grand, epic, touching, bold. Even though it deviates away from the book more so than FotR, it succeeded my expectations and was better than I initially feared (after FotR, how can you top that?). Helms Deep, one of the most powerful battles have witnessed in a long time.... just imagine what the battles of RotK will be like.... The Treebeard scenes were beautiful, and a lovely moment with Merry and Pippin; There will be no more Shire. Congratulations to Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd there. Eowyn and Eomer, Couldn't have been better casting here. I do feel that both were highly under used. Miranda Otto understood Eowyn's frustration and fear of captivity, her need to fight. I look forward to the more pivotal scenes featuring her in RotK. Gollum, I don't think there is anything different to say except what has already been written on this site time and time again. Magnificent achievement by all involved. Andy Serkis' gollum rasp is terrifying and so alike what I had imagined, and the creation never once took away from the movie. Creepy and pitiful, setting a new standard for CGI. I still feel there is a little loss of something concerning Faramir. The acting from David Wenham was fine, just the twist of the character from the book, and I do understand Peter Jackson's reasonings though, it was just a shame that some wonderful moments and touches from the book had to be missed because of this change. There is one scene that I have not once seen mentioned anywhere but worked so brilliantly - Wormtongue standing by Saruman looking over the vast army of orcs, with a tear running down his cheek...Of shock and disbelief of the number of orcs... It worked so well in the context of that scene and it struck the right nerve with me. And again, thank you Peter Jackson for FotR and now TTT. Just like FotR, it reminds me how special the books are to myself and so many others, and that there are movies out there worth returning to the cinema to see again and again. RotK can't come soon enough!</fullReview>

CGI can work for some films, like EVOLUTION, DEEP RISING, DRAGON HEART, and a few others, but recently it has looked cheap and rushed. Anamatronic monsters, stop-motion, make-up and other forms of puppetry would look much more realistic, and I am sure many people would agree with me. But it is still a good movie, if you can over look the unconvincing CGI.</fullReview>

I gotta say the scope of the battle scenes were huge and awe inspiring, and the FX for Gollum was excellent, but...As a story that is meant to elicit an emotional response this movie failed miserably. Part of it must have been the hype that surrounded the movie, but alot of it was with the movies failure to be anything more than eye candy. In defense of the director, it may not be possible to capture the scope of the epic that Tolkien created. Maybe it is, but the way Jackson has done it has not compelled me to be interested in the fate of the characters. Maybe its the acting. I never really got any sense that I cared about any of the characters.I could rant on about any number of other issues, but you get the gist of my opinion... didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings, the epic trilogy composed originally by J.R.R. Tolkien, is in the process of becoming moviemaking history. The Fellowship of the Ring, the first novel/movie of the series, was an awe-inspiring, terrifying, and powerful film. Its post-9/11 themes of good vs. evil, hope, and faith were inspiring and heart-wrenching. The acting was superb, the special effects were amazing-nearly every aspect of that film was miles above average. Peter Jackson had done it. He had pulled off what could not be done: creating the greatest fantasy novel of all time and making into an incredible fantasy film. Now came the real question: could he do it again? Ultimately the answer is a well-affirmed "hell yeah." The Two Towers begins in glorious fashion: a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. However this time, we watch as he tumbles into the center of the Earth, battling the flaming, snarling creature. When the scene concludes, there are some minor problems. The first couple of scenes with Frodo and Sam feel a bit strained, almost edited too much. The terror of the Ring is gone, as well is the fear of Sauron. However we do have the introduction of the splendid Gollum, and now the story takes on a new life. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are busy hunting down a band of Uruk-Hai holding their friends captive. Blood is shed and confusion enters and now we have three separate story lines: Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf (in case you didn't know he's not dead), Merry, Pippin, and the Ents (a dull story until an ultimate payoff), and Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Gandalf and his three companions venture into Rohan, where lies King Theoden. After a glorious exorcism and an emotional heartbreak, Gandalf begins consulting Theoden on a plan to defend his city against Uruk-Hai that are just itching to attack. Eventually, Saruman (the creepy wizard gone bad, allied with Sauron) launches his army of 10,000 Uruk Hai against the band of 300 civilians who have retreated to Helm's Deep, a sort-of fallout refuge for Rohan. Now for the analysis: Storyline: Alright!! Things are differentc than from the books!!! GET OVER IT!! The major changes are not so bad anyway. Faramir has now become a violent power-hungry slug that is even worse than his brother Boromir, who at least evoked some emotion and humanity. This is an awkward change, however with the removal of Shelob from the end of the movie, the action in Frodo and Sam's storyline would be nonexistent. There had to be a change. And for the people upset over the elves aiding at Helm's Deep: elves rule. Overall the plot is coherent and interesting. Acting: GOLLUM!!!! Jesus that CGI is incredible. He looks unbelievably real, and the acting is phenomenal. He might not deserve the Oscar but Serkis does deserve the recognition. Viggo Mortenson gives an awesome performance as Aragorn, the wily, reluctant, romantic hero who is grappling with his destiny as the future king of Gondor. He might very well come away with a Best Actor or Best Supporing Actor nomination. Ian McKellen HAS GOT GANDALF DOWN. Too bad he's not in more of the movie, or he would be another lock on a BSA nod. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin turn in solid performances as Frodo and Sam, respectively. Astin's speech at the end is quite a 9/11 allegory. Bernard Hill is wonderful as King Theoden, and Mirando Otto is lively and Leia-ish as Eowyn. Cate Blanchett is barely in the movie, as is Hugo Weaving, but Liv Tyler still manages to impress. I never thought she could pull of Arwen but she does do it pretty well. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies give jolly, but ferocious performances as Legolas and Gimli. Gotta' love a dwarf with an axe. Wenham is average as Faramir, not nearly as human as Sean Bean's Boromir. Christopher Lee is barely in the movie, as is Brad Dourif, but they both deliver freaky performances nonetheless. Merry and Pippin and Treebeard at first seem a bit annoying, but the assault on Isengard is a spectacular, oddly moving event. Special Effects: GREAT!!! END OF STORY!! OSCAR GUARANTEED!The Two Towers proves to be a great film. It's moving, glorious, and pretty in its stunningness. There are moments that will make your heart cry out in joy, and there are times where you will remember things that don't seem so distant in today's world. What a great film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has become one of the greatest achievements ever in cinema. From its flabbergasting landscapes to the amazing CGI creature Gollum, Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's legendary second chapter has come to life yet again in an astonishing way. While it does stray from the book more than Fellowship did, the heart of the story is still there. I believe The Return of the King will be the crowning achievement of the trilogy and highly anticipate its release!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LoTR: TTT has got to be one of the best movies I've watched. Not only because I enjoyed the work of the actors, but also because the great book, "The Two Towers" by J.R.R.Tolkien is a masterpiece. I never expected anything good from the movie, because the movies usually make the great books look and sound stupid, but on the contrary after watching the movie a lot of people I know decided to take time and read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2002's Greatest film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until 'The Two Towers' came out, I thought 'Road to Perdition' was the best movie I had seen for the year. 'The Two Towers' blows everything else away!Peter Jackson has outdone himself. When I saw trailers for 'Towers' I had the feeling it would be more of the same. Not so! The plot and character development are complex and fascinating. Woe to those who haven't seen the first film, and know nothing about Middle Earth!The battle at Helm's Deep is simply the greatest battle scene in movie history! 'Star Wars II' and its massive clone armies is sterile compared to this, and all other older movies with huge battle scenes now seem out of date. The buildup to this battle is tremendous, with fights and flights, hatred and wizardy, and moments of love and humor. Many new characters are introduced (wait until you see Gollum!).The cinematography in beautiful New Zealand is outstanding. Helm's Deep looks as real as it possibly could.The special effects are perfect! This movie could not have been made as well even five years ago. Gollum is the pinnacle of CGI! All credit must go to Peter Jackson, who has driven himself and his cast and crew to the breaking point, and come out the other side intact with a classic trilogy in hand (there is no way that 'Return of the King' can be stinker, so I feel confident using the word 'classic').Remember when you saw the gee-whiz sheen and excitement of 'Star Wars' and then when you saw 'The Empire Strikes Back' you were taken deeper, got more involved, and realized you were witnessing epic history? Same here, and on a grander, more mythical scale.If 'Fellowship of the Ring' didn't win any major Oscars, then unfortunately 'Towers' won't either. But it will be a shame if Peter Jackson is overlooked. This trilogy will most certainly be the pinnacle of his career, and he deserves recognition for his awe-inspiring direction commitment.This is grand filmmaking at its finest, and why we go to movies. Make sure you see this on the big screen-- twice at least!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2nd Best Movie Of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the Fellowship of the Ring, I was disappointed because of all the hype and I didnt think it lived up to the hype. I overeacted and said that it was bad but it isnt its just very overrated. So I had mixed feelings about seeing The Two Towers, but after I saw it I thought it was a huge improvement over the Fellowship. Now I have never read the books I just think these movies look really interesting.The Two Towers still has excellent visual effects (like Fellowship did) and they put them to good measure in the movie. The Battle of Helms Deep was brilliantly directed and was probably the best battle in a fantasy movie. The other Battles were well shot, I really like the one at Isengrad with the trees vs. The Orcs. They also used their special effects to create Gollum who is by far the best CGI character ever made. The academy should make an exception and nominate him, he definitely deserves it. This will definitely win an Oscar for Visual Effects.I think everything else in the movie was excellent, the Art direction, Cinematography and Costume are top notch. The Screenplay was much better too. I think it will get a Best Picture and Best Director, but sadly it wont win. But there is another that will most likely win and its the only film to come in front of it this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad changes + parody + magnificence = quite ok.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a good film of an epic the size of Tolkien's LOTR, is a difficult task. In the Fellowship Jackson pulled it off, but TTT, although quite ok as a whole, is full of questions for me.First of all, when the changes in the plot of the Fellowship were justified, it is difficult for me to accept a lot of them in TTT. Rohan looked nothing like Tolkien described it, with Edoras looking like a poor village situated in not even remotely similar geographical surroundings. The jokes were sometimes a bit out of place; (Spoiler!) e.g Gimli's and Legolas' `shall I find you a box' joke - extremely poorly acted by Orlando Bloom and a joke that did not correspond to the mood of the whole scene really. Faramir had gone through a personality change - one of the most unfortunate changes of them all, as Tolkien's Faramir was quite the opposite of Boromir and as such very believable considering the family problems behind it. And ents, although quite good visually, were not interested in anything, thus resulting in a very weak story line. Was it really necessary to make such changes to make the situation look more desperate and difficult?And of course (Spoiler!), the arrival of the elves to Helm's deep?!? Come on! Of course, this story line is surrounded by more controversies than I'd like to describe. In the Fellowship they wanted to help, in the beginning of TTT they didn't and left for Valinor, but in the end showed up in Helm's Deep anyway? Where's the logic to that? Or is it just some extremely complicated and unsuccessful way to show the inner struggles of Elrond?In addition to Faramir's personality change, another one that bothered me already in the Fellowship was Aragorn's indecisiveness. Reading the book, Aragorn was always aware of his role and his task, with his whole life being a preparation for the LOTR action. Although in the `original' version of the Fellowship this change is not so pronounced, the director's cut makes it even clearer. Such change, although not a very good one, adds depth to the character (as do Aragorn's conversations with Arwen and Elrond in TTT, which were good, no doubt in that) and certainly does make the movie more dramatic.And of course, I'm really sorry for pointing this out and maybe it is a result of my twisted sense of humor, but some of the scenes seemed like a parody of something I've seen before. (Spoilers!) Faramir &amp;co fighting the Southrons and oliphaunts looked like Robin Hood and his merry men. Elf troops looked like coming directly from a Star Wars movie. The orc running to the wall of Helm's Deep with the aim to blow it up and other orcs cheering along, looked like a ridiculous mix of lighting the fire during the Olympic Games and some teenagers' movie with the compulsory slow motion scene of a football game.However, there were quite a lot of simply magnificent things. The landscape was absolutely breathtaking. The emotions behind actions were well justified, although for someone who has not read the book some of the things may seem coming from nowhere and thus not logical. Aragorn-Eowyn relationship was intriguing, and well played by both actors. (Spoiler: there is a wonderfully played and cut scene of the meeting of Legolas and Aragorn in Helm's Deep, when Legolas returns the jewel - look at Eowyn's face.) Gimli and Legolas were as stylish as in the Fellowship and made a wonderful duo. The cast did a very nice job indeed (with a couple of exceptional scenes) despite the `one-liners' tendency in the script. Gollum was simply brilliant - the way his split character and the inside good vs bad fights were depicted made some of the best scenes in the whole film. And the jokes, of course.Well, I could go on for quite some time with this list, but in short, the movie was quite ok. Although not an improvement compared to the Fellowship, it's certainly worth seeing, and probably the more you see it the better it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film for the 3rd time, I feel I can now write a clear evaluation of it. I would also like to add that I have read TLOTR about 10 times, starting age 6, so I have a good knowledge of the original story.I'm fully aware of the need to adapt a story to make it work on the screen, and I was always willing to accept these changes, despite my love of the original story. Like someone said, if I want the original story, I'll read the books again.However, I become somewhat annoyed when I feel the plot has been changed for no great reason, and and this happened several times in this film. Most notable was the adaptation of Faramir and his decision to take Frodo to Osgiliath. Faramir is meant to display his quality and strength by letting Frodo go, something Boromir could not do. Instead, he shows himself to be as weak as every other man, rather than proving himself.Another instance is the behavior of the Ents. A sudden desicion to wage war on Orthanc is really out of character of such a race, and that really jarred for me.Helms Deep was good, but I felt it was overextended at the cost of other elements of the film (i.e. the relationship between Frodo and Sam) I appreciate, however, that this was a change needed to satisfy the mindless punter, and suffer it as such.The film is still 100/100 for me, but a few little changes and it could have been so much better. I await the Extended Edition with anticipation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of this movie is about Barlago from Garganda who needs to get to Margalala before the Embligs reach it and try to destroy the Ziglwigs... or something like that. Maybe if I had immersed myself in the trilogy and attended sci-fi conventions beforehand, I could've actually understood the story. Instead, it plays like a big, spectacular video game. Admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it because it is visually the most amazing thing we've seen on the screen yet, especially the computer generated character with the big ears (Grogglegorf, I think). All the names sound alike, most of the characters look alike, and there are too many of them to care about any of them. The scene with the H.R. Puffenstuff trees was mildly humorous, although I don't think that was intentional. So the plot is probably even less penetrable to non-geeks than the first one, but it is oh so fun to watch. If you are not a sci-fi geek, go for the visuals. Computer graphics have reached the promised land -- it is a landmark movie in that regard. Just don't expect to be included in this little Star Trek Convention of a movie unless you've read the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning! This Contains Spoilers! Beware!Bravo Peter Jackson! You have kept me on the edge waiting to see Return of the King. The Two Towers was a magnificent movie, beautifully shot, with a great cast, and a worthy successor to the Fellowship of the Ring. Andy Serkis was the best actor I've seen in a digital role, he might even be the best actor in the movie. You're supposed to hate Gollum, yet you have to feel bad for him. I especially enjoyed the (Spoilers) Fell Beasts the Nazgul rode, The Ents destroying Isengard, the Black Gates, and the mentioning of "she" at the end.However, I was angry to see that numerous sections (including the whole last third of the book) were changed or just thrown out. (Spoilers) I did not like the changes made for the character of Faramir. They changed him from a great, kind, noble man to almost a mirror image of his brother. Second of all, Aragorn falling of a cliff was just stupid. (The Warg battle was cool though)And I don't know where Peter Jackson got the idea to put elves in the battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. It just doesn't make any sense.I personally liked the Fellowship of the Ring a little better than the Two Towers. A person who has not read the books, will more likely enjoy the two Towers better than The Fellowship of the Ring, for it is faster-paced, comical, and action packed. The Fellowship was was long, was stuffed with too much information, and went to a lot many places with out a lot of time for the viewer to catch on. If you are like me, and have enjoyed Tolkien's works, you will most likely joy the Fellowship, for it is true to his word. The Two Towers was one of the best things $8.50 bought this year and I want it on DVD! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, The Fellowship really impressed me, couse when i left the cinema I thought to myself:"This is the movie of my life!", but it is no more, now The Two Towers is the movie of my life, no doubt about it.It's simply amazing, since the beggining till the end, everything is very well done, the sceneries, the creatures, the special effects, and the casting is again, very well done. All those different hedious monsters are so well detailed that you actually think that sometime in our history, in our world they really walked and lived, creatures like the Ents, man, i used to see them in Magic The Gathering, not to mension Golum, this is the most well done creature i've seen in 17 years of my life it really is, he grabs they're clothes, pushes them and you dont note any difference before or after that contact, everything is so fluid so well thought that you just ignore the fact that he's not flesh but pixels.Another thing are the breathtaking backgrounds, i like watching them just to see some of the most beautifful things that our world can give us, all those natural sites, those greeny hills, the wonderfull mountains...just perfect!Again all the characters have a very specific role in this epic, they all make us believe so hardly in that powerfull journey that we actually get into it. Congratulations Viggo, and his fellow "friends" for they're great acting, i just hope they keep making movies like this one.To finnish i would just like to add something, if you are reading this and still considering if should go see the movie in a big screen, then get your ass up and ran to the nearest movie theather couse this is a movie that you simply cant miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important considerations to take into account when analyzing a film like this is the issue of medium. We must realize that there is simply no way to transfer a work of art from one medium to another. Sure, we may agree that Tolkien's book are masterpieces. And we can say that an adaptation of such a great work has a better chance of being a great work in its own right. But we must not mistake one work for the other. Peter Jackson's films are not the books. Now there's no getting around the obvious connections between the two. Many of us have grown up with a vivid image of Middle Earth in our heads, and we should expect to compare this vision with what is presented on the screen. But they will not, can not, be the same vision.So issues such as changes made to the plotline should be considered (as much as possible) within the context of the film. Did the omission of Shelob create a better story, or worse? Did Aragorn's little near-death excursion improve the pacing and flow of the narrative or not? Faramir? The Elf battalion? We obviously can not remove from our selves all previous conceptions of Middle Earth, but we must remember that these films are NOT actually Tolkien's LOTR. They must be considered on their own.I appreciate PJ's decision to make TTT a more action-orriented film. An attempt to recreate Tolkien's TT would have made a much less interesting and beautiful film. For the most part, the casting continues to be first rate. Although she will never match my original conception, M. Otto's Eowyn was a particularly thrilling character. As with most, I was confused by Faramir's characterization. I think, however, that a fully introduced Faramir coming at the end of the film would have been awkward and would have greatly detracted from the film real hero, Aragorn. So we'll have to wait for TROTK to see Faramir in full force. The looks of the Ents was less than spectacular, but they came off fairly well as a whole. Wood's Frodo continues to descend into a frightening sort of madness and Austin's Sam continues to develop. I couldn't help but chuckle at the inclusion of Sam's story speech near the end. Insert director's tough into cheek.In the end, this is a fine film, although not quite as good as last year's Fellowship. Personal rating are subjective, but as much as I love the film with its beauty and tragedy so masterfully portrayed, this is no top ten of all time film. It is, however, a brilliant fusion of heroic drama, deep apreciation of ideals, and spectacular technique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, was this movie worth the wait. The Two towers picks up where the Fellowship ends. This movie is not better or worse because it is a continuation. Its part of one big movie that the great writer J.R.R. Tolkien fit into three books. Let me begin by saying that the cinematography and visual effects alone make the movie worth seeing.The familiar characters from the first movie return and we are introduced to new ones. In this film the characters are more fleshed out. We see how the burden of having to destroy the ring has on frodo and sam. The characters of Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas all go on their seperate ways to fight the orcs and help the people of the town of Rohan. They all must fight against the forces of Saruman and his evil soldiers called orcs. The two new characters that really blew me away were treebeard and gollum.Gollum more than the former was such a rich and conflicted character. He is totally computer animated, but we feel his inner pain and conflict within to resist the ring. We want him to be good and turn his life around. The battle of helms deep at the end is one of the best I have seen put on film. The only other battles that even rival it are in Braveheart or in the Patriot. Both of these are Mel Gibson movies which are both worth seeing.In my opinion Peter Jackson is a genius for bringing these movies to life. They will go down in history as one of the best trilogies ever made. Everyone should see this film.</fullReview>

On the other side there are films. First film was nice, but Frodo's(Elijah Wood) acting was horrible (especially the ghastly laughter at the beginning), and also the other actors didn't really live in their characters, and I felt that certain something was missing, but besides that I still bought the DVD and watched it approx. five times.And then came TTT, I thought they would get it right this time. (Next lines may contain spoilers). First thing that troubled me was the part with Frodo and Sam, I know it is hard to bear the ring and that Frodo thinks he is too weak for the quest etc. but that doesn't mean that he should look and behave like he is on heavy drugs and/or is brain-dead. Also the Gollum's inner conflict shouldn't be like he has multiple personality disorder. Also there are some useless and pointless scenes (Battle for Osgiliath, Legolas jumping on the horse and Aragorn's mourning over the dead elf) in witch Jackson was showing off what he can do even if he destroys the plot-line and makes movie too long and boring. After 178 minutes of journey through the Middle earth I finally knew what was missing, THE SOUL AND THE COMMON SENSE witch unables this movie to be the true masterpiece. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, The Fellowship really impressed me, couse when i left the cinema I thought to myself:"This is the movie of my life!", but it is no more, now The Two Towers is the movie of my life, no doubt about it.It's simply amazing, since the beggining till the end, everything is very well done, the sceneries, the creatures, the special effects, and the casting is again, very well done. All those different hedious monsters are so well detailed that you actually think that sometime in our history, in our world they really walked and lived, creatures like the Ents, man, i used to see them in Magic The Gathering, not to mension Golum, this is the most well done creature i've seen in 17 years of my life it really is, he grabs they're clothes, pushes them and you dont note any difference before or after that contact, everything is so fluid so well thought that you just ignore the fact that he's not flesh but pixels.Another thing are the breathtaking backgrounds, i like watching them just to see some of the most beautifful things that our world can give us, all those natural sites, those greeny hills, the wonderfull mountains...just perfect!Again all the characters have a very specific role in this epic, they all make us believe so hardly in that powerfull journey that we actually get into it. Congratulations Viggo, and his fellow "friends" for they're great acting, i just hope they keep making movies like this one.To finnish i would just like to add something, if you are reading this and still considering if should go see the movie in a big screen, then get your ass up and ran to the nearest movie theather couse this is a movie that you simply cant miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important considerations to take into account when analyzing a film like this is the issue of medium. We must realize that there is simply no way to transfer a work of art from one medium to another. Sure, we may agree that Tolkien's book are masterpieces. And we can say that an adaptation of such a great work has a better chance of being a great work in its own right. But we must not mistake one work for the other. Peter Jackson's films are not the books. Now there's no getting around the obvious connections between the two. Many of us have grown up with a vivid image of Middle Earth in our heads, and we should expect to compare this vision with what is presented on the screen. But they will not, can not, be the same vision.So issues such as changes made to the plotline should be considered (as much as possible) within the context of the film. Did the omission of Shelob create a better story, or worse? Did Aragorn's little near-death excursion improve the pacing and flow of the narrative or not? Faramir? The Elf battalion? We obviously can not remove from our selves all previous conceptions of Middle Earth, but we must remember that these films are NOT actually Tolkien's LOTR. They must be considered on their own.I appreciate PJ's decision to make TTT a more action-orriented film. An attempt to recreate Tolkien's TT would have made a much less interesting and beautiful film. For the most part, the casting continues to be first rate. Although she will never match my original conception, M. Otto's Eowyn was a particularly thrilling character. As with most, I was confused by Faramir's characterization. I think, however, that a fully introduced Faramir coming at the end of the film would have been awkward and would have greatly detracted from the film real hero, Aragorn. So we'll have to wait for TROTK to see Faramir in full force. The looks of the Ents was less than spectacular, but they came off fairly well as a whole. Wood's Frodo continues to descend into a frightening sort of madness and Austin's Sam continues to develop. I couldn't help but chuckle at the inclusion of Sam's story speech near the end. Insert director's tough into cheek.In the end, this is a fine film, although not quite as good as last year's Fellowship. Personal rating are subjective, but as much as I love the film with its beauty and tragedy so masterfully portrayed, this is no top ten of all time film. It is, however, a brilliant fusion of heroic drama, deep apreciation of ideals, and spectacular technique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awesome film, I found it hard to accept that they could better part one?and they did!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is filled with stunning visuals, of huge battles, landscapes and little creatures that love the darkness and their precious. The performances are wholly wonderful and pull you into the story without a second thought, with a plot that totally immerses you and will hardly let you take a breath until the very end. The effects are stunning, although some of the more distant people or crowd scenes were a bit noticeable; none of it takes away from the story. The grand scenes are so visually and emotionally rich, you can't help but feel affected by them, I was moved at quite a few scenes. There were internal cheers, genuine sympathy for characters, and an overwhelming emotion as the riders charge down the hill. This series is destined to go down in history, and no doubt they will all end in the top ten films of all time, if not five!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically impressive, but something important is missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice scenery and fantastic photo albeit the data-animated parts are a bit too obvious, except for Sméagol who is the best "actor" of the film. This film was simply too long and focusing far too much on cool battles and fights that are filmed in a too high tempo so that the feeling is left out. Incidentally this is the case throughout the film, I left with a feeling that something was missing; something that couldn't be grasped.The love scenes are too plastic, and the actors are mis-used, poor Ian McKellen's talent is wasted in comparison to the first picture. One nice thing though is too see Prince John finally become King, haha. Also too many unnecessary and bad changes from the story in the book; they did not improve the cineastic impact. Cut down the film to half its length would be more appropriate. Am I negative? Nevertheless I would rate it between 6 and 7 out of 10.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! Ease up on Jackson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to address all those who are raging with Balrog-like fury that Peter Jackson did not follow the books to a "T" when he wrote the screenplays for these films (along with Walsh, Boyens, and Sinclair). Who says he must? YOU??? I admit I've not read the books yet, but I just finished The Hobbit and am now beginning FOTR. I'm sure I'll be a bit disappointed also when I find things in the books that are nowhere in the films, but why must we always lash out with anger when a screenplay does not precisely mirror the book it's based on in every way? Books are nearly always better than their movies. Why? Because of the power of your own imagination. No Hollywood director past, present, or future can compete with that. Jackson and the entire team down to those guys putting all that chain-mail together link by link (see the bonus stuff on the extended dvd edition of FOTR) are simply doing a sensational job on these films. Special kudos to Howard Shore for composing the hauntingly beautiful music that transports us to Middle-Earth. I especially like the part in the score where Gandalf and the Balrog plunge into that monstrous cavern just before they hit the water. In my humble opinion (and I've heard it from others, too), nearly every moment in these films is a work of art. This is the first time I can truly call a movie a masterpiece. Please, PLEASE, just enjoy the movies by themselves. Don't criticize them because of their differences from the books. You'll live a longer and happier life if you can practice less-cynical things like that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITSeriously, how can anyone with at least one brain cell can say that this is a masterpiece? And how can anyone call Peter Jackson a genius? You want masterpieces, there are plenty of them out there... Vertigo, Barton Fink, from more recent years Gosford Park, almost all of Kubrick's filmography, Chinatown, Rosemary's baby, Otto e mezzo...First of all I didn't walk in the cinema expecting a masterpiece like the ones mentioned above. I like a lot the Tolkien novels and I wanted to see a good adaptation. Having not liked the first one I thought I could spend an entertaining time watching excelent special effects. The film was so bad I couldn't even do that.First of all, does any of the five (five!) screenwriters know what the word "adaptation" means? It's imposible to be faithful to such a long and detailed novel. You have to remember you're making cinema for people who didn't read the book and write a screenplay of your own and direct a movie of your own. That's the whole point, not just taking scenes from a book and shoot them as they are.Second, the jokes. Gimli's one of my favorite characters. Why turn him into an idiotic buffon? Maybe because Jackson and his crew don't have a sense of humor? Gimli's jokes are pathetic and you want to strangle the guy sometimes. What a way of spoiling a good character.Third, the direction style sucks. It has no epic notions, no drama... A lot of the scenes are completely spoiled because of Jackson's idiotic focus on the special effects, completely forgetting the means he has at his hands to make as scene exciting. This p***es me off- a guy is given such a high budget and completely spoils it. The reason? Lack of talent.Finally the dream sequence with Arwen. Jackson is such a lousy filmmaker that he doesn't realize that he's shooting the dream in the same style as the rest of the scenes. This is a movie wich must be filled with an wonderful, magic atmosphere. Something that is from the beginning out of reality. How to make a dream in this context? It's an interesting question. But Jackson's answer is plain pathetic.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, slightly better than the first, but slightly overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I've read the books 1.5 times (i.e. I'm half way through)so I have a fair idea of pretty much all of the changes. This also makes my opinion slightly biased. This is also my first review here at imdb.com so bear with me.After waiting 8 more days than the Americans, I finally got to watch it and I wasn't disappointed (well, maybe a little). In general I think it's slightly better than the first, even though it wasn't as good as the Fellowship prior to Helm's Deep and the attack on Isengard. Although I haven't seen it enough (twice so far, I intend to see it once more) to make a complete opinion. although i think that the first one was more 'polished'.I'll skip the plot summary and just go straight to my opinion.Stuff I liked: *The Ent attack on Isengard, it was a bit short, but it was still great. Although I liked the flooding of Isengard, it was still obvious it was a miniature. The Ents overall were pretty well done, alot better than I expected, I expected them to look cheesy or lame.*The Nazgul with wings was also well done, although shots of just the nazgul, it was obvious that they just used blue screen. *Dead Marshes and Emyn Muil were perfectly visualised...*The Oliphaunts, almost exactly how I imagined them.*The Warg attack on the Rohirrim. One of the few changes that enhanced the story. The only complaint is that the wargs still looked a bit CGI-ish, especially when compared to the extremely well done Gollum.Stuff I loved: *Gollum/Smeagel is the best CG character ever. period. He is the first CG character that actually made me feel any emotion towards (does that sound right?). Every other CG character I have seen has been either soulless (Final Fantasy), retarded (Jar Jar, from Star Wars "The Phantom Menace") or not realistic enough (Jar Jar and Yoda and pretty much any other CG character that I can remember).*Gollum/Smeagel also did a terrific 'acting' job and was thoroughly convincing and realistic, unlike Yoda or Jar Jar. He was also very lovable and cute in a sort of pitiful and pathetic way, and I actually felt really sorry for him, something that has never happened with anyother CG character... Peter Jackons choice of accentuating the two characters (Smeagel and Gollum) was also a welcome change, as it made the arguements between them more dramatic.*Helm's Deep, completely epic and huge, although I have to admit its not quite as epic as the clone war in Star Wars "Attack of the Clones". I also have to admit they showed too much of the battle in the trailers, which sorta wrecked it for me. The constant cuts to Treebeard, Merry and Pippin also cut up the action in Helm's Deep, which wasn't a great editing choice.*Gandalf saving the day with Eomer, absolutely brilliant shot, even thought technically they would've been completely slaughter by the pikes that the Uruk-Hai were holdling (see: Braveheart).Stuff I didn't like: *Alot of the stuff I didn't like deviated from the book, although I don't mind minor changes, and I am in no way a tolkien "purist", I thought that Fellowship's changes were all good or excellent, except for the lack of Galadriel's gifts (although that was remedied in the extended DVD)*Near the ending when they were winding everything down, they shortened all the battles (Isengard and Helm's Deep) and cut them off and didn't really show the closing parts of the battle, it lacked the detail that they had at the beginning of the battles.*The movie seemed a bit 'all over the place' with about four plotlines to follow that weren't really edited correctly and didn't flow very well, for instance Merry and Pippin hardly get any screen time and as mentioned before they shouldn't have cut up the battle at Helm's Deep.*Didn't really like Aragorn's death, it was just an excuse to tack on the romance bits with Liv Tyler, which weren't very good to begin with, although I really liked the part where Elrond explains why the relationship is doomed to failure, showing Aragorn's death and all that.*The film probably focused a little too much on the plight of Rohan, rather than the ring, after all the movie is called "The Lord of the RINGS". They also neglected the Merry, Pippin and Treebeard story line and didn't include things that would have been of interest from the book, like Treebeards house and the Ent-wives.*The part where Aragorn and Gimili take on about 50 orcs on the bridge to Hornburg, that was completely unrealistic (even though it is a 'fantasy' movie)*Gimili constantly being used as comic relief. The last film used him only slightly for this purpose ("No one tosses a Dwarf!"), which was great, but this film over did it... Gimili constantly lagging behind, falling off horses, getting crushed and having his height ridiculed just weren't that funny and got tiresome very quickly. *The big eye above Baradur. It looked a bit too cartoon-ish *Legolas surfing on a shield. Complete cheese.Stuff I'm undecided on: *I'm still ambivalent to the character changes of Faramir. On one hand I understand why Peter Jackson decided to change him, but on the other I liked the idea that not every human could be so easily seduced by the ring.*The ents not realizing that the Isengard orcs were burning down forests until Merry and Pippin showed them. I understand that the main reason for changing this was so that Merry and Pippin would not appear to be completely useless, but it also compromises the fact that the Ents are among the oldest and wisest creatures in Middle Earth.All in all a solid 9/10, although I have to admit I am biased and probably would give it 8/10-8.5/10 if I wasn't a LOTR fan. I would also like to add, that I can't believe that the Fellowship and Towers are rated so highly, they are excellent movies, but they are also full of flaws, as mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic but not flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film moves the now broken fellowship further on their journey, but in the end it is as if they are no closer to Mordor. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and co. take centerstage, with Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) especially played humourously. While often good as light relief, his endless stupidity is annoying, and he really comes into his own at the battle scenes at Helm's Deep. This fight is epic - yet still only a taster of what is to come. It is perfectly planned by director Peter Jackson, and is such an improvement on the book's battle scene. There are new characters, but apart from one or two, none are lost from the first film. However, these new characters vary. All of the men of Rohan are bland and uninteresting - Theoden (Bernard Hill) is never exciting and the love possibility between Aragorn and Eowyn (Miranda Otto)barely explored. But one of the new characters is also one of the best. Brad Dourif's Wormtongue is a wonderful, slimy character who crawls between Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Theoden like the worm he is. His interest in Eowyn is also interesting, and unnerving. The special effects are truly stunning, although the first-time feeling of amazement is gone with this sequel. Highlights include the Black Gates of Mordor, pulled by trolls, and the Ents, which seem dignified as opposed to laughable, as they could have been. However the most incredible aspect of the film, by FAR, is Andy Serkis' Gollum. Far and away the most complex CG character ever, Gollum is actually one of the most human characters in the film. Every line, eye movement, hair is there, and Serkis' voice is wonderful. His movement and interaction with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) is fantastic. And we see his emotions. When he is called Smeagol, we see everything in his eyes and his voice. He jumps between hilarious, pitiful, untrustworthy and lovable. The standout scene of both LOTR films so far shows the two sides of his personality coming out and arguing - it is incredible. Gollum is absolutely amazing. The script has holes in - the director has clear favourite characters - Sam (who has a speech at the end almost identical to that in Fellowship), Gimli and Gollum among them. The dialogue sometimes seems too trivial. But TWO TOWERS IS AN EPIC. There is nothing that can change that, and it is spellbinding throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me say this right up front. Even today, with mainstream films getting ever longer, a near-180 minute film is pushing the envelope. When long films were more commonplace in the past, there was usually at least 1 intermission. That being said, This film kept me in my seat, utterly motionless, immersed in a flawless creation. Dazzlingly true to the story, continuity of the storytelling notwithstanding. I think any filmmaker would have to be crazy to go through nearly a whole story, then go back and describe the same timeline for another party. It would have felt like "Go" or "Run, Lola, Run". You don't need to be a Tolkein fan to appreciate this film, or the first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Nothing but praise for mr. Jackson. I think it was even more difficult to film The Two Towers than it was to film The Fellowship of the Ring, ´cause now there is no more pacing and building to be done. We are there. In the book, all the important stuff you could find in the narrative process. But this is not the book and Jackson isn´t Tolkien. But obviously he´s a great director. ´cause what he did here is marvelous and deserves only full respect and admiration. He transformed me into this beautiful dream and by the end, I could hardly believe that 3 hours have already passed. I read the book more than five times and I never suspected that there will be a superb movie adaptation of Tolkien´s magic.

The fighting scenes are awesome. Ive never seen a battle so epic like the final one. Supposedly the battle for middle earth is supposed to be even greater. I cant wait until the last one. Peter Jackson is making a fortune off of these movies. Supposedly he doesnt want to make anymore but you really think i believe that. With all that money id make fifty more. It could be like Star Wars with a prequel. The Hobbit would be the perfect set up. I really believe that in the near future that this book will come to life. The Samarillion is another story. Im not too familiar with this one but i believe it has something to do with Lord of the Rings. That would be a good story to bring to life as well. I would hate to see Lord of the Rings just end. Im sure because of how great the new movie did that Peter Jackson will not pass up on doing the Hobbit even though he says he wont. I always said talk is cheap. Bring on the Hobbit!</fullReview>

CGI was fine except for the trees where you could almost see the outline of Merry and Pippin (I don't care if I spelled their names wrong).

I am a dedicated fan of Tolkien, and LOTR in particular, and I believe that making the books into a movie was the most amazing challenge. Sure, Peter Jackson and his team had to leave things out, there was simply too much in the books to have it all included in the movies, but the movies are as close as they could be to Tolkiens original work. People should stop criticising masterpieces and start enjoying and appreciating them for what they are.....fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read any of the Lord Of The Rings books or "The Hobbit" either, but these movies have gotten me interested. I really hope I do, because it's hard for me to remember all the character's names, since like most names in fantasy stories, they're hard to remember.The plot has thickened more from the last movie, because it's now not just everyone in a group. They're in seperate groups, and I think its a cool concept how the scenes shift from group to group. The battle scene(s) at the end were a very worthy climax. I especially like the scenes where Gollum was "talking to himself". It made it seem like two separte people were talking, on how they shifted Gollum/Smeagle from scenes at different angles. Very clever. I can't wait for "Return Of The King".Although I'm kind of curious as how they were able to kill the guys and the hamster monsters they rode with just one arrow, it was still quite memorable. 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but no grrrll power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved a lot of things about this film, particularly the special effects (the realization of the trees, Gollum), and breathtaking shots like Frodo reaching toward the flying dragon--but couldn't Jackson have given us women ONE warrior? Eowyn, the supposed "shield master" never moves beyond fondling a sword...otherwise its "women and children down to the caves," while the men do the fighting. Even if it's not in the book, I know Jackson takes a few liberties when he deems it appropriate, and its hard to imagine that his co-writing wife doesn't get frustrated sometimes. This was definitely the most influential film of last year, beamed out to hundreds of millions of people all over the globe who seem to think the story line has contemporary relevance, yet it perpetuates an old-fashioned and helpless female image...even while chicks are on their way to the Gulf!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bigger and better in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>### SPOILERS ###I've just seen this movie for the third time, and it just keeps getting better. I always thought TTT would be the hardest book to adapt because of it's many different plot lines and position as the middle chapter of a very strongly linked trilogy. But Peter Jackson has done a sensational job, with the finished product far outshining any of my expectations.I loved the way Jackson chose to open the film, giving us a short reminder of a key scene from the first film then following it with a brief rundown of where each major character from the first film is, with some inspired editing helping this initial part of the film to flow much better.Of course with any adaptation of this magnitude some details of the story will always have to be modified, but some major alterations (e.g. Aragorn dreaming of Arwen after he's floated down the river, the distracting and unnecessary appearance of Galadriel) left me a bit confused.The acting once again is impressive all round. I particularly liked Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf the White. His added wisdom and austerity were spot on and I loved every scene he was in, particularly the one where he drives Saruman from King Theoden. However for me the best performance of the movie was from Sean Astin as Sam. His genuine, heartfelt portrayal of Frodo's loyal gardener, who would risk his life to save his mate, for me provided the most touching scenes of the movie which could have become fairly tacky in the hands of a less capable actor. The single line that defined his performance for me was after Sam has saved Frodo from the Nazgul and is thanked by having Frodo's drawn sword stuck in his neck, when Sam says "It's your Sam! Don't you know your own Sam?" That scene, and Sam's subsequent monologue totally defines the relationship between Frodo and Sam and in a way helps remind why their journey is the most significant in the whole trilogy. I think Sean Astin seriously deserves to be recognized in a few weeks when Oscar nominations are announced.All in all, this is a more than worthy follow up to one of the best movies of 2001, and an honourable adaptation of an awesome book. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`This grand epic ? this is the first film of the modern age that dares to dream a DeMille dream? a D.W. Griffith dream? a Kurosawa dream.' Harry Knowles ? Ain't It Cool NewsCertain films are born from a special source, from the deepest imagination, from dreams and visions. More than stories, they are icons of life itself and the experience of what it is to be human in our world. It is King Kong standing on the top of the Empire State Building, it's Errol Flynn coming down from a tree in the Adventures of Robin Hood, it's Gary Cooper in the middle of an empty city in High Noon. We can't explain it, but we recognize it in Gene Kelly singing in the rain, in Hitchcock's birds and Splielberg's flying bycicles. And we recognize it because they're the expression of what is of more intimate in human emotion, of joy and fear, of sorrow, of redemption...It is a dream I had, when I was young, that I would see Middle Earth with my very own eyes, someday. But for many long years, The Lord Of The Rings remained with a red stamp on the cover: `Impossible'. How could cinema breed life to the landscapes of Tolkien, larger than the horizon, or to it's talking trees, or to the largest and fearsome battles ever imagined by an author. And while we waited, hidden as the One Ring lost for centuries, the myth took shape. In the New York subway walls someone wrote `Frodo Lives'. And the dream grew in silent whispers, in the paintings of John Howe and Alan Lee, in unknown fan clubs and the dedicated imagination of millions of readers. Peter Jackson embraced this myth and attempted to translate the iconography of Middle Earth into the big screen. The final result is overwhelming, the product of impressive dedication and effort, incomprehensible to those who do not share the love for fantasy. But there it is, from the projector light, that all the beauty and grandeur of this ancient world comes to life. Here are Tolkien's themes, the corruption of absolute power, the value of friendship, the inevitability of growth, the strength of hope. Here we are, launched in the eloquence of a long journey of discovery through the deepest of ourselves, recognized in Gandalf's immortal words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the future, and have a part to play in the destiny of all.This is the Middle Earth, a place that lives in that world of dreams created from the same fabric of The Wizard Of Oz and Peter Pan. It is the hobbit Frodo in the world of darkness facing an eye of fire, it is Gandalf surrounded in light leading an army charging thousands of Uruk-Hai. It is a landscape that breeds, timeless, that makes us dream. Because we have all been there, in our childhood, when we were afraid of the dark or believed we could fly. Cinema, the great cinema, is not the rollercoaster we embark on with a bucket of popcorn. The greatness of cinema lies in Gollum's conflict, in our ability to believe that this being massacred by the greatest of torments can still find peace, even though we know the inevitable. And how it is great, how magical, that this ingenuity remains and is alive today in the movie theater.It is a dream I had, that I would see Middle Earth with my very own eyes, someday. Lucky for me, that in the movies, sometimes dreams come true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but slightly inferior than The Fellowship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, a great movie, IMO the best of 2002 (not a great year for films, anyway...). Jackson is a real genius because he has taken a fairy story, that could mean nothing to the average guy, and has created a visual world around it, so wonderful and surprising that you're always wondering what you will see in the next minute. It's not only the special effects: the landscapes of New Zealand provide some of the most awe-inspiring scenes. The golden rule of Jackson is: when nothing very interesting happens, give something very interesting to see.This rule is broken a little in the second hour, where the story goes on details without being very involving; there, for me, The Two Towers failed the perfect performance of The Fellowship (3 hours without a look to the watch!). But the last hours, with the two battle at Helm's Deep and Isengard, is the greatest visual experience of the year.In this instalment, the most psychologically-complex character is introduced: Gollum. It is funny that a CGI creature could be more human than humans (Yoda immediately comes to mind). Gollum is destroyed by the power of the ring, but a part of him still hopes that other people's love and respect can redeem him. Gollum is so convincing because a real actor played his part, and CGI is superimposed on his body. This improves also the performances of Frodo and Sam, which don't seem to speak to themselves, as Obi-Wan talking to Jar-Jar. I don't think you can win an Oscar without ever showing your face, but I hope Andy Serkis will get a special award for his peculiar and wonderful performance.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sigh. Since I was a kid, I've been waiting for someone to do a really great adaptation of the Lord of the Rings. When Fellowship of the Rings came out last year, I thought "this is it! Finally!" After seeing The Fellowship, I thought I was right...the movie I'd waited for was finally here. So, when I went to see The Two Towers, I was totally shocked and dissapointed to see such a poor adaptation...indeed, save the names of the characters and the places, it has virtually nothing in common with the story JRR Tolkein wrote.Now, I know that certain liberties have to be taken with a book in order to make it a film...that's part of the territory and I accept it. But the rampant, wholesale changes made to key characters and plot elements in this film seem the work of someone that never even read the books, and has no respect for the story. Major characters were completely and utterly changed...not just little changes, but changes that were core to their development. Faramir, the noble brother of Boromir, is painted as little better than his brother. In fact, the whole capture of Frodo and Sam and the forcing of them to go to Minis Tirith is in direct contrast with his actions in the book. His nobility is gone, and for no discernable reason. The same can be said of King Theoden, who turns out to be an indecisive, weak and fearfull old man. Not so in the books, and again, there seems to be no real reason for the change. Worse still, the ents were changed, only attacking Isengard after being tricked by Merry and Pippin.These changes to major characters, in my opinion, hurts the story for no apparent gain. Tolkein fans will be dissapointed to see these changes, and will wonder "why" just like I did. The movie is visually stunning, and is entertaining. But it's typical Hollywood, glamor and glitz effects entertainment, with a weak story and less than inspried acting on most parts.Now, that being said, if there is ever going to be an Oscar given to a digital character, Gollum is that character. The Gollum in the movie is stunning...his debates with himself are the high point of the film, and truly inspired. This fact makes it all the more depressing that the director, who was able to create Gollum in such a convincing way, botched the rest of the film so badly.</fullReview>

Hard to describe such an enjoyable film but though it has a relatively simple plot, it has enough 'eye candy' to make it amazing. A fine piece of art from Peter Jackson supported with strong roles from Aragorn and crew. Refreshing to see a very good blockbuster that is not centralised around 'overexaggerated action' but incorporates memorable characters moments around the battles. In a league of its own compared with the usual mass produced high concept Hollwood trash. Well Done to the Kiwi's!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie The Two Towers is, chiefly because it is the exact opposite of its smashing prequel The Fellowship of the Ring, and yet the movie still delivers and much more! My opinion on both movies stands on an equal ground, because these two complement each other. The differences are very apparent, especially on second viewing: it feels less intimate, has much more action sequences, doesn't have the prequel's linear pace and progression, the emergence of an important CGI character, and overall has a much more perilous tone than the last.It is true that much has been left out or changed, even more so than the first movie. But most of the crucial events as well as tone &amp; movement is all there, and that is all that matters to me (this is speaking from a BIG fan of the book who has read many of Tolkien's works and understood much of Middle-Earth's lores).My instinct tells me to put a hold on all opinions until The Return of the King comes out, and then watch all three one after the other in the same day. We'll then realise at how AWESOME the trilogy is and marvel at its unimaginable scope. It is the only way the story can be enjoyed - after all, no die-hard fan of the book stops reading it when it gets to a certain part!Once again well done to Peter Jackson &amp; writers, the stellar casts, and all at Weta workshop for a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action packed middle to the LOTR saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers hits almost all the right notes in its adaption of JRR Tolkein's work to the screen. Starting with a fantastic scene straight off the bat, there is little doubt that this movie will be action packed and full throttle.This is a great middle section to the LOTR saga. Arguments can be made about how true it stayed to sections of the book and how the changes influenced the story, but given that the movie stayed internally consistent, these gripes are possibly misfired. In adapting a book for the screen changes are always going to be made - the important thing is for those changes to be consistent to the overall narrative as it appears on screen. In TTT's case, Peter Jackson has made changes that have arguably added to the picture.TTT has some of the greatest battle scenes shown on film thus far. Although shying away from the visceral reality of Saving Private Ryan, these battles are epic in scope and brutal to watch. These battles also avoid skewing into the "hero beats all" stereotypes that so many fantasy films enter into - each battle sees both sides take casualties, which sometimes include more than just the nameless rabble.The flaws in TTT are almost unavoidable given the adapted material. Firstly, it is sometimes disrupting to move from one of the story arcs (say Aragon, Legolas and Gimli's) to another (Frodo and Samwise's). Unfortunately the most important journey to the narrative in Frodo's and Samwise's journey to Mt Doom is also the least interesting to watch which also disrupts the enjoyment of TTT. The final problem is that none of the characters really seem to develop to the same capacity of FOTR; the exception here is Golum, who is the most memorable character contained within this sequel.That said, these are minor points. TTT continues the LOTR's epic scope and vision. With the Return of the King due out on Boxing Day 2003, TTT has set up the audience for an exciting and dynamic conclusion to this epic fantasy saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nerds with Swords!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit it ? I gave up reading J.R.R. Tolkkien's `The Two Towers' halfway through. The book plodded for me more slowly than the anthropomorphized tree in which two of its heroes spend virtually the entire story. Peter Jackson's film of `the Fellowship of the Ring,' though, made me wonder if I'd perhaps been too impatient with the trilogy. The furious intensity and imagination he brought to that film convinced me that I dug this stuff after all. But just like those guys who dress up in chain mail and hit each other with padded swords, `The Two Towers' reminds me why I've never really gotten into fantasy. All the extraordinary production values of the first film are there ? not surprising, as they were filmed at the same time ? but one suspects that this installment could easily be skipped without missing the larger impact of Tolkkien's universe. The problem is that the `The Two Towers' essentially amounts to nothing more than a pointless aside in the epic trilogy of swordplay and sorcery. As expected, we pick up with our friends from Middle Earth as we left them ? covered with Middle Dirt and speaking proper fantasy-inflected English, still questing to cast the One Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom. Along the way, hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamje pick up the dubious guide services of Gollum, a scheming creature who appears to be a CGI rendition of Willem Dafoe. The film culminates in the battle of Helms Deep, the last ditch survival effort of the race of men against the invading armies of Mordor. The scope of this spectacle flirts with the impressive, although anyone familiar with `Army of Darkness' will have a hard time suppressing a chuckle at the sweeping shots of armored ghoulies gurgling and yawning menacingly. The puzzling bit, at least to the uninitiated, is that by the end of the film everyone is pretty much in the same place they began, giving rise to the suspicion that Tolkkien was perhaps trying to stretch this whole business a bit further than prudence would dictate ? like introducing Vance and Coy on `The Dukes of Hazzard.' The film's cinematography is again breathtaking, but is left searching for material worthy of its scope. There's walking, riding (on both horse and tree), and even a bit of running, but little else to warrant the constant swooping cameras. After an hour or so, `The Two Towers' begins to feel more like a fantasy edition of National Geographic than a necessary middle chapter of what might work better as a two-part tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually splendid but otherwise disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alas, my opinion of The Two Towers is no different from that of The Fellowship of the Ring. In my review of that film I said that people who see it because they want to see Middle-Earth on the screen will be thrilled, and the same is true here: Tolkien's visual world has been brought triumphantly to life in Peter Jackson's films. Rivendell, Isengard, Orthanc, Rohan, Osgiliad, Helm's Deep, Fangorn Forest, the Dead Marshes, Mordor, all of it looks spectacular. Here are hobbits, wizards, Rangers, men, elves, dwarfs, Half-Elven, Ents, Ringwraiths, orcs, Gollum (a fully digital character, ? la Jar Jar Binks), even Sauron's Eye. The battle scenes are as exciting as any in recent films. Everything is drenched in generic medieval atmosphere, including lots of tangled, matted, filthy hair hanging down in people's faces. That's one good thing about this movie: It doesn't look like a sanitized, Errol-Flynn-as-Robin Hood romp; there is more than enough dirt to go around. (No chamber pots or outhouses, though, but then, there weren't any in the books, either.)It goes without saying that the film cannot be the book, and must be judged on its own merits. And in order to compress the book into a 3-hour film, compromises were, of course, inevitable. Still, those who hope for more than pretty pictures may well be disappointed. I didn't mind the elimination of whole sections featuring characters that don't advance the plot. However, if you are like me, and what you treasure is the elaborately wrought, intricately detailed story beneath the visual effects, you will find little of it here. The outline of the plot has been preserved, as how could it not. But gone is the leisurely, majestic journey of the books; this is a race, a breakneck dash through a fever dream. Those who delight in Tolkien's rich, textured, muscular dialogue will find little of it here; what the FOUR, count ?em, four screenwriters have replaced it with is flaccid, bland, and banal. What little of Tolkien's original dialogue remains has been moved around and chopped up so that it has lost most or all of its power. The great sweep and turning of the seasons, so much a part of Tolkien's story, is barely touched here, and then only by the scenery. Whole sequences have been rearranged or transposed, or entirely new ones invented, for no reason that I can fathom; I cannot see where the originals would have been less cinematically successful. Many scenes are embellished and baroque where Tolkien's simple and direct treatment was much more effective. Wonderful scenes of dialogue have been trimmed to almost nothing.About 20 years ago, the BBC produced a 12-hour radio serial of The Lord of the Rings. I was curious how these films would compare to it. It turns out that the radio version still conveys the true feel of Tolkien's story better than this attempt. It is also interesting to note that 12 hours of radio works out to 4 hours per volume, or only about an hour longer than the filmed LOTR is to be per film; yet the radio series manages to achieve a much more leisurely and measured pace, much more like the book. It is still the best dramatization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, Ruined by Glaring Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MANY SPOILERSI loved Fellowship of the Ring. I thought it was a classic film and a faithful adaptation of the spirit of the books. The Two Towers is beautiful, as was FOTR, but it contains several serious flaws that make this movie more frustrating than enjoyable. People appear averse to hearing a comparison of the movie to the books, so I will stick to criticism of the film. The most glaring flaws in the film are:1. The resolution of the battle of Helm's Deep is not credible. This is a major problem because Mr. Jackson has chosen this battle as the climax of his film. We see literally 10,000 orcs on the plain in front of the fortress. As they are about to breach the last defense, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and a handful of others ride out into the fray. At that moment, Gandalf appears on the other side of the army of orcs and charges in with what appear to be a couple hundred soldiers. Now here is the problem: in this situation, there is no way that Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas will live, and it doesn't appear that Gandalf can prevail given his limited numbers. Do 10,000 orcs, including hundreds of orc archers near Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, ALL turn around and face Gandalf, forgetting completely about Aragorn and crew? It seems much more likely that some orcs will fight Gandalf (and kill him: I didn't think he would make it past the spears set in the front line), while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pelted with literally thousands of arrows. Mr. Jackson, apparently unable to resolve this problem, fades the scene out. Not good enough. This is the climax of the movie and it is not believable. A fatal flaw for any picture.2. Because the battle of Helm's Deep is the climax, we must endure almost an hour of people preparing for that battle. They shuffle out of the city, shuffle along through fields, shuffle into the fortress, get some weapons, and just generally stand around. This build-up is too long. Though the battle itself is impressively filmed, it cannot support this much film.3. The Ents, creatures who take half a day to pronounce someone's name, who have stood silently in the forest for thousands of years, decide suddenly to wreak havoc on Isengard because they see thirty feet of burned treeline. This is not in character at all. Perhaps it was done this way to convince us that Merry has grown since FOTR. Character development is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of consistency in the behavior of other characters. This moment makes the Ents, and Merry, look silly.4. Faramir's decision to drag Frodo to Gondor does not resolve itself well. How does watching Frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convince Faramir to allow Frodo to take the ring into Mordor? If anything, he should conclude that Frodo is near the end of his rope and the ring should be in other hands.These problems make the film ultimately unsatisfying to watch. As a side note, all of these problems were caused by Mr. Jackson's decision to deviate from the books. Here's hoping ROTK stays closer to the writings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic, but with some unnecessary liberties.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So where to start. I'll start with the conclusion; Loved it. That is not to say I have no nits to pick. I'll get to those, but I just wanted to get it out of the way up front that I loved this movie, and it is a classic that stands far above the vast majority of movies. Now to the details.I thought "Fellowship of the Ring" was as good of a movie version of the as was possible. Every change that was made, every part that was left out, I could totally understand why it was done. I'm pretty sure I even agreed with all the changes. I can't say the same about "The Two Towers". It was a bit slow to get going, and the flow and pacing was not as good as it could have been. There were definitely far more liberties taken this time around than on "Fellowship". Again, I'm not against liberties in principle, and sometimes they're even necessary to make a story work in the film medium, but some of the changes from the book just seemed pointless and unnecessary. Never the less, I found it enthralling, and destined to be a classic. I'm sure I will go to at least a few more showings, and will buy the DVD on the day of it's release. I just hope Peter Jackson and company pull in the reigns a bit for the next movie and don't get quite so loose with it. I never questioned anything about the first movie, but this one did leave a few criticisms with me. Still highly recommended though. I wait eagerly for "Return of the King".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not true to the book as the first one, but a brilliant movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***I just saw it last night, so I'm still kinda shocked by how good it was! I expected a great film but this was...WOW! There are minor flaws (some scenes are cut somewhat brutally) but hey, it's not such a big thing as I heard some people say! As for the books, it's not as true to them as the first one (esp. Faramir) but the changes are great, and make a lot of sense (the only thing i didn't really like is how they force Gimli to be funny in some situationes esp. in the begining) Karl Urban is fantastic as Eomer (my favourite character in this one) as is M. Otto as Eowyn! I can go on like this for ages, but the bottom line is that this is by far the best movie of 2002, it is a master piece of cinema, and it made the wait for the final chapter a lot harder!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Note: Can be revealing*** Yes! The 'Rings' gang has returned; this time to pursuit not one gleeful mission but several. Peter Jackson's "The Two Towers" is a dashing masterpiece of visual dazzle. Jackson's remedy to increase the journey adrenaline was to top notch the senses of our eyes and gaze through the screen as if it were a radiant constellation. Thanks plenty to New Zealand's visual effects workshop, Weta, their extreme realistic imaginations strongly surpassed "Fellowship's" capability (for instance, the zoom-out phase of Saruman (Christopher Lee, respectfully) and the multitude of Orcs, or the illustrious struggle between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog and their descent down the vertical cave). The splendid creation of Treebeard and the Ents added to the spectacular visual puzzle, and their fight for survival was a landmark in this film. But it is Jackson's conception of the monster-like Gollum that will win it many film effects awards, because this shows the farthest a filmmaker has explored to clone the characteristics and movements of a human (a creepy one, however), and interact with real actors and sets. Yet, it wasn't just the groundbreaking eye magic that makes this film seem so worthy. Howard Shore's grand compilation of sorrowful, joyous, and romantic tunes eased our ears. Every time, Arwen (Liv Tyler) was ravishingly reminisced by Aragorn (action-packed Viggo Mortensen), her choirs of angels chirped like robins. And on another note, the fellowship of Aragorn, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) broke out into a pleasantly, achieving tune that would make up for all that musical banter, which took up half the books. Cinematographer Andrew Lesnie exceeded the sky's limit, as the picturesque views of the snow-capped peaks of the dusted, rusted hills provided insight to many minds into Middle-earth. Jackson's depiction of the Battle of Helm's Deep no-doubt was pictured as a fuss for society. This 40-minute clash with the Uruk-Hai included Legola's grand stunt, boarding down the steps on a shield catching gasps of surprise. But it was the union of Gandalf and the Rohan Riders, led by Eomer (Karl Urban) that captivated the audiences, as they drove their horses down a nearly vertical trail, colliding and passing through the Orcs. Yeah, Jackson did not meticulously scrutinize Tolkien's masterpiece to verify every movement done in the chapters, but it's Peter Jackson's story. It raved out eyes, our minds...our hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as a middle part of a symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, a wonderful adaptation of the middle part of the Lord of the Rings story. The first 5 minutes get the viewer back to tempo and tension of the first movie ending. What follows is an incredibly intricate weaving of the many story lines that together resonate as a true symphony.Smeagol/Gollum portrayal is breathtaking (and I do not mean the computer graphics). The slight change in the character of Faramir towards being more tempted by the ring is minor (since it only furthers a trace suggested by the book) and it works miracles. Frodo is fittingly shown as having a lot in common with Smeagol. The character interaction between Frodo, Smeagol and Sam tells us so much in so little space. All other members of the fellowship grow immensely too.If only there was more development between Gimli and Legolas. But since the extended version of the FotR gave more of this, I hope to see Gimli in the caves and making a deal with Legolas in the extended version or in the Return of the King.The ending of course-- I cannot suggest a better point at which to end the middle movie so I am not going to complain. I am glad that the movie really has the feeling of a middle part of the movie and that it does not try to work as a stand-alone story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy TTT, but it is nowhere near "The greatest flick of all time" as some have perceived it to be. Here's why.Why does it have to clock in at three hours plus? It's difficult to keep this guy enthused for what's, and let us be frank here, basically an action movie within a fantasy setting. Action scene after action scene and very s l o w bits in the middle disguised at character building. Even the climactic Battle at Helm's Deep, although finely executed, felt overlong in my book, a prime example of more being less. Films like Traffic and Magnolia require a three hour running time because these are complex character driven stories. TTT does not.Why non-fantasy buffs are looking forward to the four hour DVD extravaganza baffles me.The whole interweaving of plotlines that culminate in a grand finale, read: Star Wars,type of storytelling that is so pervasive in movies these days defies logic in this one. Are we to believe that Merry and Pippin are hopping along on this three for what must be a week? Come to think of it, Merry and Pippin were as pointless in the film as they were in the books. Nothing to do but to sit on Treebeard and express but one emotion, the "wide-eyed look of amazement".The Romance. One word. Forced. In there to keep the chicks happy too. And if Aragorn doesn't have enough troubles on his mind, why with fighting an assorted lot of Uruk-Hai, Wargs and Trolls and all, we just throw in an extra love-element for good measure. And finally, the film reeks of self-importance. That's why the Indiana Jones Trilogy is miles above LOTR in my book. Jones acknowledges that it's entertainment. It's doesn't take itself too serious. It winks at the audience saying " Come on, we're entertaining you so don't bemoan the flaws and errors in logic" and as a result you don't. This baby has *art* smeared all over it's smug face. Well it's not art, it's longhaired guys battling guys in rubber masks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather boring, just like its predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers.After watching the first Lord of the Rings, I wasn't expecting too much from its sequel. Thank goodness, because I didn't get much. These two movies have much in common. For instance, they're both extremely boring in parts and way too long.Sometimes I really enjoy long movies. But at times like these, when the movie is extremely slow, I want to fall asleep.The Two Towers has an extravagant beginning, though, in which Gandalf battles the gigantic behemoth Balrog. This scene was probably the most impressive in the entire movie, matched only by the battle of the Ents toward the end.The characters have all split up, and so the movie jumps from one to the next to the next without really following any particular pattern. It's almost random, and at times I was getting a little confused. One time I was wondering where the heck Gandalf had gone, but then I remembered that about an hour ago he rode off on a horse. Such is the way of The Lord of the Rings, and I'm beginning to believe that this series will never change.I am also quickly tiring of the way these movies try to `trick' the audience into believing a certain character is dead or has died, when its obvious that it hasn't happened. Aragorn goes over a cliff (but fell into a river and survived), and Merry (or was it Pippin?) is `trampled' by a horse (nope, we find out ten minutes later that he actually rolled out of the way!). But it's all in good fun, and I guess it's supposed to keep the movie tense. Which doesn't really work.The plot is the same as the first, but this time Frodo and Sam have aid in the form of Gollum. Within the first few minutes, I was tired of Gollum. He is a sickly little character, with an interesting schizophrenic personality, but an annoying and poorly generated character nonetheless.Story line is, of course, different than The Fellowship of the Ring, but I found it just as boring. There is so much going on, yet the movie somehow manages to nearly put me to sleep.The music is absolutely awful. I no longer appreciate Howard Shore's work. In the first movie, he thought up some excellent themes and I was impressed. However, in The Two Towers, several themes play over and over nonstop, which is EXTREMELY annoying. No new themes are created in this movie; instead, Shore takes snips of pieces from the first movie and puts them in this one, which makes for a lousy soundtrack. Sickeningly lousy. I can really say it hit rock bottom.Despite all these flaws, The Two Towers does have some excellent battle scenes, although they, too, are stretched far too long sometimes. Gimli, the dwarf, provides some excellent comic relief, and he basically pulled me through the movie. Character development is still poor, but better than the first.All in all, The Two Towers is exactly what I expected. Much like the first, it is a major disappointment because it is so boring, lacking in a good storyline, and just too flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good but not quite as good as FOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched the Two Towers and I liked it very much but it didn't floor me like the Fellowship did.There is a lot to like about TTT. It's truly epic, it's action packed, some of the battle scenes are simply breathtaking and the special effects are great (the CGI Gollum simply rocks).  TTT is probably the most difficult of all three books to film mostly because story splits into several separate lines. The resulting constant crosscutting is often annoying and momentum breaking. Also there are a number of new characters and there is simply not enough screen time to develop them. Same goes for many of the the plot lines some of which are VERY thin. (hopefully this will be partly rectified on the extended DVD). For example, I found the explanation of why Faramir lets Frodo go entirely unconvincing. BTW, there ARE some plot changes as compared to the book. Unlike other Tolkien fanatics ( I think I qualify as one having read the books several times a year for the past 10 years) I don't think they were excessive. Such changes are always necessary when converting a book into a movie. For all those screaming about too many changes, just compare TTT with something like the Three musketeers, the Count of Monte Cristo or any of the Disney adaptations and you'll realize that you really have nothing to complain about.However, I found that a couple of the new plot twists simply didn't work. The would be death of Aragorn is a prime example. The ploy there is EXACTLY the same as in the fall of Gandalf and it doesn't advance the story so why do it?Finally, some of the acting performances in FOTR (most notably Bilbo, Boromir and Galadriel) were so good that the new guys (such as Faramir and Theoden) simply pale in comparison. I wish they'd let Sean Bean play Faramir too - just make Faramir and Boromir twin brothers or use a bit of make up.As far as acting is concerned Gollum steals the whole show (huge props to Andy Serkis who played him). Anyway, despite its shortfalls TTT is a very good movie, more than worth the money to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TTT had a different feel than FOTR. Gone was the magic which accompanied the first movie. Yet, TTT was just as good in its own way. Of course, the movie didn't adhere strictly to the book, but that wasn't a concern for me. What was a concern was the quality of the movie itself. It didn't disappoint me in the least.*** Spoilers *** Among my favorate parts were Gandalf's battle with the Balrog at the beginning, Gollum's appearance (who could forget him?), the king's transformation when Gandalf expelled the "curse" on him, the look of disbelief on Wormtongue's face when he found out how massive the army was that Suraman intended to launch against the people at Helm's Deep to exterminate them, the Battle at Helm's Deep, the ents' reactions then they saw the cut-down trees at Isengard, the ents' wasting of Isengard...I could go on and on.Of course, there were flaws which kept this from being a perfect movie, but what movie has ever been perfect?I consider this, along with the first movie, by far he best I have ever seen in the fantasy genre. Maybe not the best of all time, but very good. Peter Jackson deserves a lot of kudos for creating these movies from what was once considered an unfilmable story.There's a lot to pack into the final movie, as the second movie ended at a point before the second book did. Perhaps the regulators won't allow the final movie to go beyond the length of the previous two. In view of that, PJ and New Line Cinema might benefit by breaking the final movie into two parts, each two hours or so long, in order to get everything in so as to not to rush the final part of the trilogy. One could be shown near the end of 2003, the other near the end of 2004. But, as that's unlikely to happen, I'll just wait a year in anticipation for the final movie, which should complete the trilogy. If the final movie as as good as the previous two, it will likely be the top or among the top trilogies ever to be put on film. Certainly the most popular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(MILD SPOILERS)"I found the added love story between Aragorn and the elf-girl to be pointless, as there was no kind of relationship between the two in the books."Get over yourself, and read Appendix A. Better yet, start with reading the book. 'Elf-girl' indeed.As to the movie, I can only say... WOW. I've read LOTR about five or six times in the past ten years, and I've dabbled into the lore of Tolkien quite a bit, and Peter Jacksons alterations are, to the contrary of what many purists say, merely trivial in the grand scheme of things. They do not detract from the story, they just make it more dramatic. See, in condensing a 1000 page book into 9-9.5 hours of movie, you're bound to have to spice some things up, and omit others:You don't have 50 pages plus 50 more in Appendix F to explain why the elves are leaving, and to justify it, hence they'd seem terribly obnoxious, if not cowardly, if they just kept heading west. Thus, they come to the humans' aid in TTT.Arwen and Aragorn get married in ROTK, and the audience would be pretty surprised at her arrival if she only showed up in act 4 of movie 3.Theoden King can't hurry off to Helm's Deep to bravely fight the Orc army while the Rohirrim peasants head off to Dunharrow - it's near impossible to explain on screen why the orcs don't just march past said Helm's Deep and sack Dunharrow. And you'd have even more cuts between various locations, confusing the uninitiated to great lenghts.Faramir is less nice than in the book because, in the book, he's as nondramatic a character as can be. Shows up, let's Frodo go. You can't NOT have Faramir, to stay true to the book, but you can't have him act exactly the same or you'll risk people falling asleep over the lack of any drama or tension in the whole encounter.Lastly, the movie ends just a bit before the book ends in order to avoid overcomplicating the story, and totally destroying the pacing of the narrative. 'Yay, victory, now, before the credits, let's march to Isengard and talk to two hobbits looting Saruman's warehouse, smoking Old Toby'. 'Lest the audience thinks the film is over, we'll have Sam and Frodo meet their last great foe before getting to Mount Doom, conveniently making Return of the King a 1.5 hour documentary on two hobbits walking slowly towards a volcano'.Not to mention that one of the major villains (Saruman), has to be disposed of somehow, and since the Scouring of the Shire would be the epitome of cinematic anticlimax, it's going to have to be done in Isengard, which adds even more importance to the other half of the Fellowship (who are, might I add, getting together with Merry and Pippin again) going to Orthanc, and seriously, you can't add all that to the end of a Two Towers movie, after the incredibly well done Helm's Deep siege. It just doesn't work.Everyone who says they know how to make a better screen adaptation than Peter Jackson, while keeping truer to the book, please write a screenplay, act it out with the help of storyboards, and time your effort. You'll get a 5 hour movie which would make maybe 50 million worldwide, theatrically.Wait for the Extended Edition, and wait for Return of the King before you pass judgement. All I can do for my own part is thank heavens for the genius of Peter Jackson et al. These movies are the greatest piece of cinema ever made, bar none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering how I saw the Fellowship of the Rings, fifteen million times (actually 9 times in theatres, millions of times on DVD), I had very high expectations when I went to see TTT. I have to say that it blew me away but like all wonderful things, it has some flaws. Thus, I put it on the same scale as FOTR, a very high rating of a 9.First, FOTR benefited because it was new, no one knew what to expect, and it was ingeniously adapted to incorporate the book very well. There were no major changes except the obvious cut of Tom Bombadil, and I think Peter Jackson made Frodo a much more likable character. All the characters were somewhat new or unknown (in the mainstream) actors. It was just a giant surprise and the world was VERY impressed.TTT is a continuation of FOTR so there isn't much more surprise anymore. List of the good and bad:GOOD: 1. Helm's Deep: simply awesome graphics, well put together and just amazing!!!!!! 2. Acting: everyone, even Elijah Wood, was very good. I give kudos to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, he was wonderful. Ian McKellen had a lesser part but he was good in the parts he was in. 3. As a movie, it flowed, had great music, and overall, it is a beautiful picture. 4. Okay, admit it, Orlando Bloom is simply beautiful!!! 5. Very good adaptation of the book.BAD: 1. The love scenes between Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler were ludicrous. It was ALMOST as bad as the love scenes in the Attack of the Clones (which was one of the year's worst movies). They just looked so awkward that it was PAINFUL to watch. 2. Faramir. Why change a very good character, who was supposed to be the opposite of Boromir? WHY??????? I was so disheartened by that character change. 3. Drags at points. Drags when there is no action and there is talking. Sometimes it doesn't, but most times, such as scenes in the Rohan castle, it really dragged on and on and on . . . 4. Fake deaths. Why pretend Aragorn died when we know he is the future king and must be in the sequel????????I've seen this movie twice so far. The first time blew me away, the second I saw at Washington DC's Uptown theatre. Apparently, Orlando BLoom was there at the first premiere of FOTR. I was so excited and spent the whole movie waiting for his scenes. I'm sorry! He is just so hot. So anyway, TTT will go down as one of the best movies, but like everything, it has its flaws. =) Legolas: "You're late." Smiles. "You look terrible."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the Middle 3 hours of a 9 hour movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this story is a daunting task for any director to approach. Yes, there are scenes missing. Yes, lines get switched around from character to character. Yes, Jackson does create scenes that Tolkien never even imagined. The stories in the movie don't even follow what's in the book at times. But, even through all Jackson's idiosyncrasies, like many of us, he is a fan of Tolkien and his books. All artists want to put their stamp on their creations. If we were in the same situation, we would've done the same thing.Now that I've gotten that out of my system I can talk about The Two Towers.We must remember that this is only the middle part of one long epic saga. Imagine yourself walking into the middle of a movie and having to leave before it is done. That is essentially what this film is. Peter Jackson is doing something here that has never been done in film history before. It is a continuation of a great adventure that has long been in the imagination of many Tolkien fans for the last 50 or so years.I knew even before this film opened that I was only going to get so much from The Two Towers. Aragorn beginning to assume his kingship, Legolas and Gimli setting aside their differences and becoming great friends, Merry and Pippen, though hobbits and little folk, finding the courage to stand against the growing dark forces, the Rohirram, the Battle at Helm's Deep, the downfall of Sauruman's army, the march of the Ents, Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, and Gollum leading them into Mordor. That is what I knew I was going to get in The Two Towers.To me, it is the evolution of these characters and how they all change from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Two Towers and eventually on through The Return of the King that carry this story. As we will see, all the characters I've mentioned won't even resemble who they were to begin with. They will all have grown.

		<fullReview>When I saw the first 'Lord of the Rings' (Fellowship of the Ring) film last year I was bowled over by the incredible visuals and set-pieces.Having just seen this new one, I can say that the visuals in this are even better and the action in simply breath-taking. The film builds slowly throughout its massive 3 hour running time to a gorgeous, huge battle at Helms Deep, pitting 10,000 Orkai (I think that's the correct spelling?) against hundreds of men and elves.The action in this film is well paced and the characters are developed further. On the big screen the whole film is a true spectacle to behold and one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.It's simple - if you haven't seen this yet, then go see it today on the big screen, you'll love it!10 out of 10 .. Peter Jackson - you are a genius Director!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this even more than the first one, the fight scenes are incredible, the new introductions are short, Gimli and Smeagle are hilarious. And even though its brief, you actually get to hear the orcs and goblins talking. Legolas move when they are fighting the warg riders is incredible when you see it. the Treebeard and hit ent's if i spelled it right are pretty good to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie, but hamstrung by a few details...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying that Peter Jackson has done an incredible job in bringing Tolkien's world to life. It truly is a special movie... the acting and directing are amongst the best you will ever see, and somewhat unusually for a movie with this much money behind it, the special effects add to, rather than detract from, the spectacle.However, there are a few details ('bugs' maybe?) that really annoyed me about the movie. When Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli are tracking the Urakai across the plains, the dwarf kept falling behind but by the next cut had miraculously caught up again. Then, when they encountered the horsemen, there were nowhere near 2000 of them; yet when Aragorn confronts the king, he claims that was their number. Finally, when the king rides out for his last stand, there are very few of his men left (especially in the scenes in the hall directly before they ride out) - yet once Gandalf and the rescue party turn up, more of them suddenly appear out of nowhere.The details that Tolkien put into his book are part of what makes the stories so great, and it disappointed me just a little that such obvious (to me, anyway) things were overlooked.Nonetheless, an awesome cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the first one, I loved the second one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I must admit, despite being an avid reader, I have never read any of the books. These movies, especially "The Two Towers" have inspired me to read "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" and "The Hobbit." Though I enjoyed the first movie, when it was over I was ready to leave the theater. With "The Two Towers" I could have stayed for another three hours. I was throughly engrossed in it and I think that the special effects were used to enhance the story rather than dominate it. The final battle scene was incredible. Many people commented on some of the flaws of the battle scene, I won't comment on them. I will only say that it was obvious that an incredible amount of detail went into creating a scene that is destined to become a Hollywood classic. I can't wait to see the final movie. Unlike Dune (by David Lynch), which was visually stunning, but difficult to follow if you hadn't read the book; this series has invested the time and the money to satisfy someone who hasn't read the them. And I will definitely read the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never so bored in the cinema since the Fellowship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first things first - I've never read any of these books. I tried to read The Hobbit when I was a lot younger, but it was just too much, and that's as far as I ever got with Tolkien's work. I went to see The Fellowship of The Ring, because my boyfriend wanted to see it and I thought that as everyone was raving about it I would have a look. I was bored out of my skull and said that I wouldn't bother going to see the Two Towers and that was the end of it. Anyway, The Two Towers came out and everyone was raving about it and my boyfriend wanted to go and see it and for a long time I told him I wouldn't go with him. In the end I felt sorry for him because nobody wanted to go along with him, so off I went last night in a positive state of mind thinking it can't be worse than the first one. But it was! Frodo (Elijah Wood) only ever manages one facial expression and all the characters just sounded as though they were parrotting the story straight out of the book for the benefit of all the Tolkien anoraks. About half way through, I bundled up my coat on the arm of my seat, got comfortable and had a sleep - I'm not exaggerating. True the film's special effects are great, but there is no feeling to this film at all to back them up. It just felt like one long cash in to me. Sorry to offend the die hards but the Lord of The Rings story does not make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how many users are heralding this film as the greatest of all time. It's filled with horrible dialogue, gaping plot holes and melodrama. This isn't a good movie, its just an expensive one. Without the expensive special effects, there would be nothing at all to compliment this movie on.Major spoilers follow:The Ents: Theres no end to the problems I had with the ents. First off, where the hell did they all come from when Treebeard shouted. Were there a hundred Ents waiting on the other side of the trees? And if so, why was Treebeard so shocked when he saw how many trees had been cut down. Shouldn't news of something like that have spread amongst the ents fairly quickly? If a large chunk of your town got blown up I'm sure the news would get around.Gimli: So how tall is Gimli exactly? Because the movie changed its mind several times throughout. At one point he was a head shorter than Legolas but the battlement scene had him significantly shorter than that simply for the sake of a joke. Jokes are another problem I had with Peter Jackson's use of Gimli. That's ALL he was used for, comic relief. Nearly every second of screen time that Gimli had was supposed to be funny. Why didn't they just give him a clown costume.This isn't the greatest movie of the year and it certainly isn't the greatest of all time yet for some reason its fighting for first on the top 250. Every time I ask someone why they thought it was a great movie I get mostly the same answers. "The special effects were great!" Yes, they were but special effects alone dont make a good movie. If you handed anyone three hundred million dollars I'm sure they could make a movie with good special effects but not neccesarily a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's so big let's beat up on it (for those who've seen it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no need to praise a movie that's currently #12 in the IMDB top 250 -- obviously it's a must see. You wouldn't miss it any more than you would the early Star Wars series (in it's time). So while I definitely enjoyed it, and while I agree with most of the praise re. the computer graphics (wow!) and also some improvement in the acting over FotR (especially Wood's Frodo -- but stop biting your nails, dude, that's a bad habit.) Still I did find some things disconcerting and detracting from the illusion of a sojourn to Middle Earth.Vaguely in order of ascending distraction:(NO PLOT GIVEAWAYS, BUT SPOILERS OF A SORT.)1. Too much panning -- I started feeling like I was on a merry-go-round. The camera never stops zooming hither and thither. Every character and every setting doesn't have to be shown from all angles. This is not The Matrix. Similarly, too much slow motion. And when is slow mo EVER good? (Except in The Matrix.)2. Too many long battle scenes. This was a defect of the trilogy itself also IMO. (Like many others here, I've read it twice.) Epic stories are about heroes not "history". They could have profited from studying Ben Hur, where battles are well meshed with story development. Anyway, to counter this impersonal aspect, they have all the main characters within shouting distance of each other in spite of the clamor, confusion and scale of the battle -- requiring another suspension of disbelief. And two wrongs don't make a right.3. Regarding abridgement, the 1st half was confusing. The fact that I read the books made some things understandable, and other things more confusing. The excuse for this, oft repeated, is that there wasn't time to clarify the storyline -- yet there was plenty of time for endless battle scenes which did little to further the plot.4. Re. Elven/human soft-focus face sucking, another lapse. Here, even a smooch is too much nevermind sticky lips and suspected tongue. It's not Tolkien, and it's not needed. This is about peaceful and brave little hobbits vs. monstrously evil and militaristic wizards. Females of Middle Earth are ethereal and distant and often have magic powers, or at least can weild a sword. You love them, you fear them, but you don't you-know-what them. This is supposed to be an escape from all that.6. Worse than lip gobbling -- a joke about dwarf tossing! God! Serious gaff. This is magical fantasy. Anything for comic relief? Fine, but don't jar us from Middle Earth into the 70's blue collar bar scene! Note: The Dwarves of Middle Earth are an ancient and proud race of their own. The last thing you want to do is link them with human dwarfism. Jeez. Get with the FANTASY.7. Explosives! I do not recall explosives in the book, though I admit it been many years since I read it. But this is Sword and Sorcery, not Sword and Chemistry. You see that thing go off? Tell me, if they knew the opposition had high explosives, would they have been yapping about their great Keep? It raises all kinds of questions. Why didn't they lob the explosives into the keep with catapults, or have the black riders drop them from 6000 feet? For that matter, why didn't Saruman just manufacture cruise missiles instead of those moronic Evil Dead part II look-alikes (and where'd they get those growling sounds -- an old Tarzan movie?)End of gripes.Star Wars had problems too. And of course there will only be 3 of these, so we don't have to worry about it hanging around the movie industry like a millstone for the next century -- right? Right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gonna start off by saying, this is without a doubt the greatest movie I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned when Peter Jackson got handed the ball to make these movies, he not only ran with it, he won the super bowl. This is one of those types of movies that you hear of from ur grandparents, such as the Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, yet teenagers also will enjoy this film. I am only 18 and, God willing, have many years left in my life, and I doubt I'll ever see a movie this well done again in my lifetime. The first one itself deserved the best picture oscar and lost (somehow to a beautiful mind) this one doesnt deserve it already owns the best picture oscar. Every single actor, or actress, in this movie are amazing actors. Ian, Elijah, Viggo, Sean, Billy, Christopher Lee, Orlando Bloom, and a surprise Brad Douriff, who did one hell of a job. To make it simple. This movie rocks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the Middle 3 hours of a 9 hour movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this story is a daunting task for any director to approach. Yes, there are scenes missing. Yes, lines get switched around from character to character. Yes, Jackson does create scenes that Tolkien never even imagined. The stories in the movie don't even follow what's in the book at times. But, even through all Jackson's idiosyncrasies, like many of us, he is a fan of Tolkien and his books. All artists want to put their stamp on their creations. If we were in the same situation, we would've done the same thing.Now that I've gotten that out of my system I can talk about The Two Towers.We must remember that this is only the middle part of one long epic saga. Imagine yourself walking into the middle of a movie and having to leave before it is done. That is essentially what this film is. Peter Jackson is doing something here that has never been done in film history before. It is a continuation of a great adventure that has long been in the imagination of many Tolkien fans for the last 50 or so years.I knew even before this film opened that I was only going to get so much from The Two Towers. Aragorn beginning to assume his kingship, Legolas and Gimli setting aside their differences and becoming great friends, Merry and Pippen, though hobbits and little folk, finding the courage to stand against the growing dark forces, the Rohirram, the Battle at Helm's Deep, the downfall of Sauruman's army, the march of the Ents, Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, and Gollum leading them into Mordor. That is what I knew I was going to get in The Two Towers.To me, it is the evolution of these characters and how they all change from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Two Towers and eventually on through The Return of the King that carry this story. As we will see, all the characters I've mentioned won't even resemble who they were to begin with. They will all have grown. We fans, who have watched from the beginning till the end will have felt like a part of this growth. That is the beauty of this film. That is what Peter Jackson is trying to accomplish.I believe it is an injustice to judge a movie until you've seen it all. This movie is not yet finished. It is only after The Return of the King that I feel any comments, reviews, awards, criticism, or anything of that sort, will be justified.

		<shortDescription>Very Gross at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was surprisingly gross at times. The scene when they are breaking 2 little rabbits backs is nasty. Another one the disgusting Golum slaps fish on rocks. The scene with a stack of burning bodies is disgusting and the director keeps showing the scene over and over. Most directors show something uncomfortable and move on. This one keeps pounding uncomfortable shots over and over again.This film is not for young kids though Lord toys are surely marketed to them. Golum is terrible to look at and creepy to hear talk over and over again. He is an almost Holocaust type image that hurts the film. The film is far more brutal and dark than the first. Nothing really draws the audience in and it can be confusing and revulsion is too common here.In conclusion, though, the final hour is good with a lot of intensity in the battle scenes. The last hour makes the film worth seeing. I liked the first film better over all but these battle scenes were excellent in the final hour but it did cut away from them too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you expect if you are going to watch The Two Towers? A perfect literature adaptation? A perfect action loaded fantasy-epic? A role-play-like character-development-story? It is none of that. It is the perfect synthesis of all. This movie combines all you can imagine in Tolkiens fantasy world. It is Tolkiens world. It describes the pessimism of all inhabitans in middleearth, the pure evil that would destroy everything. And the one, who can turn everything into light.Of course, it is not perfect. There are literature sequenzes, which you can not adapt to a film. Who wants to see a scene taking hours of discussion - like in the book - with Theoden and Gandalf about the fate of Rohan? Within this scene, Peter Jackson improved as well as in other scenes.There can not be a discussion about the special effects- they are genius. But all those effects just help to tell the story. All characters loose something, just like within the book. In others- Jackson and his writers did not improved well. There is a plenty of work to do within the TWO TOWERS, but we did not see the last third of the book. But what we had to see is a redundant dying of characters and a love story, which is absoltuly unnecessary. To cut a long story short - unimportant. All in all this film is a phenomenon. It is worth to see for people who love the book, and people who never read it (but saw the first part!). It can not fulfill the fantasies of readers who see a mistake where a film cannot adapt a book. But this film is a cineastic storm- it affects you even if you are attached to your glass of water.</fullReview>

Gollum was very well done, and the character development and interactions were much better here than in the first movie.I didn't mind the fact that certain changes had been made. For example, I was pleasantly surprised that Arwen was given more of a role and was generally a better developed character in the movies. Also, I thought it was a fun and interesting addition to have Elven warriors show up for the battle of Helm's Deep and it was perfectly believable within the context of the story. I was less impressed with the addition of the battle with the orc riders where Aragorn is presumed dead, but I didn't mind too much.What actually really bothered me was the dramatic change in Faramir's character. In the book, even if he is momentarily tempted by the Ring, he never attempts to force Frodo to follow him to Gondor or anywhere else. He's different from his brother Boromir. I was very disappointed by this alteration. Faramir is one of my favorite characters, and I felt he was unjustly portrayed.I was confused as to why the movie did not end with Frodo presumed dead in Shelob's Lair. If the added bit where Faramir goes out of character were to be removed, I'm sure there would have been space for Shelob.The Ents weren't quite as I imagined them. I always thought they were much thicker. However, that's simply quibbling. The altered Ent Moot and so on was not a big deal, and it was too bad there were no Hurons at Helm's Deep, but I didn't really feel that loss either.Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable adaptation. The images, sounds, and character interactions were very impressive, and the battle scenes were a lot of fun. I just wish Faramir had been more fairly portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shall I describe it our should I get you a box - Legolas (Helms Deep)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone seems to have many great and not so great things to say regarding this movie. Like most anybody else after FOTR I was left with an intense wanting for the movie to continue. Even after my butt went numb from sitting in that theater seat for 2 1/2 hours. Most people must understand that the first film was of building the characters so that non LOTR fans would be able to understand the second and third films.That being said, Holy cow, this movie truly was amazing. I am of the same belief that Legolas should not have done the XXX (movie) Tony Hawk shield slide down the stairs. Gimli's comic relief was welcomed on the lines regarding running across country and the line regarding being tossed by Aragorn. It tied the stairs scene from FOTR. They could have left out the part where he falls off the horse and the "shall I describe it our should I get you a box" Those were not needed. Well maybe the horse one helps explain why he always is riding shotgun.Well Gollum was a special effects AAA+++. The only flaw was in the fight scene with Frodo and Sam when Gollum spins on the blanket. It just looked staged. But other than that Gollum should be nominated for his spilt personality arguement scene. That was hilarious and explained Gollum to the new LOTR fan very well. So how about that Helms deep battle. Is it just me or did Peter Jackson really like seeing heads being whacked off in these movies or what. Ok how many others out there thought that when they saw the Ent with his head on fire and plunges it into the rushing dam water thought it gave you a flashback to Micheal Jackson and the Pepsi commercial from the eighties where his hair caught on fire.Merry and Pippin really didnt get much in this movie but they'll get there chance in ROTK later this year.My hats off to the score for both films. I own both and they are fantastic. Look for the London symphony orchestra they have a CD with music inspired by the films. But if I were rating score alone the FOTR was better. The Hobbit tune is great. But then the Gollum song on TTT was wickedly dark and exciting.Well I have seen TTT 9 times since it opened and will probably see it at least half a dozen more before it leaves the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike the last Tolkien film Jackson made, on this one, he doesn't adhere to the "show, don't tell" principle, and there are numerous (and rather annoying) ad-libs and editions to the plot. Without attempting to sound too much like a Tolkien fanatic, I have to take issue with a few parts (which, while not disturbing the main plot threads, nevertheless change the tone of the overall story) ... so, if you haven't seen it, stop reading this now:Okay, people who haven't yet seen it looking away? Hey, a few of you are cheating - so look away already ...- The trip to Helm's Deep, after the evacuation of Rohan - there was no battle. It seemed less like an interesting plot addition and more of a ham-fisted attempt to make the show more exciting (which is, quite honestly, unnecessary - the story is already pretty damned interesting).- The changes in characterization of Sam and Frodo were also rather unnecessary. Sam and Frodo both understand Gollum's true nature, and while tolerating him - neither trusts him - and the film fails to reflect their accurate understanding of the broken and unredeemed character that Gollum is, in pursuit of some mealy "everyone can be redeemed" moralizing. Get over it. Some are evil by design, some by accident, Gollum happens to be one destroyed by his own moral weakness - and the film fails to accurately convey that. Frodo is also not so much seduced by the power of the ring, but more driven to despair - he is pure in spirit, but the nature of the ring begins to corrupt and destroy the hope that he brings with him - the very hope that will see him through the bitter end. His apparent willingness to surrender the ring to the Nazgul at Osgilliath (who thought that one up, anyway?) is completely bogus, and does not properly reflect Frodo's true nature - the humble servant, charged with an almost impossible task, but willingly accepting of his duty, and willing to see it done, despite what it may cost him.- As for Faramir - again, the screenplay fails to accurately convey that he is quite different from his brother; his brother was ambitious and proud. Faramir is humble and honourable - he knows what must be done, and is not arrogant like his brother, who assumed that the power of the ring could be turned against its master - a mistake which cost him his life. Tolkien generally does not allow his characters a morally ambiguous fate, and by portraying Faramir as cut of the same cloth as his brother, it opens the possibility for him to be similarly corrupted by the same thing, and eventually to suffer the same fate. This is quite simply not true, and to do so would ruin one of the finest of Tolkien's characters, and distort the story.- The Ents, too, are never unsure of what must be done; they understand their fate, should they fail to act, and they recognize that they, too, must struggle against evil, even to a bitter end. The cheesy pseudo-green moralizing is an irritating distraction.- The sappy love triangle between Eowyn and Aragon is pointless, and smacks of the kind of phony romanticism that has made Hollywood famous.However, I will say that those complaints notwithstanding, the film still manages to come together quite spectacularly - especially the battle of Helm's Deep (the appearance of the Elves aside). Jackson manages to portray very well the almost insurmountable odds the people of Rohan face, and their courage and indomitability even in the face of certain death.So ... on the whole, a decent job - but not as good a depiction as the first installment. I sincerely hope that the screenwriters don't take further liberties, and create an ambiguous mish-mash of cloying sentimentality and cheap aphorisms for the sake of a bigger audience. I think it rather presumptuous for screenwriters to assume that they can tell a better story than one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than FOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very difficult to imagine the task that lay ahead of 38 year old Peter Jackson, when we went off to simultaneously film all the LOTR entries. It is amazing that anyone would green light a $300MM project like this. FOTR was nearly perfect and TTT is even better - a masterpiece if I may use a tired word. JRR Tolkien gave us this world, and Peter Jackson has brilliantly brought it to life.In every measure I can name, this film is equal to or superior to its predecessor. Effects, dialogue, battles, action, intrigue, and of course Gollum. The battle of Helm's Deep, which occupies most of the third act of this film, is tour-de-force. Every computer generated character is believable and there are more kills on the battlefield than in Braveheart.Special mention must be made of two of the CGI characters. Gollum is perhaps the most fascinating creature I have seen. Pathetic and sympathetic, repulsive and lovable all at once. The best scene takes place when Gollum converses with his evil self. The other is Treebeard, the wise Ent, the shepherd of the forest, a talking tree that rises to battle to defend and avenge his brethren. The scene where one of the battling Ents dunks his head in the flood waters to extinguish himself is one the films great moments.You can argue until you are blue in the face whether or not this is true to the book. That's irrelevant. We are fortunate to be witnessing a trilogy that will be regaled as one of movie history's key events. This is the only sequel in recent memory that surpassed its predecessor at the box office, which is proof of the fact that it is a better, more engaging and more entertaining film. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should say that definitively this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters, the story, the place, everything is perfect! I've never read before some of the books but after watching the movie it has motivated me to read them. I'm 16 years old and Legolas is my favorite. I think Orlando Bloom isn't just a very good actor also he has a gorgeous, and attractive face. I first saw him in The Lord Of The Rings, and love him since then. I'll always love this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolkein traditionalists please shut the hell up before I beat you!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film student and a Tolkein fan I loved this movie and almost everything about it. Peter Jackson really does understand what he's doing. For all those who say that this film made too many changes from the book, this is all I have to say to you: go cry me a river. It's an adaptation for the love of God, it's not supposed to follow the story exactly.Most of the things that were changed in this film were changed with good reason. As much as I love Tolkein and his writing, he does tend to meander with his narration to a point that I sometimes wonder if Treebeard is supposed to be the one narrating these books. Additionally, alot of information in the books is conveyed through dialogue instead of through action and visuals, which is a big no-no in film, and not a great idea in storytelling in general. Therefore, Peter Jackson created some new ideas that got the same story across only more visually. Yes, he changed alot, but all of the new stuff still accomplished the same thing as the books and still got the THEMES of the story across.Yes, there were changes that p***ed me off. Faramir is supposed to be the good brother and that bothered me because it was a complete change of a character, not just of the story. As far as the whole Arwen thing goes, I'm not happy that they made the decision to blow up her character and all, but I like the way they did it once the decision was made. It could have been done a lot worse, with her following him into battle and trying to be a lovey dovey, turning this into another Titanic/Pearl Harbor. At least they stuck to things that actually DID happen, albeit in the appendicies.</fullReview>

The battle at Helm's Deep contains copious blood-spilling and incredible special effects, making the audience believe beyond all doubt that 10,000 orcs are beseiging 300 weary warriors. In actual fact, most of what is on screen in computer enhanced, but it looks and sounds so much like a real battle that it's impossible to spot the difference.The performances are uniformly excellent. John Rhys-Davies, as Gimli the dwarf, seems a bit too broad and plays the part slightly too much for laughs. However, the rest of the cast rise to the wonderful script, etching out memorable performances.

		<shortDescription>A waste of money or the dawn of an epic Trilogy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must start by saying, that at the end of this review you will get two ratings from me. One for the first time I saw the film (December 19th) and a second one for the second time I saw it (January 12th). I watch films like this (and Star Wars films) two times in the cinema, because I feel that I am too overwhelmed by the visuals at the first time to really capture the whole film. Another reason, why I do not enjoy The Lord of the Rings as much at my first view, is that I've read the books. This means that I (while watching the film) start wondering how they've done this and that and ask myself: ?What came next?'. This of course prevents me from ?getting deep into' the film, but unlike other films it does not totally spoil my viewing experience. The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers (together with a limited number of other films) are the only ones, that can make me shed a tear, even when I'm not that able to plunge ?into' the story.After the big success and the quality adaption, that The Fellowship of the Ring was, the expectations for the Two Towers were enormous. Not only for the general public, but for me also, even despite the fact that I thought that The Two Towers was the ?worst' book of the trilogy ( with The Return being just a notch better than The Fellowship of the Ring). I obviously cannot say yet, that The Two Towers is my least favorite film, but what I can say, is that it was not as good as the first film. This has nothing to do with the actors (even though Ian McKellen isn't as great as he was in The Fellowship of the Ring), the effects or the story. Contrary to what some might think now it has also nothing to do with the fact that Peter Jackson added a few scenes,left some out and even delayed the appearance of Shelob until the last film although it has something to do with the ?artistic freedom' Peter Jackson permitted himself in making this film. The only thing that really ?bugs' me about this film is (and I know I'm going to sound like one of those idiotic Tolkien freaks) that it did not quite grasp the essence of the book, of the whole trilogy for that matter, for The Lord of the Rings is basically about Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring of power in the fires of mount doom and it is my opinion that this part of the story did not get enough attention throughout the film. While I was reading the book, I could fully understand Frodo's difficulty with the ever heavier growing ring, that started to poison his mind and caused a lot of struggle within Frodo. A struggle in which he was all by himself, for nobody knew what it was like and nobody could help him bear this ever growing burden. Peter Jackson (obviously) tried to bring that part of Frodo's feelings onto the screen, but in my eyes he failed. The terror of the Ringwraith's and the inner struggle within Frodo were much better depicted in The Fellowship of the Ring than they were in this film despite the fact that it was an essential part of the 2nd book of the trilogy. Now I know that this film has been cut (as The Fellowship of the Ring had been) to reach a wider audience and to earn back the BIG bucks that were invested in the making of this trilogy, so I can only hope that Peter Jackson cut essential parts out of the film instead of forgetting to forge a good second chapter of what is and could become an epic and classic trilogy on paper and on film respectively.Oscars for: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best MakeupNominations for: Best Cinematography; Best Picture; Best Director; Best Writing; Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing; Best Sound; Best Editing; Best Effects, Visual Effects and Best Costume DesignOne ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all?and in the darkness bind them.1st view: 7,5 out of 102nd view: 7,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liked the first film and was looking forward to the second installment. When I first left the theatre I thought it was a good film but slowly as I pondered through the film in my mind I amfraid to say that it wasn't that good. I know this goes against a lot of the comments but I can only speak my mind.There are several little niggly pieces in the film but the last straw was when the "hereos" rode out into Orcs from Helms Deep......man that was just too much.10 riders against 1000 Orcs and not a scratch on any of them. I know he has to follow the book but that was way too much to stomache.Please get a bucket.I will still buy the DVD but I won't be awaiting the release date as I was with the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lord of the rings the two towers is one of the greatest fims in my book for the outstanding amount of effort that has been put into it! The computer graphics that were input to the film were just mindblowing! Including the firey pits of hell, the walky talky trees! (this was really cool by the way!), the soldiers of doom, the kingdom in which they stand, the fields in which they crawl, just simply everything!  The character of Aragon is also much better developed than the first film, proving him to be more heroic and somewhat the strongest. Frodo is still pretty much the same from where we left him, although at times is more confident and tougher a cookie than before! Sam is still as big a twit as he was to begin with...... but don't you just love him??????The two hobbits are also a bundle of laughs at times, with a sense of sympathy among them for being so defenseless. The return of the king i expect will only give out 10 times more than what it has in the second film, but until we see it, all the respect in the world to Peter Jackson for an outstanding direction!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent! The acting is really good again, and the graphics are heaps cool! But if you haven't see "The Fellowship of the Ring" or haven't read the books, you will be seriously lost watching "The Two Towers".The second movie begins right where the first left off, with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his sidekick Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are making their way to Mordor to destory the Ring. The scenery is pretty much the same as the first - in fact, pretty much everything is the same apart from the story and the fact that this movie doesn't focus so much on Frodo but on Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies).The fight scenes are also realistic and the costumes are great.Basically, if you loved the first film, you'll probably love this one too. It's very cool!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROBABLY SOME SPOILERS IN THISI enjoyed the first film. Plenty of action, plenty of character development, plenty of emotion, some fantastic NZ scenery. Saw TTT, though, and thought it was, by contrast, incredibly poor. I wasn't expecting anything life-affirming but I was expecting another good, well-made movie. Again, there was great scenery, and the NZ tourist board must be rubbing their hands. But as for the film...This was, essentially, a long middle part of another film. Whilst this could be expected, the clearest comparison that can be drawn is the Star Wars films, with certainly the first-released trilogy each forming great films in their own right. This was not the case with TTT.As far as characters went, there was no discernable development other than Gollum. I enjoyed his little ramblings, and thought he was very well done, if slightly comic book in facial appearance. We learned absolutely nothing about anyone else of value. Aragorn was just about the only character with whom I felt any kind of empathy (well, I would say that, wouldn't I). Frodo spent more time in a badly-acted trance than he did communicating (I understand the ring was taking him over, etc etc, but how often do we need telling?). Gandalf was disappointing, Saruman weak, Sam good (he's supposed to be annoying) but underdeveloped, Legolas acting like he was from Legoland, and demoting Gimli to light relief was a shame. New characters like Theoden and Grima were assiduously kept on one level.The plot was, well, not strong enough to make the film stand on its own. Perhaps it could have been, but I got the feeling that we were being blasted with special effects which, whilst very impressive, almost seemed to be trying to mask the fact that the storyline itself was too slow-moving and didn't contain enough to keep us interested unaided.And aside from all this, there were so many elements to the film that were plain ridiculous that I actually left the cinema laughing. The giant tree things. Incredible. I know there's a certain suspension of disbelief required here and that they are a vital part of the story but, despite looking good and being in some visually interesting scenes, these too looked like comic characters. Reminded me of the rocks that come alive in, I think, Return to Oz, but the rocks were much darker and struck a more appropriate tone. The trees just reminded me of my grandad (yes, he was forty foot high and covered in moss) and their transformation into destructive forces capable of bringing down Saruman's gaff was then too far-fetched.And so many cliches it wasn't true. From the painfully obvious pathetic fallacy of the rain at the start of the battle for Helm's Deep to the cringe-worthy appearance of Gandalf on shining steed bringing light to battle against the forces of dark at daybreak. And then leading a handful of blokes into battle against a massive army of really quite vicious creatures, and apparently trouncing them, is a bit beyond belief. Could we not have seen the battle? Did they run short on budget? I personally would appreciate a chance to see such an apparently incredible feat. And instead all we get is five of the main good guys sauntering over yet another hill crest to observe, 'Well, that was a job well done, but the really BIG stuff is going to happen in the next film.'Thanks.So I thought this was a waste of time but I'll still look forward to the final installment because I'd love to see how Jackson ends this. I suspect that the outcome could well have been a heavily-edited down 4 or five hour single film instead of a protracted 9 hour trilogy, but I'm still keen. As for this one, I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far better than Lord of the Rings which is a mighty achievement. The special effects are outstanding but the most memoriable experience from the movie is being able to sit back and go back 5000 years to a previous world inhabited by hobbits, wizards, elves, orcs, dwarves and a variety of others and believe that you are there. The movie is full of humour, drama, passion, despair, exhilaration and a variety of other emotions. The scenery is magnificent, the music wonderful, and the movie achieves more than any other film I have seen the ability to totally immerse you. I have seen it twice and want to see it again!Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few movies that lived up to it's hype. The battles are great and well laid out to keep you caring about the people. They keep a nice pace to keep you engrossed in what will happen next. (It took nearly 45 mins before I could find a place I could run to the bathroom for fear of missing something good). It's well acted and directed, and the special effects are top notch. I've seen it 3 times just to soak in the depth of the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legolas rocks, plain and simple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was so so so much better than the first one! I found the first book in the series to be rather boring anyway, as it was simply setting up the story line. The Two Towers is when the action finally comes into play, and boy was there a lot of action in the movie! There were a few more changes made to the story line in this one than there were in the first one, but for the most part they seemed to work, although I didn't think they were really necessary to the flow of the story. But what do I know, I'm no Peter Jackson. All I know is my eyes were glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie. I thought the devastatingly handsome Orlando Bloom as the ultra bad-ass elven assassin Legolas carried the battle scenes with a sleek finesse that is unusual to supporting actors in an epic action/adventure. The audience in the theater was gasping with astonishment at every light footed feat he performed. This was a beautiful motion picture that left me breathless. I WILL pay 9 dollars to see it again, and perhaps again after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, confusing, and highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to name the most overrated movie, this would be it. While it features some nice eye candy, it falls totally short in the plot.I can imagine that this movie may have some interest, if you have read the book. You may recognize bits and pieces you remember and have some fun comparing the visualizations with the way you imagined things. And as in the first part, some of the scenery is breathtaking. But aside from that, the movie is simply boring and confusing.It's boring because it lacks a coherent, compelling story. In a nutshell, this movie is about a bunch of people wandering around rather aimlessly. To disguise the simplicity of that 'story', many names of people, places and things are thrown at you constantly. As a consequence, I was rather annoyed than entertained.It's no use arguing about taste, but I cannot begin to understand why this mess is considered by so many to be one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unprecedented mamoth of splendor, majesty, and magic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece film is borne out of direction with soaring passion! Period. But wait... can't help it... can't fight it... anyone who has beheld this film's beauty is sure-bound to feel the sense of pouring out a stampede of adjectives and superlatives in describing it - almost to the point of annoying exagerration and over-acting! (Such is actually evident with how I word my review, as I have so realized post-writing.)First, is this film better than Fellowship? I'd say it's at par with Fellowship's magic. While some claim the WOW factor is absent in TTT, I beg to disagree. There are still many areas and aspects of the film that abound with it! The landscapes still wow us. The structures (Edoras, Helm's Deep) still do. The attention to details. Frodo's acting. And so on. Then, there's gollum/smeagol.Is gollum real-like? No, conceptually. But technically, YES. The image rendering is perfect. The only thing that betrays its being real-like is that we know for a fact that no such real creature exists, or can exist. Switching this reminder off in our brains and you have the most realistic CGI creation ever made. But you don't have to consciously turn a part of your brain off primarily because the personality the creature bears will make everything feel real.Did TTT deviate much from the book? Yes it did, on many accounts. 1st, it deviated from the Tolkien aura, for me at least. I do not think Tolkien ever intended for example, the battle to be of this magnitude. 2nd, you know the rest... (Faramir's attitude, the elves helping at Helm's deep, the Arwen Eowyn Aragorn love triangle, etc.)Were the deviations good? Yes, they were coherent with the whole plot. They did not do damage.My only negative comment comes in the form of a suggestion: PJ needs to develop more individual combat shoots, in addition to the collective (generalized) non-detailed combat he used most often esp. in Helm's deep. There should be more martial arts, hand-to-hand combat sequences on top of the collective combats. Ever seen how Legolas mounted on his horse? Or how the Elves shoot arrows? More of these detailed individual feats should be made.The plot was never confusing, even for someone who has'nt read the 2nd book. But watching or reading the first movie or book is a must.Finally, the march of the ents to Isengard as well as the Battle of Helm's Deep are spectacular. The Battle of Helm's Deep effectively gave us (in fact let us feel) the sense of the "large-scaleness" of the battle, the valor and determination of each men, as well as hope and despair.Rating: No movie is ever perfect, even this one. With that in mind, I'll give this a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as FOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers I waited a year for this film. Overall, it was a disappointment to me. As a real Tolkien fan, I loved the first film and understood most alterations to the book as more or less necessary for shortening the plot to three and a half hours. I love the long DVD version even more than the shorter cinema version as the extension calms the journey a little bit, so the watcher can really see what is happening.In the second film TTT the sets, tricks and character looks are again excellent. The best persons in my humble opinion are Wormtongue and of course: Gollum really put to live, the most interesting person even in the books; here a real character.What I don't like are the alterations to the book, as they replace plot with massacre! A chapter in the book is made the central part in the film, lasting may be half an hour while eight chapters are left out and shifted partly to the third film, as the last scene clearly implies. That the battle is changed: replacement of the rangers by elves and Erkenbrand by Eomer is not the problem, but for example the Ents: Why do they turn up at Isengard so suddenly after the decision to do nothing at the Ent Thing and the rethinking of Treebeard ad the border of Fangorn? Or why does Frodo face a Nazgul at Osgiliath who should clearly feel the presence of the ring and restart the hunt for it at Osgiliath? A decade of plot outline from Tolkien is replaced by holes!Overall a must see film, but a clear decrease after FOTR. What will we see in the third film? The book alone has enough plot for two Jackson films, but elements of the TTT book have to be added to Return of the king, namely Shelob and the joining of Merry/Pippin with Gandalf/Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli (and Eowyn!!!) for further adventures together.</fullReview>

I cried more the first time but... I'm a little sensitive sometimes, specially at cinemas... (laugh). well, more people are introduced in this film, but they weren't hard to learn, at least I didn't think so. some people asked: which of the films are best? I prefer to see them as one movie, but three chapters... cause they hold together, right? I won't choose one movie, I see them as one history and it will remain like that even when I've seen the last. To see this film, I suggest that you see number one first, cause it will be much easier to understand... this is a great story from the beginning, and probably to the end also.</fullReview>

Before this movie, I happened to listed to LOTR reading cassettes. I really like the voice of Gollum of that version which was a bit low and the "gollum" was more like swallowing the word itself.

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has made another film that reminds us why the love going to the movies. Big battles - amazing characters (Gollum is one cool CGI treat), subplots on top of subplots, etc. I don't care how big your widescreen TV is at home, you need to see these movies at the theatre.With that said, I do have a problem with "The Two Towers". And this is coming from someone who has not read the books. (Cast me into the depths of hell now!)Did Tolkien intend on having his characters turn into likeable, "cute" people we could laugh at and with? These movies are dark, forboding, operatic tales of good vs evil. Should I be laughing and giggling at small sarcastic quirky jokes about Gimli's height? Or the "competition" he and the Elfin Robin Hood have during the battle? It just seemed that Jackson tried a little to hard to make sure that EVERYONE liked this movie - and created some humor mixed in with the poignant story telling. For me, the two didn't mix very well.And while I am glorifying and criticizing this movie at the same time... someone needs to tell me about the Tree creatures from Tolkiens stories. In my opinion, they hurt the film. Where they big huggable characters in the books? All they reminded me of were some those other characters that many movie fans detested, and felt they had no place in a large epic saga - those other characters that also "cutely" assisted the heroes in their fight against the dark forces... anyone know which pint sizes, hairy (Wookie-looking) creatures I am referring to??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very high expectations when I went to see this film, partly because the first film, "The fellowship of the ring" was, according to me, a masterpiece, and partly because I had heard so many good things about this sequel. Three hours later, I stumbled out of the cinema with tears in my eyes. I was totally blown away, what an amazing film! I couldn't speak for several hours, I was so impressed. "The Two Towers" is a much more violent and darker film than the first film, and you can tell from the way that Peter Jackson is directing. The film gives us an image of what a war in a ancient, forgotten country could have been like. The actors are very good, especially Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and John Rhys-Ifans. Elijah wood is better than the last film, and he gives some positive surprises (check out the scene in the ending!) The environment is, as always, perfect and I think the technique is much, much better than in the first film. Gollum/sméagol is is probably the best computer-made character I have ever seen on the big screen, his face and body are so synchronized and he moves and expresses feelings as a normal actor! Standing ovation, Andy Serkis. To sum up, this is a very well-made film. All the films elements comes together and takes us on a wonderful journey - Back to middle earth, before our age. This fire burns with an inner fire that I haven't seen in a long, long while and I think it has to do with Peter Jackson's and the other crews, passion for Tolkiens books and characters. A million thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the book but excellent in every way!!! Film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, this is the best movie I've seen for 2002.The movie completely blew me away. It was an excellent adaptation from the book in my opinion and what really REALLY surprises me is the makers adapted one part that wasn't at all in the original three books (all the parts about Arwen leaving Middle Earth and the facts about inmortality and stuff) but in the apendixes by Tolkien himself (he talked about many things in those apendices, including the love between Arwen and Aragorn, The fates of Elrond, Galadriel and other high elves and some other really cool stuff that just make the Middle Earth world more believable and absolutely incredible). It all fit so well in the movie. I think it was a marvelous work (the book adaptation).But having read the books some dozens of times (again, if you saw the movie and you liked it, you will love the books much MUCH more dearly) I was surprised by how some stuff was cut out of it. Like the book 2 ends after Frodo was taken for dead after the fight with She-lob and it really made the ending MUCH more intriguing. Then I hated the way Gimli was treated in this movie, making dwarves be such stupid characters and they're not at all (he is not stupid in the book at all)...One thing I was also very surprised and never thought the movie would make it possible was the change the king of Rohan, Theoden, went through after meeting Gandalf again.... I never thought they could make it appear by such a difference between the before and the after but they did!!They also picked a really nice actress for the role of Eowyn....Never thought there would be someone to be able to perform such a strong female character without making it look like she was taken from an action movie.Gollum/Smeagol was astounishing and I think he's the central character in this movie. WHat a great work they did with him.finally, just one thing that I really wish I could have seen more of is the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog. In the book Tolkien made my imagination run wild with it....wished the movie would have done something like that too.Well, these are just my opinions...One more year........hope the 3rd part will be longer (it would be amazing to have a Retur of The King 4 hours long!!!!!) and I also hope they won't cut the final part of the book (spoiler: it doesn't end with Frodo destroying the ring) but also show his coming back to the Shire, the Grey Havens and Sam's return home.By they way......this movie would be very hard to see (wouldn't understand a lot of things) if I hadn't seen the extra 30 minutes of the extended edition of the first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson did a very good job on everything, not only when it comes to choosing cast for the movie, but the set, computer generated effects, everything! He had the best team working on it and that is what makes this movies so great! Although Tolkien fans would never forgive him killing Haldir, but, hey you gotta do something to make the movie more interesting.Just imagine him filming that boring part in first book about Shire? Wed never bothered to look the movie till the end!All in all, great movie, both of them! Looking forward to last one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..which of course is almost impossible when you've read the books 7 or 8 times. But Ill try.Adaptation: 6.5Probably going to be my lowest score. If there was one story that jumps straight from the page as a complete visual and dramatic entity then it's got to be this one. Leaving scenes/ characters out is going to have to happen unless the finished film lasts 15 hrs or so, but there doesn't seem to be any need for inventing anything new. Certainly no need for any new action scenes - so I took umbrage at the extra battle between Aragorn, the Riders and some mounted Orcs - and the subsequent 'is Aragorn alive or not' bit. It's all new and just didnt work for me at all. There was no tension there since it is obvious to one and all (even those who havent read the book) that the romantic lead is not going to be written out half-way through. Aragorn lamely turns up again at Helm's deep and that's about it.As a general point to me it is also obvious whenever something non-Tolkein happens in the film. There is a sudden lack of substance/ thud/ conviction. At first I thought this was born from my familiarity with the original story. But to me there is a distinct lack of inspiration in the new scenes and the feeling that they don't belong to the original's overall architecture.I wasn't happy with the scene where Merry and Pippin manage to make it to Fangorn, and the preceeding running down of the orcs by the riders - which is so well described in the book I was looking for something rather more in the film than was delivered. The book had a real sense of a race against the clock, with tension and action - more than enough for a good screenplay!Losing the extra Orc battle and Aragorn yawn bit and adhering more faithfully to the book would have improved things. I conceed that adaptation must be a bit of a b*gger to do well. Rather like flattening the biscuit tin lid - as soon as you flatten one bump, another one pops out somewhere else and you have to change that too.. etc. Simple answer - don't fiddle - and especially don't fiddle purely to add action. We have enough action already.Take the Faramir change/ Frodo to Osgiliath. For one ghastly moment I was reminded of 'Reign of fire' - thankfully it passed, but it was a nasty reminder of what a narrow plank Jackson walks sometimes. The book already had a quite simple distinction between Faramir and Boromir. It was an important distinction that parallels the difference between the corrupt men who had been letting Middle earth slip, and those who would be entrusted with it's bright new future. Jackson has blurred this - and I hope he's got a good reason for doing so.Theoden. Hmmm, quite liked the concept of making him possessed by Sauruman. In the book, his negative and insular attitude is a result of years of subtle guidance from Wormtongue. And I conceed this would have been hard to get across convincingly in a short space of time. But in the book - when he snaps out of it - he snaps out of it for good. In the film, he has some relapses in Helms deep. THis didnt make alot of sense for me...Final remarks about the adaptation are on the two climaxes... Ah yes, and of course you are right, you can;t have two climaxes can you. In the book, space separates the flooding of Isengard from the Battle at Helms deep. THis gives each it's place and prominence within the drama. In the film, JAckson cuts from one to another. (even though one happens mostly at Night, the other during the day.....?!) As a result I believe the impact of both suffers. Which is saying something because even with this weakness they are both fantastic. But it's a bit like trying to flick between two channels - one showing 'Titanic', the other 'Waterloo'. Marriages have foundered on such behaviour!ps Unlike some I wasn;t too worried about who turns up at the last minute at Helms Deep. I sooo liked those Elven warriors that I kind of forgave Jackson that one.Cinematography/ Costumes/ general look: 10Faultless - a yardstick for others to follow. Particularly liked the elven warriors. They had am impressive 'other worldly' quality about them. Gollum - utterly utterly perfect. But Im not going to give Jackson all the credit for this. The reason G has got almost universal approval from LotR officianados the world over is that he is one of the best described chararcters in all fantasy literature - and Jackson has just drawn him straight from the book. Jolly good job too in my mind - since if G had been a failure - then so might the entire trilogy.Ents - pretty good. Again could have really blown but they didnt.Isn't New Zealand a nice place ?! Speaking as someone who has had the good sense to Emigrate here, it has always been easy to relate the geography here to Middle-earth.Riders? - Again about right. Edoras was nicely Scandinavian I thought.Acting: 9The acting behind the CGI Gollum is spectularly good. Not sure how the academy may view the achievement, but it's the standout performance for me.Getting happier with Aragorn - and all the other cast members seem to be about right. Wormtongue especially good - (Only minor quibble is Elrond. Every time he appears I hear 'That. Mr Anderson, is the sound of inevitability....'. I just can;t stop myself....)Ps. Hey - Im sorry but Treebeard and Gimili's voices were obviously one and the same.....Script: 8Nothing too silly. Enough lines taken direct from the book - even Gimili humour was done nicely and didnt pander. I think we've lost alot of the poetry that is contained in the books. But I guess we have the BBC radio series for this if we need it.Overall: 9As a standalone film 'Excellent' - and better than the 'Fellowship'. But put this down to the better structure of the TT book than anything else. And in any case there is no way you can judge this or any of the Trilogy on it's own - especially if you have yet to read the books.In general, there was more additions than were necessary, and some missed opportunities. Jackson was never going to keep everyone happy, but he's probably upset fewer than might have been expected given the passion that surrounds this work.As a final point - Ive never been to a movie that passed so quickly - or where the audience applauded at the end. There are some of the most breath taking scenes ever filmed - and I'm personally very grateful that someone has so lovingly (and by and large faithfully) brought to life one of the great works of English literature.Judgement as a piece of film making - very good.</fullReview>

Tough in some places the action got kinda stuck, the message were given over very well. The scenario didn't went exactly as written in book: In the book, Faramir understood Frodo, and let him go from the hideout and didn't drag him to Osgiliath.For conclusion, a well made second part of the Trilogy...worth of 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give The Two Towers a full 10 stars out of 10 and declare it a must-see. Here's why:The Lord of the Rings has been with me since I first read it in early adolescence (now quite while ago). As such, my relationship with it over the years has been very personal, and as 2000 drew to a close I knew I would be a tough critic of any attempt at turning these very special books into films.So I began watching The Fellowship of the Ring with trepidation. By its close, I esteemed it a tremendous achievement, worthy of much praise. But as anyone familiar with the books knows, the real challenges for a film-maker determined to mount the whole epic really begin with Book 3, the first of The Two Towers...The second film is an unequivocal triumph. It works on every level, through the grandest moments to the most intimate. And it surpasses the first picture in significant ways.Underlying the success of the film is its realisation of the world in which the drama takes place. With dedicated attention to detail, Middle Earth is brought to life as a continent inhabited by real people, their feelings as real as the grime on their faces and the dirt under their fingernails. The landscape is marked out by palpable contrasts of geography and culture, all fitting into a strong spatial context where distances and differences matter. One has the feeling that to walk from Hobbiton to Edoras really is like walking from Paris to Moscow.The Two Towers introduces a new human element which was rather lacking in the first film, through new characters and a fuller treatment of old ones. Here Peter Jackson is admirably served by his cast: Bernard Hill is perfect as Theoden (and this although I had originally imagined the king of the Riddermark as a much older man), and there is an eye-catching turn from David Wenham, whose performance as Faramir is transfixing. Real humanity is introduced through powerful details, too: normality shattered by the onslaught of the orcs; boys and grandfathers in ill-fitting helmets manning the parapets to await battle; women and children cowering in caves, listening to the awful fate of the men who must defend them with their lives.Every scale of engagement, from attritional siege to minor skirmish, is represented in the course of the opening war - and represented as a messy, frantic tangle, a chaotic contact sport with the highest of stakes. The orcs are seen as skilled, strong, courageous, disciplined and determined. In so many films any excitement is utterly undermined by what I term the 'Keystone Baddies' effect: take for example Imperial Storm Troopers who can't hit jack and don't know the meaning of the word 'cover', up against heros who never miss. But in The Two Towers, the orcs are every bit as dangerous as their non-orc opponents. We see them fall in scores to arrows, only to exact retribution with their own crossbows when in range; at close-quarters, as many non-orcs as orcs are seen slain; once-immaculate elven warriors lie cheek-by-jowl in the mud with goblins. These battles are to the death, and no-one holds back for the purposes of narrative.Perhaps the most remarkable achievement is Smeagol, pure CGI except in voice. In those films I had previously seen employing such effects, they were never used as more than tokens to please the eye. But so assured is the characterisation by Andy Serkis and the sfx team that this entirely artificial personage becomes as real as the human cast: indeed, he carries some of the most heart-wrenching scenes (for example the soliloquy in which he wrestles with his twisted, ring-intoxicated self).To cap it all, no concession is made to younger audiences. This phenomenon has bedevilled movies for too long, and it's time a stop was put to it. Example: in the original Star Wars trilogy, there was not a single child, and yet all three films were perfectly accessible to all ages. Twenty years on, and Episode I is all about a child (one who can't act, moreover), and Episode II has content clearly intended to help children get involved (the young Boba Fett, who's also no Olivier). No such compromises in either installment of The Lord of the Rings (and compromises they would be, for there is nothing of the sort in the books). These are films for adults, just as they should be. If kids have to grow into them, they'll be the better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I See the Tolkien purists, I see the fools, I see the fans, but what I don't see is anyone bitching about common stupidity during the battle.It strikes one as odd that no one thought to start PUSHING the damned ladders over when they started coming up, after all, you've got to keep them from coming up so that's one way to do, appoint some of the Elves to be ready to slice up the Uruk-Hai on top then push his ladder to the side, sending it crashing.Also, as for those who bitch that the Uruk-Hai were so easy to hold off, these guys were just spawned, I don't think they've had time to master the art of swordsmanship in a few days, or does that never register for you? If someone just shoved a sword into your hand, how well would you perform?As for when the Wall broke down and the Uruk-Hai charged through and set up that spear line, I really shook my head, you charged a bunch of pointy spears, when you really should have filled the buggers up with arrows, then attacked, I swear, what is that?As for Aragorn and Gimli holding off the Uruk-Hai chargers on the bridge, they do sort of have an advantage, they only have to attack forwards, they KNOW how to handle their weapons and when you start killing a fair number of them, the bodies tend to pile and make it difficult for their fellows to get over the corpses.As for the 300 Vs 10,000, it was more like 600-700 with the Elves arriving, add the fact that you only have to fight a fraction of their force at a time, the ones with crossbows, the ones climbing up the ladders and making it through the breach, you fight the enemies who are actually attacking, not waiting their turn.As for you Tolkien Purists, I don't care how dedicated you are, I doubt New Line Cinema was going to spring for three NINE-Hour movies and I doubt the actors wanted to spend a decade in New Zealand only to find out a few thousand geeks in Elf, Dwarf and Wizard costumes show up. This is an abridged version as Movies usually are and if you don't like that, well the book's still there buddy, READ IT AGAIN FOR ALL I CARE. I don't watch JP: Lost World and keep it in my DVD Collection, I read the book because the movie is a travesty and is nothing like the book.The movie itself is great, the animatics are amazing, the Ents are a beautiful creation to behold and Gollum was great work too, the Special Effects are hitting new levels these days and it shows. The acting was great and I find the performances are enhanced in this film as the Fellowship falls into their roles and performs them splendidly, Gimli was comic relief but it was helpful in a movie with little humour too it, Gollum was an annoyance at times but he also was used very well.Still, I must ask you, if you hate the movie that much, why do you waste your time bitching about it? You are just giving up more of your time to something you hate in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Pathos is more, less Arwen is more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TTT picks up where FotR ends, naturally. The opening sequence of TTT is breathtaking, why a girl in the row behind me even cheered when Gandalf snatches Glamdring in mid air. You're in medias res and can't help but to immerse yourself in the world of Middle-Earth once again. The grin was back on my face, I liked it... yes you know what I am going to say... the 3 letter word: "but" - but not all is well in the land of Tolkien this time around.The book has 3 main plot lines and so does the movie. A difficult and daunting task one the director has mastered well to a certain degree. I will not argue about character changes plot cuts, rearrangements or additions, since it is the right of the director to do what he or she feels is necessary in the light of dramaturgy.Again: but... the pacing does not feel right this time, esp. flashback scenes with Arwen slow the movie down to zero numerous times and are trying the viewers patience and good will, esp. since Liv Tyler fails to impress us with her interpretation of Arwen.But... it is not only Liv Tyler's scenes, the "pathos" swings high throughout the movie, too high for my taste. King Theoden could have been depicted with greater care and detail and less "pathetic". Him crying with close-up is a little too much. Let him say his lines at his son's grave and "cut" for pity sake.All in all it is still a well made movie and a worthy successor of FotR. Unfortunately, if you haven't seen the first part you won't get much out of the second one. If you have read the books then you will be upset about certain changes and additions or omissions (as you might have been with FotR). Try to ignore your first impulse and see it for what it is: An interpretation of Tolkien's masterpiece, an action loaded one with a lot of pathos and less character development, except for Gollum, who really saved the day this time around.Kudos to Andy Serkins. Never have I been so thrilled to watch a CGI character on screen and forget that it is CGI I am watching. Bravo. Of course all effects are top-notch (yes, the Ents are fantastic, too) and the musical score is darker and matches the movie's tone very well.Given the difficulty to film the 3 plotted 2nd part one might forgive the "pathos" and flashback sequences, even the Faramir changes or the (pointless) "Aragorn River scene" (etc.) but since the pacing is already extremely difficult to handle with 3 plots, it weighs even heavier to make such drastic pacing "mistakes" or - let's say - rather "decisions". 3 points off for this one, Mr. PJ.7/10 Theatrical Release [maybe 9/10 for Extended Edition if we see more Faramir character development, if certain flashback scenes are cut/changed and if we get more screen time for Ents]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two towers weaves 4 separate tales, all of which come together at the end of the book. The difficulty of bringing this to the screen, and in only 3 hours time, had to be daunting, but Jackson managed it splendidly! The creation of Edoras and Hornburg were amazing, and the action carried me along so completely that the 3 hours seemed like a much shorter time. I admit that I was put off a bit by some of the changes made to the story. I can understand giving some of the key characters more exposure, but I don't understand such decisions as changing the outcome of the Ent Moot or Frodo's encounter with Faramir, who was a wiser and more noble character in the book. Still, it was a fantastic film. I have seen it twice and may see it again before it leaves town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film of 2002!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this better than Fellowship? Well, I'm undecided. This has improvements and in turn it has elements that are lost from the first one. I'm not talking in terms of quality, in production, acting, directing etc, but this is the middle of the story. While this introduces new characters and had the complication and more large scale battles, I really liked the exposition of the first film, with its sense of mystery building up, I was also a big fan of Borimir, he was a great character and his brother, who appears in this film is not quite as interesting.Some of the improvements are as followed. Aragons role in the film is more central. In this film he is in it start to finish whereas he didn't enter the first movie until an hour in. I think Viggo's expanded role will give him a very good shot for an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor. He didn't quite have enough screen time in Fellowship to warrant that but he certainly put an Oscar worthy performance in. The rest of the cast are on fine form and I think I really have to re-iterate everything I said about the first film. This is pure magic and film making excellence, the production design is fantastic, the whole look of the film from its sets to the visual effects really transport you to middle earth for three hours and keep you transfixed. The real, real star of this movie and really what really breaks the mould in terms of movie magic, which wasn't yet broken by the first installment, is the most frighteningly realistic CGI character ever. Gollum is freakily realistic, and the vocal performance from Andy Serkis is Oscar worthy. You really feel as if he is a real living person, the animation is superb, awe-inspiring.As I mentioned all the cast are great, the new additions such as Bernard Hill and in particular Brad Dourif as Worm Tongue are excellent. Basically, like Fellowship, you won't find a better mixture of top draw action, music, acting, cinematography, direction, production design, visual effects in any movie period. No other films can compete in terms of having grade A class in every department. This gets a well deserved 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Short and to the point: too many tweaks, deletions and additions from the source material. The pacing seemed a little jerky at times. Mr. Jackson spends too much time lingering on details that weren't nearly as important in the book, and I can't see how they made it into the movie (basically everything concerning Arwen (Liv Tyler)). Otherwise a decent film and worth seeing (definitely as a rental). I considered FotR to be much superior as an adaptation and as a movie.Normally I would probably give this a 6/10, but since it's Tolkien I gave it a 7/10 out of respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adored FOTR, even with my impossibly high standards due to my reading the entire series twice. Jackson not only was faithful to the plot but also created a movie that was enjoyable on its own. Then, the sequel came to theaters. After hearing many rumors of how the plot was going to be altered, I admit, I was apprehensive as I sat down in front of that large screen. My fears were soon justified. Yes, the visuals were stunning. Yes, the CGI was beyond anything I could have imagined. Still, the character development was noticeably lacking. Legolas got a little more screen time than in the first movie, but nothing significant, and poor Gimli was reduced to comic relief. Then, Jackson made really unnecessary additions to the plot. Between Aragorn's repeated fantasies about Arwen, and the incident where he almost perished after falling from a cliff, not to mention the kidnapping of Sam and Frodo by Faramir, who was supposed to be wiser than his late brother, I was wondering if the book had been so boring that they had to create an entirely new plot. There were also numerous plot holes. Why were Merry and Pippin brought before the newly-revived Gandalf, and then in the next scene it was like it never happened? Even with elvish abilities, why did it take such a short time for the Lothlorien elves to arrive at Helm's Deep? For that matter, why were they there in the first place? I realize that artistic license must be taken to bring any book to the big screen, but the unnecessary changes only served to hurt the movie as a movie, book aside. I'm hoping that the final film of the trilogy will return to the original plot and give the characters the depth they deserve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a die-hard fan of Tolkien and deviations from the original idea, when well staged and performed, are surely welcomed and appreciated, but I must confess that this time I had great expectations and was disappointed. The film has lots of action and special effects and is very grandiose. It also has a fine storyline, flowing smoothly on, and is technically impeccable. But in spite of all those merits, it has no soul and leaves me cold. In contrast with the first installment, in which there was character and atmosphere building, and you left the theater with a feeling of euphoria, you make no emotional connection with any of the characters in The Two Towers, exception made for the endearing Gimli (Rhys-Jones), creepy Grima (Dourif's very good performance) and the animation character Gollum, which I must say, is the best thing on the film. Others noticeable are McKellen, who manages to come alive as Gandalf with a wink, and Lee's screen presence which is always outstanding. For the rest, I came out of the cinema with a feeling of having been cheated. I just hope that the third installment is as good as the first was.</fullReview>

Come on, people! Read a book for once in your life! This movie, just like the first one, is a masterpiece! As a person who as read the trilogy several times over, I can honestly say that Tolkien would be proud. Peter Jackson has brilliantly carried over Tolkien's amazing vision to the big screen (Yes, you young idiots, the story was a book before it was a movie). Sure there are pieces of the story missing! But would you really want to sit through a nine hour movie!? The meat of the story is there...and it's there in all it's glory. Please...see the movie, but only if you can spell HOBBIT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank you, Peter Jackson. Thank you for bringing things to the screen that I was not able to imagine from the book in my mind's eye for some reason.Respects paid, I'd like to comment on the film. It was fantastic. I grew up on the books (as many reviewers have, naturally), and I have loved every minute of both Fellowhip and Two Towers. I am not a Tolkein snob, though, and I don't care that they cut certain things short or out entirely. I understand that this is a movie, and it's Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, and I'm okay with other people's interpretations of things.I was particularly excited about seeing Gollum, the Ents, the kingdom of Rohan, and Shelob when I first sat in the theatre. Shelob did not appear, but that's okay, they left off at a really good point, leaving the viewers who haven't read the books saying, "Wait, who the hell is this 'she' that Gollum's speaking about????"I was really impressed with Gollum. When he smiled when Frodo first called him Smeagol, I was creeped out. And then I remembered it was CGI stuff that created him and I got even more goosebumps.I would have liked to have seen more with the Ents (not only 'cause they're cool, but Dominic Monaghan is wildly attractive). I would have also liked to see them be bigger, but this isn't my interpretation of things.Rohan.... When I read the books as a young'n, I LOVED Rohan. I couldn't (and still can't) help but feel that if I lived in that fictitious world, I would have lived in that kingdom. Hell, I'd give anything to play Eomer. Anyway, at first I was a little disappointed with it. I pictured the kingdom being more majestic and regal, like the horses they master. I pictured marble halls, a lot of blue, and cleaner surroundings, but after I saw the movie for a second time, I got used to it. I am growing to love it, actually. The Norweigan fiddle they used as a theme of sorts for Rohan was just incredible.Dear me, this is getting long. Okay, in short (too late), this is an incredible cast. Fantastic performances from Dominic Monaghan (not just because he's attractive), Ian McKellan (duh), David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, Craig Parker, Elijah Wood, blah blah blah.Again, thank you Peter Jackson. I don't really know how I'm going to last until next December, but I'll be crapping my pants in anticipation the whole year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God, I have waited a whole rather painful year for this. Not that that was a bad thing - it just gave me another excuse to watch the first film over and over. And thank you God, praise you Peter Jackson, you failed to disappoint me. Again. From the opening scene with Gandalf and the Balrog where I sat with my mouth open for a good five minutes, to the second most painful cliff hanger of all time (the first being FOTR), I was in movie heaven, thanks to a little something known as Peter Jackson, Tolkien and Orlando Bloom. After spending at least three hours downloading the trailer on my (slow as hell) computer, I have been waiting and waiting for the second installment of the brilliant Lord of the Rings trilogy. And then the time finally came, and once again I was swept to Middle Earth. The film was everything I expected and much, much more. Not only was every new member of the cast as brilliant as I had expected, the special effects even more spectacular, the music even more beautiful, but this film actually broke the sound barrier and topped 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. We weren't just given some new characters who waltzed in and had one thing to say and then we never saw them again, these characters played a big part in the story. Gollum was probably my favourite - the tortured little soul yearning for the ring provided some wonderful little moments and also tickled my funny bone at times. He was also very freaky in some ways too - as my brother said after we first saw it "He looked so damn real!" I also found it more funnier than the first film too - Gimli mostly providing the comic relief. And as for the battle of Hemls Deep - oh my God, how can ANYONE top that? Well, I have no doubt that P J can in 'Return of the King'. I thought that after seeing the first film, nothing could top all the surprises and effects in this one. I was wrong. Of course, the Gandalf and Balrong opening sequence was probably one of my favourites, but also the completely unexpected unveiling of the Ringwraith on the dragon! HOW cool??? I think my second most favourite thing about this movie other than the movie itself was the music. Once again Howard Shore delivers a superbly written and beautifully scored soundtrack. I have a thing for choir singing and dramatic sounding music - tracks "Evenstar", "Isengard Unleashed", and "Foundations of Stone" so you get my drift... Anyway, before I get disconnected off the internet, I will round it up. If you LOVED, or even liked FOTR, then get your arse down to the cinema and see this film. The only disappointment is that it doesn't last six hours like it really should...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Growth of a Masterpiece Continues, *Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers, professional as well as us amateurs, have commented that *The Two Towers* departs much more from the novel than did *The Fellowship of the Ring*. I have gone over both movies comparing them with the novel and don't find this to be the case. One difference between the movie and the book is organizational. In the book, all of the events involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, etc were told as a continuous story followed by the events involving Frodo, Sam and Gollum even though these events were taking part concurrently. The movie instead interwove these. This gives the appearance of being more of a departure than it was and actually I find the movie approach in this respect more satisfying. Presumably, this approach will continue into *The Return of the King*. Another seeming departure is that the last 4 chapters of each of these halves of the story were excluded. That much of this will be presented in *The Return of the King* is fairly certain. Gollum, e.g. does say that She will be able to help him recover the ring, referring of course to Shelob. I assume that the chapters after the defeat of Sauron will greatly reduced. Except for the very important *Scouring of the Shire* most of these are rather anticlimactic. Faramir's behavior is different than in the book. In the book he never attempted to take Frodo and the Ring back to Gondor. However in the movie he does, in the end, realize the *truth* and lets Frodo continue his mission. I find this probably more believable behavior than the more noble image depicted in the book. To some extent the same can be said for the Ents. In the book, Treebeard was well aware of Saruman's crimes against the forest and I find it unlikely that he had to wait until the coming of a couple of Hobbits before he felt motivated to take action. On the other hand, I find it also unlikely that, as in the movie, he would have been unaware of Saruman's crimes. Either way, this part still leaves me a bit dissatisfied. I did find the addition of Aragorn's plight, after falling over the cliff and being presumed lost, a bit contrived. I assume that's so they could add more of the Aragorn/Arwen romance to the story but maybe they could have found a better way. And talking of Arwen, the movie gives the impression that she has, after all, taken the ship over the sea. That could of course lead the way open for Aragorn, instead of Faramir, to marry Eowyn. That would be a significant departure. My bet is that Arwen will prove not to have sailed after all. Further speaking of Elves, I was glad to see Elves, lead by Haldir, come to the aid of Rohan at Helm's Deep. The Elves after all ultimately had a large part in bringing all these troubles about to begin with even if that's not apparent in LOTR.The highlight of this movie for me is Gollum. I've always regarded him as the most interesting character in LOTR anyway and was hoping they would do his part well. Not only was it done technically superbly well but they capture much of the combined revulsion and pathos of Gollum. I'm in the ranks of those who would like to see an Oscar for Andy Serkin.Finally there is the battle of Helm's Deep. This was done as spectacularly as I anticipated (based to a large extent on the short battle scene presented as a prologue to *The Fellowship of the Ring*. Many have hailed this as the most spectacular battle scene you will ever see in a movie. Maybe to date, but this is but a skirmish compared to the Siege of Gondar/Battle of Pellanor Fields in *The Return of the King* ! Prepare to be blown away by that one.</fullReview>

Great value for money with three hours of dark entertainment. I thought Pipin had a rubbish part in this movie but never mind. The Tree Shepards are very cute and the SFX are great.

		<shortDescription>could not have been a better sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When has adaptation been the only requirement in determining the quality of a film? Last time I have checked, directing, script, and acting were the primary requirements. This commentary is less a review and more a rant as to why a weak adaptation does not make for a weak movie. First and foremost, regardless of how good this movie was people can't help be a little dissapointed. Before everyone was deflowered by the fellowship there was a sense of excitement and awe as to what was to be expected. The fellowship delivered in every respect. Everything was new and exciting, thus with recycled footage, the eye candy does not have the same impact. But this is just a minor problem. Another key issue lies in the ending of the fellowship. People were left wanting more, and could only rely on their sense of imagination as to what would occur the next installment. What this meant was expectations that could never be met, after all, we have been given a most excellent tour of middle earth in the fellowship and now its time to deal with plot. Finally because it was the first installment we were much more forgiving as to how the book was modified, in fact for every change made in two towers I could name two changes in the fellowship.My first viewing resulted in analysing the s*** out of the two towers and thus I could not enjoy it. The so called mortal sins commited would have to be the weaknesses found in King Theodens and Faramirs character. Theoden was a much more confident king in the book and much more likeable and Faramir was much stronger willed than his brother, Boromir, and does not succumb to the power of the ring nor take the ring to Osgiliath. The next is the chapters ommited i.e. Aragorn and crew heading to Isengard and Shelob the spider bitch. The venial sins commited are due to typical blockbuster formula. Gimli's comic relief, the love conflict between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn, the elfs assisting at helms deep and Eomer/Gandalf to the rescue at the end. These follow the typical Hollywood formula and there is no sense in fighting them they always were and always will be present.When adapting a novel it cannot be done word for word for there are qualities that make a book good which would make a movie bad and vice-versa. After a most excellent war seen the movie had to be ended any furthur action sequence would have seemed less significant and second rate not to mention the viewers need for a break.People's concern with the so called craming that will have to be done in the third installment need no worry for it is the shortest book and really not a whole lot happens. I mean for how long could you watch Sam and Frodo hide from orcs before climbing Mount Doom? This will most likely be shortened to spend more time in developing Aragorns character. And if one can remember how much time was spent in Hobbiton at the begining of the fellowship, this was merely to suck the purests in if you think they will change the end of the book you are mistaken they will have have to end the movie just as detailed.As far as the two towers is concerned it was a damn good movie. With the exception of the Hollywood cheese,(Legolas surfing on the shield was utter shite) acting was tight, directing near flawless(given the amount of jumping from story line to story line it could not have been any smoother, and the script was better than the fellowship. If anyone cannot forgive Peter Jackson for modifying the book should go watch Harry Potter and stop p***ing me off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not true to the books, but an excellent alternate vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will cheerfully admit that I am a Tolkien fan, and was concerned about the changes that I had heard/read about on the web sites etc.However, I decided to go and see it - keeping an open mind - and try to keep my rabid fandom under control (!)Yes, the film is excellent. Yes, there are flaws, but not enough to change the experience significantly. Yes, the story is substantially changed from the book. So what?I have read the book at least once a year since I was nine, which adds up to a "tidy few". I would just like to make one or two points - 1. Literature and film are two completely different media, with completely different strengths and weaknesses, problems and constraints, and those expecting to see exactly what was in the book - everything that was in the book - were always going to be disappointed.2. In the book, Tolkien "travels" with each group in turn, skewing the timelines substantially until everything is tied up at the Black Gate. In film, it would be confusing to do that, as you would have subtantial chunks of the film based around each set of characters in turn, so many cuts and a "contemporaneous action" system makes sense, as Peter Jackson has so ably done.3. The book finishes on a particularly grim note, and is not a suitable cinematic closing point.The review bit - I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I thought the acting was superb, the technical aspects unmatched in any other film I have seen, and the production felt so much that this was a living, breathing world that we were somehow able to get a sneaky glimpse into. I thought that Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortenson developed their characters superbly, with my only major niggles being the 'comic relief' role that has been given to Gimli - he is never very prominent in the book, but the "jokes" began to grate almost immediately. I was also very irritated by the fact that &lt;spoiler&gt; Gandalf's return &lt;end of Spoiler&gt; was shown in the trailers - that completely ruined the tension and wonder of the moment.My rating? 8.5 - maybe 9 if it does what the Fellowship did and improve on second watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah, so he changed some parts . . . but with reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never actually written a review for IMDB before but I felt the need in this case for three reasons: 1) I loved the books; 2) I've loved both movies so far; and 3) Because I just read a review by someone saying you could not do both.This person mainly took issue with the changing of certain parts and the absence of others. I'm briefly going to address a few of the differences between the book THE TWO TOWERS and Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of it and why I feel the differences were, in the vast majority of cases, more than justified. I may touch on one or two SPOILERS in the process so readers beware.The first point I would like to address is that of the length of the three books. This reviewer claimed it was ridiculous for Peter Jackson (hereafter PJ) to have left some of the latter portions of the Two Towers (hereafter TT) story for inclusion in The Return of the King (hereafter ROTK) because ROTK was already the longest volume. This, in fact, is an inaccurate statement. While ROTK does contain the most pages, a large portion of those pages are dedicated to the Appendices. In reality, ROTK contains the LEAST number of pages actually dedicated to the story - that being 374. The Fellowship of the Ring (hereafter FOTR) contains 509 pages dedicated to the main story, making it the longest. TT rings in at 435 story pages. Right from the start then we can see that ROTK can reasonably borrow some story from TT to make it match the length and style of the first two movies.To further support the extraction of some story from TT for placement in ROTK is the fact that TT is actually the most in-depth and involved of the three books (though some may disagree with me I suppose). I say that for a few simple reasons. FOTR is the beginning of a number of stories which prepare to diverge and ROTK is the conclusion of a number of stories which once again converge. TT, on the other hand, is the book in which these divergent stories must be dealt with and developed.As most people are aware, it is almost always impossible to make a movie exactly mirror a book. There is much that reads well but does not film well. An example mentioned by John-Rhys Davies (Gimli the Dwarf) is that in the book of FOTR, Gimli asks Galadriel for a strand of hair from her head as a gift and she gives him three. That may read well, but imagine trying to film that. Zoom in as she plucks three hairs from her head and then hands them to Gimli? Doesn't make for a very nice scene, nor would it even be possible to SEE the hairs. In the extended version of the FOTR film they deal with it differently and leave it out of the theatrical version altogether.In the book of TT, Frodo complains about the weight of the ring countless times and keeps stumbling because of it. Had they shown it in the movie any more than they did it would have just become annoying.Here's a bit of a spoiler. In the book of TT, King Theoden's nephew, Eomer, and all of the Rohirrim, accompany the King and his people to Helm's Deep, along with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Eomer fights alongside them at the battle of Helm's Deep and then at dawn Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill with Erkenbrand of Westfold and all his men and turns the tide of the battle. In the movie, Eomer and the Rohirrim are banished from Rohan by Grima Wormtongue and ride away North. At dawn, after the battle of Helm's Deep has carried on all night, Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill to save the day with Eomer and the Rohirrim. This may seem like a useless change from the book but it is not. In the book of TT, after showing up to help with the battle of Helm's Deep, Erkenbrand is a fairly minor character with not much time devoted to him, if any at all (he may play a part in the battle during ROTK but I can't quite remember). This change was simply a way of keeping the main storyline and events very similar to the book without having to take the time to introduce a brand new but minor character. Consider, this movie already had the task of introducing Gollum/Smeagol, Theoden, Eomer, Eowyn, Grima Wormtongue, Faramir, Treebeard and the Ents and explaining the Return of Gandalf. That's at least eight major characters . .. seven of them completely new. There simply would not be enough time or enough value in introducing such a character as Erkenbrand, hence PJ slightly adjusted the flow of events to put more light on one of the major characters.As far as Aragorn and the so-called love stories . . . the only love story that is MEANT to be a love story is that of Arwen and Aragorn. Even this storyline - taken from the appendices - is meant to give us further insight to Aragorn and his past and his turmoil. The Aragorn/Arwen plot is not meant to provide a light quality to the movie or simply to attract people who may not be otherwise interested. It serves a purpose. It shows that even love, which in these types of stories (and hopefully in real life) can have the strongest ability to motivate us and keep us hoping has been darkened and soiled with doubt by the shadow of Mordor. The relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn is not a romance at all. Eowyn says early on that she fears a cage and having no chance or hope for valor. She sees the possibility of attaining these things at Aragorn's side. This is evidenced by the relationship she ends up in during ROTK. Neither of these storylines should leave us feeling warm and fuzzy, they should have an uncomfortable feeling to them.This reviewer also claimed both FOTR and TT were badly directed and edited. I don't think I even need to respond to that comment. The actors did magnificent jobs and whose vision do you think they were carrying out. the LOTR movies have been two of the most stunning films I can remember without crossing the border to being just an excuse for CG effects.I think that these movies are a credit to the books and could not have been done better. I praise PJ for his work and look forward to the ROTK movie with anticipation. Clearly it is possible for someone to love both the books and the movies . . . lest we forget that almost everybody who worked on the films were fans of Tolkien and had read the books numerous times.Go see the movie and enjoy it!Hope this wasn't too long :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw the second film in the trilogy the day it came out here in Australia (26 December 02) and I just have to say the air in the cinema was electric, we all cheered as the lights went down and cheered again when the New Line Cinema logo appeard. Peter Jackson's take on the trilogy has only gotten better with The Two Towers. Considering how brilliant The Fellowship of the Ring was this had a lot of expectations to live up to and by far it met every one of them. The battle of Helms Deep, what more can I say then mind-blowing, Gollum and Treebeard were fantastic and the addition of cast members Bernard Hill, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif and David Wenham fantastic. Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor and made you pity Gollum at times and then at the same time feel repulsed by him. By far the hobbits are still my favourite characters, I loved Merry's speech to the ents about being part of Middle Earth, it is by far one of my favourite lines in the film. Sam was gorgeous and of course Elijah Wood brilliant as Frodo, not forgetting Pippin, who was great too. However I do believe that Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Karl Urban (Eomer) didn't get enough screen time, but hopefully Return of the King will change that. All in all a brilliant film, I didn't even realises the three hours it went for. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tolkien fan gives credit despite disappointments with changes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I am a fan of the author, J.R.R. Tolkien. I am not a fanatic who memorizes Elven languages or hobbit genealogies, I am a fan of Tolkien and his brilliant works including `The Lord of the Rings'. I feel that in coming decades and centuries it is quite likely Tolkien will be considered a giant of English Literature rivaled only by Dickens and Shakespeare. At the least Tolkien will be remembered as one of the most important literary figures of the 20th century. Although I don't feel any of the artists who worked on this production come anywhere near Tolkien in creative genius (Peter Jackson included), I do give credit to the movies for turning on a whole generation to Tolkien's written works. Additionally, I don't care what the reason is (whether someone has a crush on Elijah Wood or Orlando Bloom, enjoyed the movie making from a technology standpoint or any other reason) I am grateful to the movie for creating great new enthusiasm for the author's works. Whether Tolkien would have accepted Peter Jackson's interpretation or not is beyond my knowledge and beyond my realm of speculation. I can only comment about what I felt. Here it is:First, I must say that I found many of the changes in the movie annoying and sometimes unnecessary. Yet I only found a few of these changes very disturbing. One of the reasons for this is that most of these changes weren't done in way that was too distracting. For instance, I thought that it was very annoying and completely unnecessary that Elrond sent Elves to fight at Helm's Deep. The elves filed in very quickly and so it did not become too distracting.However, the part where Elrond and Arwen discuss her relationship with Aragorn and the Elves possible role in the wars of men disturbing and poorly written. This was the case with much of the dialogue in the movie in which direct quotes were not pulled from the work. Also, some of the dialogue between Merry and Treebeard was ridiculous especially when he and Pippin trick Treebeard into going towards Isengard. The old Ent said something to the effect of `It's nice to go south now and then' or something very much like that. Any true fan of Tolkien had to cringe at this.Every bit as uncomfortable was Frodo's pep talk with Gollum/Smeagol. While this was somewhat necessary in fairness to the author's intent it is poorly written for the movie. Frodo: `You were not unlike a hobbit at one time'. Blagh! Then at the end of the movie, Gandalf's character leads us into the next movie. To paraphrase: `Now begins the battle of Middle Earth'. This was simply awful.I was also annoyed with the attack by the Orcs on Wargs on the way to Helm's Deep which led to Aragorn's temporary fall. It was not need and his return was unbelievably predictable to anyone who read the books. Imagine doing `The Return of the King' without the king! Still this was only mildly annoying and I did not find it too distracting. Yet wouldn't it have been better to have used that time later in the movie and had Gandalf expel Saruman from the order?! One other note: Gimli's character becoming a focus for humor really didn't bother me much, but the line in which Gimli tells Legolas that he picked the wrong place to stand when the battle at Helm's Deep was about to begin was perhaps the most INANE line in the whole movie.Although I didn't like all the changes in the plot and I thought some of the screenplay was below standard, the acting and the casting were both superb. Ian McKellan was terrific as Gandalf, as was Brad Dourif as Wormtongue, David Wenham as Faramir and Bernard Hill as Theoden. I give Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortenson good ratings. The only cast members I really didn't like were Dominic Monaghan and Sean Astin. I do realize, however, how difficult it must have been to cast the hobbits. I thought Liv Tyler was good as Arwen, I just thought the character was overdone.Miranda Otto was perfect (and perfectly cast) as Eowyn. She was fabulous in portraying both inner and outer beauty. I'm quite sure I would not have been at all happy if this part was not well cast or acted. I just hope that in the final installment, Eowyn's character gets the glory intended for it. If not, I think it will completely ruin most of the good feelings I have for these movies.It was smart to go back and forth to Frodo and Sam's struggles. It would have been terribly boring on film to watch their quest for the Black Gate let by Gollum if had been done in one long stretch. I also like the pace of the movie. NOTHING DRAGGED.Having said all of this as someone with a huge amount of respect for the creator of Middle Earth and all its characters, I also must point out that I feel overall this was an extremely entertaining movie, not despite Peter Jackson and his crew, but because of it. As well as the overall acting, the settings, the costumes, and the action in the movie were all done in a first class manner and I found the movie exciting. As I mentioned in great detail my dissatisfactions with the movie, I realize that putting this work into movie form was a monumental task and I give Mr. Jackson a great deal of credit for putting together a first class project depicting J.R.R. Tolkien's works and adding millions of moviegoers to the ever growing collection of Tolkien's readers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah, so he changed some parts . . . but with reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never actually written a review for IMDB before but I felt the need in this case for three reasons: 1) I loved the books; 2) I've loved both movies so far; and 3) Because I just read a review by someone saying you could not do both.This person mainly took issue with the changing of certain parts and the absence of others. I'm briefly going to address a few of the differences between the book THE TWO TOWERS and Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of it and why I feel the differences were, in the vast majority of cases, more than justified. I may touch on one or two SPOILERS in the process so readers beware.The first point I would like to address is that of the length of the three books. This reviewer claimed it was ridiculous for Peter Jackson (hereafter PJ) to have left some of the latter portions of the Two Towers (hereafter TT) story for inclusion in The Return of the King (hereafter ROTK) because ROTK was already the longest volume. This, in fact, is an inaccurate statement. While ROTK does contain the most pages, a large portion of those pages are dedicated to the Appendices. In reality, ROTK contains the LEAST number of pages actually dedicated to the story - that being 374. The Fellowship of the Ring (hereafter FOTR) contains 509 pages dedicated to the main story, making it the longest. TT rings in at 435 story pages. Right from the start then we can see that ROTK can reasonably borrow some story from TT to make it match the length and style of the first two movies.To further support the extraction of some story from TT for placement in ROTK is the fact that TT is actually the most in-depth and involved of the three books (though some may disagree with me I suppose). I say that for a few simple reasons. FOTR is the beginning of a number of stories which prepare to diverge and ROTK is the conclusion of a number of stories which once again converge. TT, on the other hand, is the book in which these divergent stories must be dealt with and developed.As most people are aware, it is almost always impossible to make a movie exactly mirror a book. There is much that reads well but does not film well. An example mentioned by John-Rhys Davies (Gimli the Dwarf) is that in the book of FOTR, Gimli asks Galadriel for a strand of hair from her head as a gift and she gives him three. That may read well, but imagine trying to film that. Zoom in as she plucks three hairs from her head and then hands them to Gimli? Doesn't make for a very nice scene, nor would it even be possible to SEE the hairs. In the extended version of the FOTR film they deal with it differently and leave it out of the theatrical version altogether.In the book of TT, Frodo complains about the weight of the ring countless times and keeps stumbling because of it. Had they shown it in the movie any more than they did it would have just become annoying.Here's a bit of a spoiler. In the book of TT, King Theoden's nephew, Eomer, and all of the Rohirrim, accompany the King and his people to Helm's Deep, along with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Eomer fights alongside them at the battle of Helm's Deep and then at dawn Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill with Erkenbrand of Westfold and all his men and turns the tide of the battle. In the movie, Eomer and the Rohirrim are banished from Rohan by Grima Wormtongue and ride away North. At dawn, after the battle of Helm's Deep has carried on all night, Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill to save the day with Eomer and the Rohirrim. This may seem like a useless change from the book but it is not. In the book of TT, after showing up to help with the battle of Helm's Deep, Erkenbrand is a fairly minor character with not much time devoted to him, if any at all (he may play a part in the battle during ROTK but I can't quite remember). This change was simply a way of keeping the main storyline and events very similar to the book without having to take the time to introduce a brand new but minor character. Consider, this movie already had the task of introducing Gollum/Smeagol, Theoden, Eomer, Eowyn, Grima Wormtongue, Faramir, Treebeard and the Ents and explaining the Return of Gandalf. That's at least eight major characters . .. seven of them completely new. There simply would not be enough time or enough value in introducing such a character as Erkenbrand, hence PJ slightly adjusted the flow of events to put more light on one of the major characters.As far as Aragorn and the so-called love stories . . . the only love story that is MEANT to be a love story is that of Arwen and Aragorn. Even this storyline - taken from the appendices - is meant to give us further insight to Aragorn and his past and his turmoil. The Aragorn/Arwen plot is not meant to provide a light quality to the movie or simply to attract people who may not be otherwise interested. It serves a purpose. It shows that even love, which in these types of stories (and hopefully in real life) can have the strongest ability to motivate us and keep us hoping has been darkened and soiled with doubt by the shadow of Mordor. The relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn is not a romance at all. Eowyn says early on that she fears a cage and having no chance or hope for valor. She sees the possibility of attaining these things at Aragorn's side. This is evidenced by the relationship she ends up in during ROTK. Neither of these storylines should leave us feeling warm and fuzzy, they should have an uncomfortable feeling to them.This reviewer also claimed both FOTR and TT were badly directed and edited. I don't think I even need to respond to that comment. The actors did magnificent jobs and whose vision do you think they were carrying out. the LOTR movies have been two of the most stunning films I can remember without crossing the border to being just an excuse for CG effects.I think that these movies are a credit to the books and could not have been done better. I praise PJ for his work and look forward to the ROTK movie with anticipation. Clearly it is possible for someone to love both the books and the movies . . . lest we forget that almost everybody who worked on the films were fans of Tolkien and had read the books numerous times.Go see the movie and enjoy it!Hope this wasn't too long :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw the second film in the trilogy the day it came out here in Australia (26 December 02) and I just have to say the air in the cinema was electric, we all cheered as the lights went down and cheered again when the New Line Cinema logo appeard. Peter Jackson's take on the trilogy has only gotten better with The Two Towers. Considering how brilliant The Fellowship of the Ring was this had a lot of expectations to live up to and by far it met every one of them. The battle of Helms Deep, what more can I say then mind-blowing, Gollum and Treebeard were fantastic and the addition of cast members Bernard Hill, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif and David Wenham fantastic. Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor and made you pity Gollum at times and then at the same time feel repulsed by him. By far the hobbits are still my favourite characters, I loved Merry's speech to the ents about being part of Middle Earth, it is by far one of my favourite lines in the film. Sam was gorgeous and of course Elijah Wood brilliant as Frodo, not forgetting Pippin, who was great too. However I do believe that Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Karl Urban (Eomer) didn't get enough screen time, but hopefully Return of the King will change that. All in all a brilliant film, I didn't even realises the three hours it went for. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different movie from the first - a few quibbles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was looking forward to the second movie with great anticipation after enjoying the first movie tremendously. I saw the movie on its first day of release in NZ, the 19th of Dec 2002.The movie was intense, emotional and breathtaking. The wide pan helicopter scenery shots were incredible. Gollum, as may others viewers have sugegsted, was an incredible work of CGI/real character brilliance and gave real life, humor and humanity to Smeagol/Gollum. Gimli also added a bit of comic relief throughout the movie which was good to break up the intensity. The film left me more emotionally mved to sadness than the first, however it was extremely well done.Brad Dourif as Wormtounge excelled and liked the casting of Miranada Otto as Eowyn. Bernard Hill was a different Theoden to how I perceived him in the book, however was put in a good performance.I found that the dialouge was a bit heavier this time with some of it I could recall straight out of the book. However, I didnt enjoy how PC treated the relationship between Arwen / Aragorn went or how Elrond dispises humans. I also didn't like how the Elves turned up at Helms Deep or how Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. My idea of the "rolling hills of Rohan" was not really what appeared on the screen either.Howver, apart from these things, I'm sure the second installment will grow on me over time and it kept on reminding me of the second installment in another great Trilogy, Star Wars (IV, V and VI).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at reviews worldwide, they tend to focus on all the great elements of this movie as if existing on their own. They talk about how brilliant Gollum is portrayed both technically aswell as acting-wise (which is true), or they talk about how the battle at helm's deep is the biggest battle-scene ever produced on celluloid (wich is also true). But my main praise for this movie is that it works as a complete picture, and it's sum is even greater than it's parts.With the two towers you've got a story which is, well, a nightmare to translate to screen. No beginning, no real end, two different storylines, told in such a way that they don't seem to connect (which in the book is no problem, but it just doesn't work in a motion picture like this).But when I look at Peter Jackson's film, I cannot see any weakness in it's story. Even though it hasn't got a real beginning and ending, it does open with a bang, and ends with a BIG bang, and the picture comes to a more satisfying conclusion than FOTR.Next to this all the technical elements are once again flawless. Shore's score works, in my opinion, just that bit better than his FOTR score, the FX are not even in the same league as FOTR's, their waaaay above them. Acting is great once again, with special praise to the actors portraying Aragorn, Theoden and Gollum.So is this movie perfect? Well close, in the same way FOTR was. But that's a personal opinion. I do understand that people don't like the change to Faramir's character, even though I liked them, and I do understand people don't always appreciate Gimli's humor, even though I thought it worked extremely well. Also I have to say that the ending is in some parts a tad unconvincing and unsatisfying. The way Faramir changes his view seems abrupt, and you really don't see much of the characters reactions after Helm's deep, but that is probably saved for ROTK, wich will surely be even better.....All in all, I have to say, I DO like this one better than FOTR, because it's tighter told, has a more satisfying conclusion, is much more breathtaking, if it was ever possible, and it just flows better. But the best compliment might be; It is a perfect followup to FOTR, expanding on it, while remaining faithfull to the feeling of part 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a movie, this is a brilliant piece of work. It's complex, well-crafted, and painstakingly put together. As an adaptation however, The Two Towers is awful. Perhaps it's just because I'm a Tolkien purist, but I found the missing plot points to be upsetting; not only do I feel that they were co-opted by what seems to be a better version of "The Exorcist-Power-of-Christ-Compels-You" scene(s), but there's probably a whole generation of people out there who're going to accept the movie as truth and not realize how much they're missing. The breaking of Saruman's staff, the loss of the palantir (for those of you who haven't read the books, that's the glowing stone Saruman is so frequently depicted with, holding it under his palm); the actual "arousal" of the Ents, which in the movie came across as sheer bad reverse-psychology (yes, of course, we'll trick the eons-old wise beings, aren't we clever?). And just out of curiousity, when did Faramir become such a putz? What about the death of Theoden? The battle with the Nazgul? Eowyn's sacrifice? And why in the WORLD would Elrond (who is half-Elven and half human) decide that he despises all humans? There's a curious inconsistency, within both the movie's "romance" idea, which is absolutely stupid. It doesn't happen in the book, and it shouldn't be in the movie--it's misleading and quite frankly, destroys the chemistry between two (unnamed) characters.In all fairness, I have to admit that as a cinematic piece, I found that "The Two Towers" was quite spectacular. While I hesitate to gush and rave as many do, that this is "THE BEST FILM EVER!!!", it must be said that you could certainly do far worse with your money. The acting is excellent; Gollum/Smeagol is characterized in an absolutely fascinating manner, with a wonderful theatrical device; the battle with the Balrog is just phenomenal, and the vistas breathtaking. Again, it has to be said--the movie is terrific; the adaptation leaves much to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No better than Attack of the Clones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment of the 'Lord of the Rings',Trilogy, the Two Towers, is not a bad movie... but in saying this, its nowhere near as brilliant as some have perported it to be.The cast, the landscape, and the directing are all good (although more Christopher Lee would have been nice). Unfortunitly, the storyline is very slow, and at times, very boring. Peter Jackson has done a great job transforming and tinkering Tolkeins work into something movie viewers can enjoy, but, sad as it may be, even Jackson must have struggled to turn a story so mind numbingly tedious into a screenplay. Dont get me wrong, the main events depicted in the story are interesting - its just that these good bits are intersperced with some very boring and rather unnecissary storytelling. Despite Jacksons best efforts, these bits are evident on the screen and this is why the movie is too long.I have read comments raving about what a great acheivement the battle of Helms Deep was. I dont know where these people have been living, but the Battle of Helms Deep was not as amazing and jaw droping as some say. Infact, it was really just a run of the mill battle sequence which can be seen in many movies to have been released in the last few years- the battle at the end of 'Attack of the Clones' was just as good, and in saying this 'The Two Towers' was no better than the latest Star Wars film.7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There must be a lot of Tolkien readers hyping up the movie 'cos unfortunately it seems like this movie was created for their watching pleasure only. The movie requires that you be familiar with the plots, subplots, characters and vocabulary that are in the books and that makes it hard for us ordinary mortals to follow what's going on at all. The movie becomes too long because of this too. I'm sure there are superfluous scenes that can be trimmed without disturbing the overall storyline.But the biggest problem I had with this movie is that there is a sense of detachment that I get when watching it, that I end up being an observer rather than getting involved in the thick of it all. It's like watching "The Longest Day" instead of "Star Wars" (the original ones that is).I am not asking for the movie to follow a formulaic Hollywood style storyline, I just want a simpler script. But then again this movie was created for the fans by a fan, not for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as brilliant and amazing as the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Year ago when I went to watch the unbelievable first part of this magnificent new movie trilogy I read "The Fellowship of the ring", the first part of Tolkien's larger-than-life book classic in advance. My intention was to read "The Two towers" also right before I watch it in the theater but someone suggested in the IMDb review that the second film is not quite as loyal to the original story than the first one and it would be actually better to see the film first. I don't know if it's the wisest decision but I haven't read the book yet. Well I loved the film anyway.This brilliant movie gets so much praise I imagine it would be even refreshing to write a really negative review about it but I have to let someone else to do the dirty job because I simply can't criticize this flawless, excellent masterpiece. The masterful Peter Jackson did what many thought would be impossible. I guess the middle part of the trilogy is always the hardest one to do and in this case the success was just phenomenal. This is the reason why we have movie theaters and generally films at all.Like its sensational predecessor, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two towers" is a movie for all senses. The amazing experience is so comprehensive, so thrilling, so visually exciting artwork it just lefts the audience speechless. Only word that comes out is "wow", and that's it. The film is so good it's almost unreal. Honestly, these films make Star wars look so out of date and useless. Of course it's easy to say the story isn't too ingenious, profound or complicated but this is the greatest proof it doesn't necessarily mean the film is bad. Outstanding "The Lord of the Rings" -trilogy is the best thing that has happened to the movie world for decades. Only problem is, there another one year wait ahead for the final part. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. This film is loved by nearly everyone on the face of this earth, and is, of course, high in the top 250 at imdb.com. I don't really get it, but I guess it's not my thing. Should be certainly true, especially when it's loved so feverishly much.I don't know what to say; it didn't keep my interest really. There were some pretty well done moments, but there were moments (long, long moments) where I was either bored out of my mind or nitpicking the CGI.Good thing is that there's nothing wrong with any of the CGI. It's nearly flawless. Sadly, it seemed like the whole damn movie was made out of CGI. I was noticing how much there was of it, and I realized nearly three quarters through that all I was really doing was seeing how the CGI worked into scenes. What a distraction. I know Jackson wanted the battle scenes to be filled with millions of people, but couldn't he used close up shots of real people (less, but still a lot)? It's definitely possible. Look at some battle scenes from movies made before 1997.And the cinematography got down right muddled and uninteresting at points. Except for the rare nice shots, the whole movie seemed to be filmed with the same sweeping camera movements (over the battle scenes) and used the brown looking color scheme a bit too much.The characters themselves aren't very interesting. Frodo gets downright annoying sometimes. I'm sorry to say I've never read any of the books, and I can only imagine what it did for the characters in them. They're probably wonderful, imaginative, compelling stories. If so, this film is ultimately generic.All I'm saying is that it's not my cup of tea. Obviously, it's millions of others. That's cool though.What would be even cooler is if I could show some of these hardcore fans Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures." I wonder how much they'd like "The Two Towers" then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second installment of the 'Lord of the Rings',Trilogy, the Two Towers, is not a bad movie... but in saying this, its nowhere near as brilliant as some have perported it to be.The cast, the landscape, and the directing are all good (although more Christopher Lee would have been nice). Unfortunitly, the storyline is very slow, and at times, very boring. Peter Jackson has done a great job transforming and tinkering Tolkeins work into something movie viewers can enjoy, but, sad as it may be, even Jackson must have struggled to turn a story so mind numbingly tedious into a screenplay. Dont get me wrong, the main events depicted in the story are interesting - its just that these good bits are intersperced with some very boring and rather unnecissary storytelling. Despite Jacksons best efforts, these bits are evident on the screen and this is why the movie is too long.I have read comments raving about what a great acheivement the battle of Helms Deep was. I dont know where these people have been living, but the Battle of Helms Deep was not as amazing and jaw droping as some say. Infact, it was really just a run of the mill battle sequence which can be seen in many movies to have been released in the last few years- the battle at the end of 'Attack of the Clones' was just as good, and in saying this 'The Two Towers' was no better than the latest Star Wars film.7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>selling LOTR to the public</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>before you jump on me for blasphemy, i rated this movie 8 out of 10. i'm not going to go into what i liked about it. suffice it to say that i feel it was pretty complete, very well acted, and of course the production is incredible. almost perfect.so just let me give you 5 reasons why it's not 10/10:1. the CG grandness is ANNOYING (but at least not as annoying as in the Fellowship). how many times must we take a flight through various caverns and structures, rotating impossibly around the towers, basically the stuff of the Back To The Future ride at Universal or the Star Wars ride at Disney. are movies going to learn from video game cut-scenes and computer graphic demos? or shouldn't it be the other way around? i can forgive this tho, CG is still fairly young and i'm praying that CG directors will finally get off the "we can do it therefore we should" and start thinking about ART.2. Why was Gimli turned into comic relief? To reach some strange audience? do the producers think the movie wouldn't sell if we didn't make fun of a short guy? uncool. just uncool. Gimli is a dark and tragic character in the *REAL* LOTR. i cannot forgive this.3. all those sad women and children at Helmsgate. Awwwwww. what a waste of screen time. reminded me of the horrors of Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome and the SCI FI channel version of Dune. ugh. edit that filler out. put in more dialog to explain the reasons why Rohan and Gondor are not (yet) working together. that was such an important part of the book and it's not well explained in the movie.4. Aragorn's love life blown out of proportion. a friend of mine says it's probably directed at the female viewers as Vigo is a hotty. but again, an unnecessary drawing out of an already long movie. but i can forgive this, Tolkien's Two Towers was pretty cold, a little love ain't a bad thing. just a little too much of it. it broke the story apart too much.5. Legolas skateboarding down the stairs while shooting his bow at the orcs. now this i cannot even fathom. is Jackson MAD??? i know, 10 seconds in a 3+ hour movie. but i almost screamed in anguish when i saw that. it wasn't even well done. it happens out of the blue and it's unclear even what Legolas was riding. was it a shield? a piece of wood? an Element deck with Darkstar wheels? those stupid stupid 360 frames of film. we hates it. we hates it forever!--the Two Towers was a very gloomy book. a difficult read. i can understand why Jackson would want to liven it up a bit. but he went too far. good thing there was enough in the movie to make up for it (gollum, the dead marshes, and the continuing ability for Jackson and his crew to tell a very difficult story in the visual medium)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The difficult middle bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sounds to me as if some people are disappointed that they haven't just witnessed their own personal epiphany on celluloid (or digitally projected where available). If you are one of these people, I feel sorry for you. You are missing a truly wonderful experience and probably one of the best cinematic adaptations from source material there is around. Don't worry, those treasured images conjured from reading the books will still be there after you've seen the film. Maybe they'll even be improved. Plus, you can always read the books again afterwards.This film is the equal of the magnificent 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. The themes are different of course and the feeling is possible even more traditionally Epic. You get swept along with the whole experience, you feel the devastation of Rohan, the assault on Helm's Deep, the possibility of the extinction of men. The portrayal of the effect of the Ring is magnificent. Frodo's pain and fall into its grip are clear across the screen as Frodo's dependence on Sam to keep him going grows. Gollum/Smeagol is the best use of a CGI character I've yet seen on film, praise which should not detract from the Ents, Fell Beasts and Wargs. The assault of Helm's Deep in stunning mostly because of the clarity of editing and narrative at what could be a very confusing moment. At all points it is clear what is going on and how desperate the situation is becoming.The only slight criticism I have (and it's only tiny and not enough to stop me giving the film a 10), is that it feels as though there's something missing. You'll know what I mean if you've seen the extend Fellowship DVD. The extra footage in that seems to round out that film and complete it. I already can't wait for the extended DVD of the Two Towers.So, you must see this even if you think that Elves and Dwarves are a little bit silly. Peter Jackson has made a stunning film out of what could have been the hardest book of the three adapt. Possibly the best epic film series there has yet been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is probably my favourite of all times. All the characters are absolutely terrificly displayed, and the actors chosen for the roles perfect! I sincerely hope Ian McKellen will accept the part of Albus Dumbledore in "Harry Potter", as he is a great wizard in LOTR. Peter Jackson has managed to create a spectacular adventure on screen. The different worlds that Tolkien created are so thorough, and it is amazing to see how Jackson and his team have managed to capture this. Hopefully we will be able to see "the Hobbit" turned into such a masterpiece one day.Absolutely brilliant and spellbinding!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When am I supposed to go get popcorn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty fast paced adventure. I managed to find a spot about 1/2 way through the movie where there was some kissing and hugging when I finally thought I could go get some refreshments and not miss anything. Good luck trying to keep up with all the changes, all the backstabbing, and all the fighting. Some rather amazing special effects.One thing that amazed me though was the way that the theater delivered the sound. It all came from the front of the theater, even though there were speakers all around the audience. I felt cheated in this regard. I haven't read weather others had this same poor sound experience or not. Hopefully. it was just this screwy place and that isn't how the movie is being shipped out. Then, 20 minutes into the movie, the sound level dropped and your hearing people crunching popcorn and slurping drinks instead of the movie. Grrrr ....Luckily, that just lasted another 15 minutes.All in all, a very good movie that I would highly recommend, but only if you saw the first movie. Otherwise, I am sure you shall be lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elijah Wood is great, absolutly great! He fit the part of Frodo well...He could not have played any OTHER role in The Lord of the Rings. If you look carefully at his expressions throughout both movies, it's great. He shows exactly what he's feeling through expressions on his face. I have not seen anyone that can do that like he does. In TIME Magizine December 2, 2002 edition,"The Elijah Effect" Director Harry Wood, says "He has an ability, more than anybody I've ever met, to convey everything he's feeling through his eyes." That is so TRUE. Which makes him perfect for the role. Its a great movie. It's best that it is seperated into 3 movies to get in all the details of the original book. Or rather than a 9 hr movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't read the story until last summer. I read it all. I hadn't given it a second look by the time Two Towers came out. One thing about the storyline needs to be addressed ASAP: THERE WERE NO ELVES AT HELM'S DEEP! Nowhere in the text are any more than one elf, Legolas, even mentioned. There is no mention of the Last Alliance of Men and Elves at the defeat of Sauron, like in the prologue of Fellowhip. Eowyn was not at Helm's Deep, but that addition to the story is understandable, it makes female parts bigger. There is no mention of the Entwash and no mention of when Merry and Pippin drink from it, they end up being four or five inches taller than they were before drinking the water. The Entmoot was smaller in the movie, but digital characters take a lot of time to render, so that is understandable as well. I think that New Line and the producers of this movie messed big time even before releasing the movie. They showed Gandalf in the trailers. That is one of the best parts of all the Middle Earth stories, when Gandalf comes back from death and you think it's Saruman. By showing in the trailers that he is alive, it removes almost all of the suspense. I think that this was an idea of the people of New Line more than it was on the part of Mr. Jackson. I think he would have realized this but New Line had the final say. I hope this was the case. I give this theatrical version an 8 out of ten because of all the missing stuff and craptacular addition of the elves at Helm's Deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better perhaps, but I didn't enjoy it as much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second film of the trilogy makes me glad I saw the first one, and whets my appetite for the third. But as a film by itself, yeesh. I mean, it's lousy to be like a bride after her honeymoon thinking, "that was really nice honey...(but is that all you've got?)" Which is to say no, the fireworks did not go off for me this time.So why didn't they? I mean, if you enjoy battle scenes you'll love Two Towers. All it needs is a couple of play by play announcers from Monday Night Football to make it really complete. "We're here with Gimli the dwarf, talking to him about that big play in front of the castle gate. Gimli, weren't you a little nervous when Aragon tossed you into that army of sword-swinging mutants, or have you two handled that play before?"Maybe it was two or three too many helicopter shots, round and round and round and ....oh no, Gravol please! Peter Jackson, I love ya, we love ya, and the New Zealand Department of Tourism loves ya, but you've got to come up with some different stuff!Maybe it was seeing so much of Gollum, in such detail, when he's a lot sicklier in my imagination. Maybe it was talking trees that looked like, well, computer-animated talking trees. Overall, my impression of Two Towers is more, but less. More is happening, but less is memorable. The characters are more developed, but they're less charming. The cinematography is again stoo-pendous, but in ways that we've seen before. Like Olympic competition, when you've the bar so high, further gains come in increments.Fellowship of the Ring blew me away. Two Towers, as good as it is, just blew over.</fullReview>

At the same time, Aragorn and the remaining members of the fellowship must lead a band of warriors in the fight against Saruman's fierce army. Astonishing visuals, exciting battles, plus a surprising and clever sense of humor make it an entertaining follow-up, but the story often drags leaving it without quite the impact of the first installment. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was a great film. Far superior to those dull films about a galaxy far away. Expectations were high for the second film in the trilogy and The Two Towers (TTT) almost made it. Perhaps the battle at Helm's Deep went on a touch too long and uncanonical scenes like Aragorn being lost were unneccessary but these are only minor flaws in an engrossing three hours. There was much to praise. Part of the success of TTT depends upon the Gollum as he is now a key character in the story and as other people have said, you forget that the character is a CGI. It is extraordinary. The interplay between Gollum and Frodo and Sam is brilliant, not just physically but emotionally. If Gollum had been another JarJar Binks it would have been disastrous but he is a real character, at war with himself. The acting varies from mock-epic to perfect. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's pain so tangible that you feel every difficult step in his journey. Sean Astin's speech near the end about finding good in the world made my eyes moist. Viggo Mortensen is better in TTT than FOTR. Liv Tyler looks the part. Bernard Hill is Theoden come to life. And Miranda Otto is my kind of shield maiden.The production values are wonderful as ever and if it is eye candy it is of the superior kind. Well done Peter Jackson and team. My only real complaint is that we have to wait another dratted year for the third part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly one of the most entertaining and engrossing films I've seen in a long, long time. Sure, other recent films have been really great... Spiderman was a great movie this past summer. But few are so epic and big that they're grand. This is a movie that will forever be remembered in cinema history because it contains all of the elements that make a movie stand the test of time. Lots of movies are forgotten or merely overlooked after a few years pass, but then there are those that you always remember because of the wonderful feeling they bring you when watching them. You know your watching one of the greats when your completely taken out of your own life, you feel like your IN the movie. When all your troubles are not on your mind for at least a few hours. You know it's one of the best movies you've ever seen when everything on screen looks like it is real. Even the CGI in this movie is merged so well with real shots that you don't really think "hey that's fake!" That's quite an accomplishment in today's movies.Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is.. like a lot of films.. a little more interesting than it's original movie, since the plot of the film has basically already been sat in motion and we can jump right into the story and all the action. But because the three films are really one story and not three seperate stories, like the books themselves, you can't really rate one movie over the other. Just see it as one big story.... The Lord of the Rings.and of course, who couldn't love this story. I have a feeling Return of the King is going to be the better of them all. I can't wait! It's only a year! ;)</fullReview>

Too much Mission Impossible 2 kind of stuff, too much computerized special effects, not to mention 500 guys beating 10000... Gimli looked a lot like Obelix shoving Orcs (who as we all know are light chaps) down the bridge.The whole LOTR thing is impressive, by its greatness, its beauty and everything, but I've seen better stories, definitely better movies, definitely better acting...I almost feel guilty for not having liked the movie. But the truth is it's missing some things. There are several parts where it is boring and other parts where it is vulgar (those philosophical dialogues between Sam and Frodo are bad).I'm very generous with my ratings, so this still gets 8/10. But I've given 9s and 10s to plenty other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, I am a Die Hard Star Wars Fan. I never cared much for anything about LOTR or the hobbit until the movies came out. I went to watch the film only because I had nothing to do that day, only to be turned into one of the best fans of this story. Never read the books but I intend to now. Its unbelievable how stories like these are hidden like treasures waiting to be found. This is story that i would like to tell my children because it has the stuff heroes are made of. Not only because of the battle scenes, but because the characters are all from different backgrounds, races, gender and beliefs really do not care for one anther so as long as they leave each other alone. Kind of like our world. With the difference of a very few who realize the danger their world is in and decide to go against the odds, which is the attitude this world should have. The heroes of this story forget their backgrounds, beliefs, and differences for the search of a better life in which all live for the better. A story of honor, friendship unconditional love and just knowing that you should always try to do what you think is right. To be honest that is an interesting life the characters live in this epic. I am not one to really write or read a lot or even do what I'm doing right now but i must say this tale has changed my life. Well this is just to let you know all you LOTR fans you can count with a SW fan too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better - but not for the right reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Tolkien's trilogy is one of the most overrated works of literature ever produced. And no I'm not stupid, and yes, I can read long books (I love Moby-Dick, one of the best black humor stories ever written). I am, also, a fantasy fan. I don't think they're bad books because I can't appreciate fantasy or philosophy, but simply because they're poorly written and plotted. I made it 3/4 of the way through TFOTR before giving up. That said, I think Jackson's films are a VAST improvement over the books, and the second film much better than the first. Why? Because Jackson gives me pretty pictures and one very fine Viggo Mortensen to look at for three hours. Distracted by the pretty landscape and Aragorn's cheekbones, I can ignore the fact that character development is non-existent and emotional manipulation runs rampant. LOTR is really nothing more than a shallow action story with banal bits of philosophy floating through it. FOTR tries so hard to create character development and empathy, but fails miserably (I never understood why Arwen was so upset when she thought Frodo was dead, they had just met). All the music swelling, let's-have-a-deep-moment scenes were terrible. But TTT dispenses with most of this faux feeling and focuses instead on the action. This at least is entertaining and funny, unlike the endless walking in FOTR, interrupted by gravely somber discussions on how are we going to save the world. (Incidentally, there is some great character work in TTT, but it's found in Gollum, who has already been so praised here that I don't think I need say anymore on him. All the positive comments are true concerning him.) But there is no true friendship between Legolas and Gimli, no true love between Aragorn and Arwen, and the elves seem more like doped-up supermodels than mystical beings. The films carry no astounding message about the value of friendship or the struggle between good and evil (what, in life, is ever simply black and white?). When they try to be philopshical, they fail miserably. TTT has less "think-talk" than FOTR, which is very good. But the dialogue, oh god, the dialogue. It's terrible, not one single truly memorable line. This is straight from Tolkien and his own failure to write grippingly. "I think we have tarried here too long," Frodo says, before being captured by Faramir. Who, in real life, says crap like that? There's no tension, no laughter, no brilliance. It's Shakespearean language, but without Shakeseare's wit, double entendres, and dirty jokes. Bottom line, TTT is a great action flick for those who enjoy sword fights and gritty looking men (which I do - hey, we all have our shallow sides). But if you're looking for the best film of all time, look somewhere else. FOTR and TTT aren't even the best fantasy films ever made. That title, IMO, can be possessed only by Reiner's The Princess Bride. Memorable dialogue, wit, love, action, murder, revenge, The Princess Bride has it all - and clocks in at under three hours. Before you go see TTT for the gazillionth time, rent this delightful parody of fantasy and then tell me I'm wrong.</fullReview>

This movie has a completely different feel from the Fellowship (with the help of Howard Shore) and is an excellent movie, easily the best of the year. If it doesn't win BEST PICTURE Oscar, then the Academy Awards will be rigged again this year like it was last year. I can't wait for THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was in my opinion was the film highlight of 2001. The Two Towers although a good film, is not as good as the first one. The first film opened up with a fantastic prologue, showing how the ring came into being, and the war of the ring. The second opens up with a scene as good if not better than than the first, of Gandalfs battle with the Balrog. Sam and Frodo's quest goes on, with stunning scenes overlooking Mordor and the Dead Marshes, when they are joined by Gollum. In this film WETA workshops outdid themselves with Gollum and Treebeard, the opinion of most is that these characters were better than anticipated, not alot of people realise how much effort WETA put into these films, as they create nearly everything you see on screen ( i.e armour, minatures, make-up etc). New scenes, that were not in the book have been added, which at the time seemed quite pointless, but for instance during the battle with the Wargs, Aragorn goes over the side of a cliff, leaving Legolas and Gimli to mourn, however of course, Aragorn does die, I didnt see the relevance of this, until I thought about how it shows the bond that these characters have made since they left Rivendell. In the Fellowship, Merry and Pippin were used to delivier the comic relief, however in this film they play the serious role of trying to get the Ents to attack Isengaurd, they are replaced by Gimli, whilst his jokes are funny at times, there are other occasions where his jokes are irrelevant and sometimes break the tension, that is often needed. The stunts in this film are quite remarkable, those of you who have seen it will know what I mean when I say the name Legolas, for the rest of you, you will know what I mean when you see it. While the film is great and amazing in places i.e Helms Deep, it does not delivier its emotions as well as the first, the love between Arwen and Aragorn although strong isn't deliviered as well, as quite a lot of the film is centered around their love, tension isn't delivered very well at all, with Gimli breaking most of it. And terror, in the first film the Nazgul are seen as being quite terrifying, but in this one their, almost comical looking winged beasts do not create the terror the Nazgul on horses did. However do not let my comments put you off, as it is an extremely good film, but doesnt quite live up to the first installment, don't let my comments make you be the only one to not see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the movie twice, I will offer the following as possible subtitles:"A Horse When You Need It" or "A Blue Eyed Movie"Comments on the first: Is it just me, or did it seem that steeds appeared semi-miraculously when needed? There is at least one scene where everyone I have seen the movie with said the same thing, "where did the horses come from?" (At points I half-expected a puff of smoke, *POOF* and a horse.)And on the second: The vast majority of characters have blue eyes. As far as I can tell the list of characters that DON'T are: Gimli, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Saruman, Eomer, Eowyn, a smattering of extras and then "non-humanoids" such as Ents and Orcs. Everyone else does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh! Puh-lease! It's unbearable to keep hearing people how much they like this mess! I can no longer remember siting in a movie where I DON'T care what's going on because I don't care if Frodo destroys the ring and I don't care that Gandalf is White, gray or Pink!. It's horribly edited and goofy. For one moment I thought I was living in 1984 watching " The Never Ending Story" when I saw those bearded waking trees. I'd like to comment, as well, in how much trailers cheat! I was hoping to see more than the two minutes of Liv Tyler in the film (who I considered the most delicious acting in the entire cast) and discover that she spends as much time in the movie as she does in the trailer, but I guess that this is enough to put her face in the poster. But eventhough Liv Tyler was the only thing I cared for(well, i liked the Gollum a little), I wondered whose stupid idea wa when they decided to mix dialogues in elvish and english! I mean, this is not The U.S. border where people speak in spanish and are responded in english.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opportunity Missed (Spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!My main objections to this film are based in the fact that I am a hopeless Tolkien purist. You've all met people like me: we started playing Dungeons and Dragons because it was modeled on Tolkien; we did Halloween dressed as Rangers, Elven Warriors, and the like; we found places to get real swords; we made our own chain mail; we can sit and discuss the LOTR books ad infinitum and even quote dialogue; we bought and read The Silmarillion in hardcover as soon as it hit the shelves; and we all secretly loved, while publicly denigrating, the cartoon version of The Hobbit with Orson Bean as the voice of Bilbo. I first read the books in about 1976, at the behest of my 6th-grade English teacher, to whom I still owe an immense debt. I have read the trilogy literally dozens of times. I've read it three times in an Italian translation. I read it out loud to my kids. Well, you get the picture.Now that you know that about me, the following will be understandable. I thought it was an OK movie. Technically, it was magnificent; the filming every bit as majestic or epic or whatever adjective you want to use, as FOTR. The actors did nice work (although Elijah Wood is not stellar at portraying the ever-growing weight of the burden of the Ring). I even think Liv Tyler is a passable Arwen. What I didn't like was the fact that, in a couple of instances in this movie, the filmmakers took liberties with parts of the story line gratuitously. I can see doing some things differently for visual effect, since any movie "watches" different than its book reads. However, in this film more so than in The Fellowship of the Ring, the makers made changes that were unnecessary for dramatic effect, but were more geared toward the action-adventure angle. There were some changes that were more effective dramatically, but I objected to a couple of fairly major things.First, the whole sub-story about Eomer, Eowyn, Theoden, and the Kingdom of Rohan got bollixed up for no reason. Eomer was not banished in the book, and didn't need to be banished in the movie, to achieve the drama in the rejuvenation of Theoden. In fact, this little ad-lib actually made it more difficult to get him and his band of Riders (what? Did they all go into banishment with him?) back into the fight in Helm's Deep. And he got Gandalf's best line, the one where he asks Wormtongue, "How long?" How long since he sold out and was to receive from a victorious Saruman his share of the spoils, and the woman he has long coveted? Eomer gets that line, and he gets it too early. He's long-gone, instead of being released from his cell in time to join Aragorn and company after Theoden perks up.In the books, Gandalf (now returned from the dead, dressed in radiant white, remember) talks to Theoden and helps him break the spell of lethargy and the despair that Wormtongue has poisoned his mind with. There's very little implication that Wormy has worked any actual magic on Theoden in the book. Rather, he has helped Theoden always see the negative, and he falls into depression and despair. Gandalf, bringer of hope and new life, gives him back his pride and his desire to do good, defend his people, go out in glory if go out he must. Instead, in the book, we get a Theoden who is actually possessed by Saruman, and must be literally exorcised; he then becomes visibly younger as Saruman is "cast out." Excuse me, but if Saruman could possess Theoden, what need was there for Wormtongue? And why hadn't Theoden/Saruman just concluded an alliance with Isengard? The book version is a lot more credible, and could have been done with equal or greater drama. Real drama, not the cheap-thrill drama of the exorcism scene. The whole thing was as unfair to Gandalf and to Saruman as the "Saruman Meets Gandalf in WWF ACTION!!!!" fight scene in the FOTR film.To add insult to injury, this new, younger Theoden then becomes a constant bitcher and whiner in Helm's Deep. Just shut up and fight, Your Majesty. The less-glorious, less "Numenorean" dignity and majesty of the King of the Rohirrim is lost; a dignity and majesty that is homier and more easily understood by the simple salt-of-the-earth Hobbits than the more refined, esoteric, rarified Numenorean lords. He could have been the kind and noble King to whom Merry freely gives his sword in the books, but no, it's more "dramatic" to make him, first, a possessed, hag-ridden dotard, and then a futile whiner.Minor points on this story line: Eowyn is left in Edoras; she doesn't go to Helm's Deep. No Elvish army ever shows up at Helm's Deep - what the heck was that all about, anyway? It's Erkenbrand with the remnants of the army of the Westfold who shows up at the last minute, not Eomer and his Riders-in-Exile. The Isengard army is supposed to be destroyed by the Huorns, the nasty semi-Ents - where were they? Wouldn't have been dramatic to have shown the awe on the faces of the defenders at the sight of the new forest, the Orc army fleeing into the trees, and its disappearance the next morning? And you could have done it all in the time it took to have that darn Elvish army march in. Instead, Eomer, who shouldn't have been banished, shows up with an army that shouldn't have followed him into banishment, and they save the day, somewhat less than credibly given the numbers stated - 400 against 10,000.I have to say that Brad Dourif, the guy who did Wormtongue was phenomenal. Very nice job!Next, Treebeard and the Ents lost some gravity and credibility. In the book they didn't tell Merry and Pippin they wouldn't help, and they didn't suddenly change their minds when they saw the stumps on the borders of Fangorn near Isengard. They were the shepherds of the trees, for heaven's sake. They already knew about the depredations, hated the Orcs, and Treebeard had already been thinking of doing something about Saruman. They lost the deep, intense dignity and wisdom they have by virtue of being the oldest living creatures in Middle Earth. The humorous banter and friendship between Treebeard and the Hobbits could have been, but was not, developed. Again, the time to do so could have been gained by cutting the dumb parts.Third, Faramir was dealt a grave injustice, and he is no doubt rolling over on his bier in Rath Dinen. He is one of the few truly noble characters in the book, and the filmmakers succumbed to the temptation to give him a dark side. In the book he treats Frodo and Sam as honored guests, and gives them safe passage in all of Gondor except Henneth Annun. In the movie, he basically tries to shanghai them back to Minas Tirith to bring the Ring to Gondor, and is only convinced to let them go when they draw the wrath of the Ringwraith, once he's dragged them all the way back to Osgiliath. In releasing them, he is reminded by a lieutenant that his life is subject to forfeit by so doing, even though he is a Captain of Gondor and the Heir of the Steward. Wanna bet this is the setup to another Dumb Dramatic Scene in the 3d movie? Anyway, Faramir loses all of his nobility and becomes only one shade better than his brother Boromir. The contrast between noble, etherial Faramir and earthy, temporal Boromir, as Faramir laments his brother's death, wouldn't have been all that hard to do in the movie, but again, the makers chose action/adventure over real drama.Gollum was very well-done, computer-animated with Andy Serkis. I've been trying unsuccessfully for years to visualize Gollum in my mind, and this is a rare case when the movie version just might fit the bill. Aside from a slight resemblance to Yoda ("When carry the Ring as long as did I you have, evil will you be also!"), Gollum is done really well. The interplay between Smeagol and Gollum is done especially well, with the contrast heightened by some cool camera angle work.Small complaint about FOTR, since she makes a cameo appearance in a sort of flashback in TTT: Cate Blanchett is absolutely horrible as Galadriel, and I can't decide if that's Blanchett's fault or lousy script and direction. I'd have liked to see what that actress, who only has one character, would have done had her script required her to play the "real" Galadriel. She reminded me of Morgan Le Fay in "Excalibur" (the Helen Mirren role). Galadriel was warm, stern, noble, loving and lovabale in the books; the Blanchett version is harsh, hissy, mysterious, cruel and cold. She reminds me of one of those overdone Goth chicks you meet late at night in espresso bars, except in white robes. There's no "touchability" to her at all and no way for the hobbits and others to relate to her in the movies, whereas they all relate to her quite well in the book. I have heard that, iin the extended DVD version of FOTR, there's some cut scenes that develop Gimli's crush on Galadriel, and I will be interested to see how they do this, since I'm not sure Blanchett is capable of holding up her end of it.Well, that's about it. Not a bad movie, but not one to please the dramatist or the Tolkien purist. A little too much action/adventure and not enough real drama, and plot weaknesses created out of whole cloth and papered over by special effects and frankly brilliant filming. Still a must-see, still a success, but tragically less than it could have been, and less than this long-time Tolkien fan would have liked. Opportunity lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>************NOTE - SOME MINOR SPOILERS**************Got to see this new one on Saturday and had a few quick thoughts. First off, a disclaimer - I have never read the full trilogy. I skimmed over the Fellowship Of The Ring when I was about 12 years old but got bogged down in the multitude of characters and plot twists. I do know that the books are some of the best written in the 20th century and am impressed so far with Peter Jackson's direction of the stories. Now, The Two Towers is a "good" movie. Much better than a lot of the crap Hollywood shovels out normally. However, compared to Fellowship falls a little short.First off, I didn't get a sense for much of the humanity in this film that I got in the first one. Not until the end does Sam make a little monologue about the nature of "goodness" and how it is worth fighting for. There are other moments when the King is talking about the nature of war and Treebeard talks about the attitude of the forest and that stuff works but I didn't "feel" as much this time around.Secondly, in the first film there was a great scene where Boromir dies because he couldn't resist the temptation of the Ring. In his final words to Aragorn, he talks about this and how he realized it was his downfall. This kind of 3-dimensional characterizing is what made the Fellowship a success to me; instead of copping typical Hollywood cliches about "good and evil", we find conflicted anti-heroes you can believe. In this movie there is simply too much "Jar Jar Dwarf" in the character of Gimli. Too many throw-away silly lines about his height, tossing dwarfs, etc. This dialogue really brought a cheezy feel to what should be a proud and dignified (though slight) character.Also along the lines of "cheezy", don't get me started on the elf "shield-boarding" down the stairs during the climactic battle scene near the end. Scenes like this come across as pandering to the younger crowd and rob the film (and books) of its inherent dignity. Someone with a feel for the books (Jackson himself?) shoulda stepped in and stopped this silliness.There was also less development of the villains in this one. Brad Dourif could've made for a great villain as Grima Wormtongue (as he was as Pieter in David Lynch's somewhat flawed Dune). But in spite of a few bits of interesting dialog he disappears only to be found floundering around Saruman's feet. And Saruman himself doesn't hold up nearly as evil while looking desperate when Treebeard and gang attack Isengard. Gollum is an interesting, conflicted anti-hero (along the lines of Boromir - but even more demented because of the power of the Ring) that was developed somewhat with interesting monologues (though hard to understand at times). But there didn't seem to be enough of these fellows (sans Gollum and his soliloquies). Overall, those helping Sauron are interesting baddies and I wouldve liked to see more from them (especially Christopher Lee's Saruman). Lets hope we get more in the next installment.Alas, for all these deficiencies, there are some truly inspired moments in The Two Towers. Obviously the storming of the keep at the end is some of the greatest film-making ever (no over-exaggeration there either). Jackson and crew truly made you feel like you were watching the CNN-televised take on this historic event. The CGI was very seamless (even Gollum looked real when a lesser FX crew could've made him look fake) and as a matter of fact I was very impressed with how the movie kept the consistent look and feel of the Fellowship. Of course, it was always great to see Gandalf again - Ian McKellan IS this character through and through (such a great actor).In the end, The Two Towers ranks as one of the better action films I've seen but didn't hold my interest as well as its predecessor. I was wondering when it would end just before the big battle, whereas I found myself a bit sad during Fellowship when it was clear that movie was about over (how many 3 hour+ movies are there where you actually wish it would continue its so good?). But you can do much worse than Two Towers and I recommend it for most intelligent movie-goers. It is a thrilling ride, no doubt about that. Let's just hope Jackson &amp; Co. work on regaining some of the dignified emotional magic from the Fellowship when they make Return Of The King.**** out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard some criticize this film in saying that those who have not read The Lord of the Rings can appreciate the film, and those who have read the books cannot. Well, I whole-heartedly disagree with this statement. The only ones who are not able to enjoy Peter Jackson's films are those who cannot separate themselves from a "book" and a "movie." People, you absolutely cannot interpret a book directly into film and make it work without taking some creative license. And to those who disagree, I say try it!I, as one who has read the books, as well as having seen both films thus far, love them equally and independently of each other. Jackson's The Two Towers took by breath away, it is truly an amazing cinematic spectacle and I didn't find it a bit dull at any time. Those of you who can stop comparing the books to the film long enough to appreciate it for what it is will thoroughly enjoy this movie. And those of you who can't, don't know what you're missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I think of Lord of the Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, I am a Die Hard Star Wars Fan. I never cared much for anything about LOTR or the hobbit until the movies came out. I went to watch the film only because I had nothing to do that day, only to be turned into one of the best fans of this story. Never read the books but I intend to now. Its unbelievable how stories like these are hidden like treasures waiting to be found. This is story that i would like to tell my children because it has the stuff heroes are made of. Not only because of the battle scenes, but because the characters are all from different backgrounds, races, gender and beliefs really do not care for one anther so as long as they leave each other alone. Kind of like our world. With the difference of a very few who realize the danger their world is in and decide to go against the odds, which is the attitude this world should have. The heroes of this story forget their backgrounds, beliefs, and differences for the search of a better life in which all live for the better. A story of honor, friendship unconditional love and just knowing that you should always try to do what you think is right. To be honest that is an interesting life the characters live in this epic. I am not one to really write or read a lot or even do what I'm doing right now but i must say this tale has changed my life. Well this is just to let you know all you LOTR fans you can count with a SW fan too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently went to see the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and I must say that it was the most amazing film ever to be released! I honestly am LOTR obsessed and saw the first one in theatres 7 times and bought it on DVD the day it came out...needless to say I have watched it countless times since then. Therefore I didn't think that a movie could get any better than the Fllowship of the Ring. I was sooooo excited to see the second one and was sure it would be as good as the first...buh never could I have guessed it would be the single most amazing piece of film I have ever come across! The characters, the music, the EVERYTHING was soooo amazing it's beyond words! Everyone should see this one...buh first see the first one if you are crazy enough to not have seen it already! People told me that I should bring something to sit on because it was awfully long and boring and my butt would fall asleep before or after I did...obviously not LOTR fans! Buh I was absolutely enthralled in the movie the 3 hours FLEW by! I can't wait to see it again! =D Definitely have to agree that it should be WAY up there on the Imdb top 250!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better - but not for the right reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Tolkien's trilogy is one of the most overrated works of literature ever produced. And no I'm not stupid, and yes, I can read long books (I love Moby-Dick, one of the best black humor stories ever written). I am, also, a fantasy fan. I don't think they're bad books because I can't appreciate fantasy or philosophy, but simply because they're poorly written and plotted. I made it 3/4 of the way through TFOTR before giving up. That said, I think Jackson's films are a VAST improvement over the books, and the second film much better than the first. Why? Because Jackson gives me pretty pictures and one very fine Viggo Mortensen to look at for three hours. Distracted by the pretty landscape and Aragorn's cheekbones, I can ignore the fact that character development is non-existent and emotional manipulation runs rampant. LOTR is really nothing more than a shallow action story with banal bits of philosophy floating through it. FOTR tries so hard to create character development and empathy, but fails miserably (I never understood why Arwen was so upset when she thought Frodo was dead, they had just met). All the music swelling, let's-have-a-deep-moment scenes were terrible. But TTT dispenses with most of this faux feeling and focuses instead on the action. This at least is entertaining and funny, unlike the endless walking in FOTR, interrupted by gravely somber discussions on how are we going to save the world. (Incidentally, there is some great character work in TTT, but it's found in Gollum, who has already been so praised here that I don't think I need say anymore on him. All the positive comments are true concerning him.) But there is no true friendship between Legolas and Gimli, no true love between Aragorn and Arwen, and the elves seem more like doped-up supermodels than mystical beings. The films carry no astounding message about the value of friendship or the struggle between good and evil (what, in life, is ever simply black and white?). When they try to be philopshical, they fail miserably. TTT has less "think-talk" than FOTR, which is very good. But the dialogue, oh god, the dialogue. It's terrible, not one single truly memorable line. This is straight from Tolkien and his own failure to write grippingly. "I think we have tarried here too long," Frodo says, before being captured by Faramir. Who, in real life, says crap like that? There's no tension, no laughter, no brilliance. It's Shakespearean language, but without Shakeseare's wit, double entendres, and dirty jokes. Bottom line, TTT is a great action flick for those who enjoy sword fights and gritty looking men (which I do - hey, we all have our shallow sides). But if you're looking for the best film of all time, look somewhere else. FOTR and TTT aren't even the best fantasy films ever made. That title, IMO, can be possessed only by Reiner's The Princess Bride. Memorable dialogue, wit, love, action, murder, revenge, The Princess Bride has it all - and clocks in at under three hours. Before you go see TTT for the gazillionth time, rent this delightful parody of fantasy and then tell me I'm wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie in many ways and a worthy follow-up to The Fellowship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(*minor spoilers*)Peter Jackson has done it again! He has given us a splendid movie, which is moving, funny spectacular, imaginative and epic in scale. He keeps you engrossed in the story for the whole 3 hours and leaves you wanting more when the end-credits roll by.Even though there are many similarities with the Fellowship when it comes to style, tone and general story elements, The Two Towers is also a very different movie-experience. And still Peter Jackson manages to reach the same quality standard set by its predecessor. Amazing!A great part of the movie is about the battle at Helm's Deep and it's preparations. Much has been said already about the greatness of the battle scenes. I have to agree with most critics. It's unparalleled! Spectacularly shot and executed. The whole build-up to the battle is tense, emotional, with great pieces of dialogue delivered by Theoden, Aragorn and Legolas.Another fairly large part shows Frodo's struggles with the ring, his emerging dark side, and the complications that the creature Gollum brings to the drama of his character. Of course it's also about the tragic figure of Gollum himself (a brilliantly created cgi-character), but it's especially interesting to see how Frodo and Gollum mirror each other. Sam is the stable figure in all this and has to make sure Frodo keeps his sanity. It's really wonderful to see the interaction between these three characters.Then there is a smaller part dedicated to Merry and Pippin's meeting with the Ents (walking and talking trees), and Treebeard in particular. Even though the Ents didn't completely match the image I had of them prior to seeing the movie (I had imagined them as being really huge, like all the other trees in the forest while in the movie they were quite a bit smaller), they were still a joy to watch, and once they were lined up, getting ready for battle, I was totally buying their appearance. The battle of the Ents was one of the standout moments of the movie, I must say. Seeing the vengeance of these ents, hurtling rocks, squashing orks, and flooding Isengard, is really terrific! Still, there are many more enchanting and spectacular moments in the movie. Gandalf's fight with the Balrog, a warg attack (beasts looking like huge hyena's), two trolls opening the black gate, olifaunts (huge elephant-like creatures), I could go on.The way Peter Jackson tells the separate stories works terrifically. The cutting between the different storylines is refreshing, makes for a good pace of the movie, and keeps you involved with every character. Halfway through, we even get a sequence in which we return to the Aragorn-Arwen love story (through a dream/flashback scene), and see appearances by Elrond and Galadriel. It doesn't distract from the rest. On the contrary: it is a nice and calm intermission in the midst of all the mayhem going on in Middle Earth.The overall tone of the movie is nicely balanced. Dramatic moments, action-sequences, dashes of humour, romance; Peter Jackson finds the time and place for all of these elements.The movie isn't flawless though. For example, Gimli is portrayed as a funny dwarf who is clumsy and often can't keep up with the rest. Even though the funny moments work many times and he is still tough and ruthless with his axe, his character is a little too much of a comic relief. It doesn't do justice to his character. (Hopefully, Jackson will compensate this in the Return of the King. Then I can forgive him.) Other moments go a little over the top or get a bit corny. Then there are some scenes, which are not menacing enough (for example the first appearance of the nazgul on the winged creature), or need to be a little more fleshed out.In the end though, in the light of the whole movie, the weak points turn out to be minor quibbles. The amazing experience that is 'The Two Towers' is definitely no letdown. It is a work of art and can proudly stand next to 'The Fellowship Of the Ring'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Series with Some Promise Crumbles Like a Tower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the fairly good "Fellowship of the Ring" falls apart at the seams, as most sequels do. While the irritating close-up of the supposedly powerful ring every ten minutes in the first film is removed, we get a character, more annoying than The Phantom Menace's Jar-Jar Binks, continuously saying "precious, precious" over and over and over again with a voice like someone scratching their fingernails down a blackboard. I wasn't intrigued by a single line of dialogue nor by any of the wooden characters. This is basically "The Mummy Returns" linked with what some consider to be classic literature, simply to give it credibility, and devoid of any interesting plot. Here's the plot: "Oh, look, there are some monsters. Let's go slaughter them. Ah, done. Oh, guess what! Some more monsters! Let's kill them. Oh, and you wouldn't believe it. More monsters...". Do yourself a favour and go for something with a bit more substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Awesome Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this movie is a fantastic, awesome adventure, I found myself wrapped up in it and wondering why it took so long to end. Well, they could have cut out some of the big war near the end which could have left an Intermission for 15-20 minutes to go to bathrooms, but since the studios don't do this anymore what can we do? This should really be taken into consideration by all of Hollywood with films over 2 1/2 hours long. The tale is quite complicated and one has to listen very carefully to understand the story of the Middle Earth, and it's creatures. The winning creature is the hobbit, a computer generated character who teases and cajoles and has a winning personality; one has to listen to him to really know what's going on. Sam and his buddy Mr Frodo are continually beset upon by this hobbit who is practically in the nude.The acting is superb, photography is beautifully done, and the music is grand! The editing is very good, too!It also helps for one to know a little bit about medieval history or witchcraft to understand this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Cinema Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The part two installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy provided an exceptional cinema experience. Two Towers shows boundless imagination, exceptional direction, and good old fashioned escape quality. The battle scenes are truly epic, the scenes in the Dead Marshes are chilling and freakish, and the beginning sequence of Frodo's dream and the Balrog battle all together demonstrates sheer genius and rare quality in film making. The CGI creation of Gollum is a marvellous achievement in technology and raises the level and standard of film to new heights. The vast complicated scope of Tolkien's imagination has seen a remarkable transfer to the cinema, and the scope of the filmmaker's imagination is unlimited. Those viewers who didn't see the first film may become lost in the increasingly complicated story, but they won't be disappointed in the cinema basics. Never the less, rarely would a film maker dwell so richly on certain moments such as the King of Rohan's pathos. Indeed a lot of character development takes place in this second part of the trilogy, and this justifies the focus of the first part. We see the characters of Merry and Pippin take on new depth, and Frodo's turmoil allows actor Elijah Wood to turn in a fine performance as the loveable and innocent Hobbit turns into a tortured soul. Thus, anticipation is built to continue the journey with these now even more interesting characters. The pursuit of this project has greatly enriched film making. All kudos is due to the director, technicians and actors. This film earns a rare 10/10 from me; for this to me is what film making and what going to the cinema are all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a full on final hour! This was real edge-of-your seat stuff and to be honest I will have to go again to take it all in.This was great action cinema. I found the contrast in pace of the three threads of the story quite good in terms of keeping your interest, otherwise the tone of the film would have been too frantic.***spoilers***Good bits.Gollum - what a great job was done on Smeagol! There will be no best supporting actor nomination, but it should be acknowledged as a major step forward in use of technology while maintaining the emotional quality of the acting. The nasty, pathetic, tragic nature of this character was perfectly shown and the split personality dialogue was brilliant.Action - none better. Was a bit much for my wife but I loved it.Comedy - needed to break up the mood. Gimli lights up a small part of the gloom (second movies in trilogies seem to always be the darkest).Bad bits.Not many and frankly I feel that it's a bit picky, but I thought the nobility and tragedy involved in the Ents was not brought out as well as it might have been.Different bits.There has been enough said about the movie vs book changes so far so I'll keep it brief.There was enough battle without the wargs, which were merely an excuse for Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving to get screen time via a dream sequence. I can see the need, but it was a distraction.Elves at Helm's Deep. Basically this appears to have occurred to try and balance that fact that the elves had been painted as letting the poor humans do all the work to this point. Fair enough. Also, we needed a character to kill off, as Tolkien didn't really see the need for anyone to die in most of his trilogy, which is a bit silly in what is basically pages and pages of fight and flight. Fair enough again.Can't wait for number three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Disappointed to no end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, you could classify me as 'one of those Tolkien losers', but my opinion is just as valid as anyone elses'. I tried hard to blame my disappointment with this movie on me being disoriented when I saw it, or in a drunken- or stoned-like state somehow, but I have come to the conclusion that this movie really blew, especially if you have any clue what you're talking about. People, who I can only assume are too lazy to read the books, call this 'a great masterpiece of our time' and 'an instant classic', but I must negate that resolution. True, it is a subjective opinion, and true, it is an adaptation of the book, but honestly... that doesn't explain away anything in this, and people that say that 'it's jsut nerds who pay attention to that stuff' are probably insecure, and have a baseless argument. Read StumbleBee's comment on the movie to see my main issues with it, I really don't feel like repeating what's been said before. I will say what I liked about the movie, however. 1.Gollum was so-so. Much better than the Jar Jar v2.0 I dreaded when going into the movie, but not an incredible job done here. 2. Theoden and Faramir. Well cast, badly portrayed. Not the actor's fault. 3. There were parts of the movie where it felt they had strayed back on track. Some of the scenes in Itilien, before Frodo and Sam get captured, come to mind; i.e. the stuff about whether they were going to be in any songs or anything. I thought that to be very much in the spirit of the books. Patches of actual Tolkien a movie does not make. It isn't that Jackson made changesto the book, but the changes he made are what sadden me. He COULD have skipped adding in the Warg attack, Aragorn's adventure, the debate between Arwen and Elrond (though this wasn't really awful), and the trip to Osgiliath in favor of more Ent time, Entmoot, etc. Also the breaking of Saruman's staff, Shelob battle, and Frodo's capture were glossed over. Jackson's only screwing himself in ROTK... Dunno where to rate this. Maybe a 5/10, just can't trust Jackson anymore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, So-So Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a giant fan of the LOTR books, The Hobbit, and especially The Silmarillon. This movie is good, but as an adaptation it isn't nearly as good as The Fellowship SE was. I was disappointed in the adaptation, but happy with the movie itself. If you've never seen The Fellowship, you'd be lost. It picks up literally right after The Fellowship ends. And those who've complained that they can't remember how The Fellowship ened, GO OUT AND RENT IT!!! It's been out since AUGUST!!! NO COMPLAINTS ARE VALID ABOUT THAT!!!Now onto the film itself...(some spoilers involved)CG Graphics- At spots it's really fake. Even with the "great" Gollum. Some parts are so bad that it reminds me of Ep. 1 Jar-Jar. The Deeping Wall scene with the Uruk-Hai was incredibly fake looking at times. Almost looked better in the "Two Towers" video game. Plot- Drifted a bit too much from the book. In the book, there was no fake Aragorn death, nor a flashback with Arwen and Elrond. (Though that scene was well-done). The parts with the Ents were weak, not just adaptation wise either. The Faramir scenes were a bit forced and not wholly believable. Just a good summer-movie plotline by comparison to the previous film.Dialogue/Acting- Gimli's turn as a comedian blows chunks. Some lines are good, but he's a hardened warrior in the previous film. Can't they keep up some continuity? Theoden is well acted but not well scripted, Eomer is lacking in the script department too. Grima and Gollum were excellently acted and scripted. Stuff That Caught Me- The last scene with the Ents overthrowing Isengard was wonderful. The death of Haldir was not necessary, and it made me a bit sad because Haldir's been around for a damn long time in The Silmarillon. The Wargs were interesting till Aragorn's fake death. The Nazgul and their winged steeds were friggin awesome. All in all, a fairly good film. Not up to par of The Fellowship, but good.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that Peter Jackson and company did not follow the novel word for word. I am sick of reading comments by so many naysayers that are nitpicking lines, scenes or the characters over the smallest details ("Hey! Merry never said that in the book!).I challenge ANY of them to go to Hollywood, convince a company to front them $300 million dollars and do a better job - while raking in the cash and acclaim that this film is doing. People who couldn't direct traffic, let alone three MAJOR pictures, have no business commenting on the movies.That aside, this was simply an amazing movie. True, PJ was pretty liberal with the novel - but he has to be to compress 600+ pages into a three hour movie that a non-fanatic could understand. Did I like all the changes? Nope. But its still a damn fine movie.The good stuff:1. The battles. Simply incredible. The battle for Helm's Deep is one of the finest battle sequences ever. It truly captures the chaos, horror, and claustraphobic feel of hand to hand combat. I felt like I was on the wall at Helms Deep surrounded and outnumbered. I felt like I should be there defending the Rohirrim people.2. The actors. Outstanding casting - everyone fits their role. Usually, you have at least one person who just doesn't fit their part. Not here. Bernhard Hill (Theoden) should be a nominee for best supporting actor. He more than holds his own against the major characters. Another plus - John Rhys Davies. There was too little of Gimli the dwarf in FOTR. Not here. Gimli steals the show with a mix of humor, action and compassion throughout the film.3. The score. Howard Shore's Gaelic inspired music enhance the emotion in every scene. I was nearly in tears during Theodred's burial (and another nod to Bernhard hill for his acting here). A lowpoint - the end credits song - what the hell was that?In conclusion, this is a film worth seeing. Its another highpoint for American cinema. See this one at the theater, it just won't be the same on a TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who are we to judge how the book didn't come out the same on the screen? Books traverse time and space differently than how a motion picture does. Peter Jackson and all of his writers deserve kudos for what they have accomplished. It truly is a cinematic experience that one should see just for the experience. Not to whine and p**s and moan about how different it really is from the book, that might I remind all of you was written about 60 some odd years ago. I for one started of saying, "That's not how it is in the book. Blah, blah, blah...." And as I caught myself doing it I realized that when I got the FOTR on DVD I watched through the commentary for the extended version and paid attention to what was being said about the differences from print to movie screen and how each point in the film was shot a specific way for the whole of the story to remain intact. Time does pass much differently on screen than in the book and certain parts of the story have to be re-written to achieve their point. It's simply AMAZING that Peter Jackson had the BALLS to go out and film all three back to back to back and make this story come alive for all of us to enjoy. He has done what no one thought possible and I read how people are bashing his efforts because he left out 5+ chapters and Liv Tyler was in there when she wasn't supposed to be. Does anyone realize that for the giant battle scene in the Two Towers he spent over 4 months filming in the rain at night? Entire movies have been made in four months, but this was just one part of one movie for him. Shame on us. Shame on you and certainly, shame on me.</fullReview>

Now ive never read any of the books, but i saw the animated LOTR film, so i knew most of what happened.TTT isn't very friendly to those that never saw/read FotR, as it jumps strait into the screens that have the now broken fellowship. Frodo &amp; sam are continuing to mount doom, Aragon, Glimi, and leglos are running after the orcs that captured merry &amp; pipin. From here we meet arguably the best character of the film, Golum, a possesed king, a girl who can hold a sword. And you may have heard a bit about a battle, Helms deep, which has to be one of the best fights ever. And as FotR had cool fights, Helms Deep easily beats any of these in terms of scale and graphics.So forget what you heard and part with your money, its too good to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the books, three times each, thrice and thrice, the Power of Three, but I write not as a Tolkien scholar, nor as your middle of the bee-curve, "what's a book?" movie-goer. Nor even as an educated critic.I write now as a confirmed escapist, one who - not so much would rather be there, but would rather be anywhere but here. One who is reasonably certain that they were born in the wrong world, and if only they could concentrate hard enough, surely it should be possible to launch fire from their fingertips? Someone who was always puzzled when the other kids failed to understand his witty one-liners, or realize that his peculiar expression was not a facial tick, but rather the hidden depths of inner-torment and a rage, a rage barely concealed and fit to burn the world, sort of thing.So when I say this movie was fantastic, I am being context inclusive. True, no-one in *our* world would go prancing about in the wilderness, shouting defiant taunts and challenges where no-one but the wind could hear them... almost as if, despite the isolation, every moment of their lives were being captured on film. Because, in Middle Earth, every man, elf, dwarf, hobbit and tree is a hero, and such is how heroes behave.We can forgive the constant aerial shots too because, in Middle Earth, they are aware of the stunning, breath-taking beauty and mystery of their land, they are never removed from it, and in their heads, their own heads, this is how they see their lives, a sort of panoptic hallucaegenia where every step rebounds in their imagination as it might be seen from the air by a drunk bird with an eye for action. Wizards are mysterious, orcs are foul, King's are brooding, swords are sharp and elves are consummate acrobats. It was all enough to bring a tear to an old geek's eye.My only complaint is that the movie was very short. Only three hours long. A good book can last me a couple of days.I'll give it an 8/10, because I'm a writer myself, and I would have done it differently. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw LOTR The Two Towers last night and I was very happy with it except for one thing: Faramir. I pretty much agree with the last couple of postings about this flick and I know that an exact reproduction of the book in movie form would be impossible as well as boring. I know that the movie will never be what the book was. I know that people will have a hard time remembering who characters are so some are eliminated while others expand to fill the gaps (like the way the reduced 6 rocket boys to 4 in the movie October sky). But the change in Farmir's character from a man who is almost Aragorn like in his duty and understanding of the dangers of the ring to a man who is a carbon copy of Boromir baffled me. Everything else was good to great. Gollum was fantastic, the addition of the elves to the battle of helms deep was ok, the dwarve jokes were cute. The Ents were suprisingly effective (I was worried about them looking dumb in the movie). I give it an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on all of us.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who are we to judge how the book didn't come out the same on the screen? Books traverse time and space differently than how a motion picture does. Peter Jackson and all of his writers deserve kudos for what they have accomplished. It truly is a cinematic experience that one should see just for the experience. Not to whine and p**s and moan about how different it really is from the book, that might I remind all of you was written about 60 some odd years ago. I for one started of saying, "That's not how it is in the book. Blah, blah, blah...." And as I caught myself doing it I realized that when I got the FOTR on DVD I watched through the commentary for the extended version and paid attention to what was being said about the differences from print to movie screen and how each point in the film was shot a specific way for the whole of the story to remain intact. Time does pass much differently on screen than in the book and certain parts of the story have to be re-written to achieve their point. It's simply AMAZING that Peter Jackson had the BALLS to go out and film all three back to back to back and make this story come alive for all of us to enjoy. He has done what no one thought possible and I read how people are bashing his efforts because he left out 5+ chapters and Liv Tyler was in there when she wasn't supposed to be. Does anyone realize that for the giant battle scene in the Two Towers he spent over 4 months filming in the rain at night? Entire movies have been made in four months, but this was just one part of one movie for him. Shame on us. Shame on you and certainly, shame on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt wonderfully made. The special effects are mind-blowing. It is not just the effects that make this movie though. It's the wonderful acting and the love for J.R.R.Tolkien's books.Gollum, the animated creature from Andy Serkis is brilliant. I almost felt that there really is a Gollum wandering around! I have nothing to complain about; all the actors are perfectly cast, and the film is being pretty loyal to the books as well.I am going crazy waiting for Return of the King to hit theaters next December. I can't wait it see it!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, I have to tell you that I've never read any of the books in the LOTR series. I really think this would have helped me enjoy the movie. There were several awkward moments-I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, or just leave the theater. I was a little frightened to see a big tree carry little humans with hairy feet(hobbits) for the entirety of the three hour plus movie. He just told them stories and walked around.... This is probably a very common problem for adapted screenplays but it seems this could've been handled a little better so that everyone could enjoy and understand it. I love the emotions expressed in this movie- being attacked by an army of 10,000, seeing a tall man step out of a white cloud and start talking to you, traveling with an ugly creature with a striking resemblance to Dobby of Harry Potter. Please see the movie whether you've read the books or not....just expect the unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, firstly yes, WE KNOW that a few chapters are missing from the film, and yes a *few* parts are made up, but FotR missed a few chapters (or so i'm told). Now ive never read any of the books, but i saw the animated LOTR film, so i knew most of what happened.TTT isn't very friendly to those that never saw/read FotR, as it jumps strait into the screens that have the now broken fellowship. Frodo &amp; sam are continuing to mount doom, Aragon, Glimi, and leglos are running after the orcs that captured merry &amp; pipin. From here we meet arguably the best character of the film, Golum, a possesed king, a girl who can hold a sword. And you may have heard a bit about a battle, Helms deep, which has to be one of the best fights ever. And as FotR had cool fights, Helms Deep easily beats any of these in terms of scale and graphics.So forget what you heard and part with your money, its too good to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rollercoaster ride of excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally here comes a movie that is worth the price of admission and more, a movie that surpasses your wildest expectations and constantly fills your eyes with wonder, a movie that grabs you from the first frame, carries you off to another time and place, immerses you in an epic struggle of good versus evil and makes you give a darn about the outcome, a movie with characters who are real and are given poetry for dialog in place of profanity, a movie where we care about those characters, where we root for our heroes and curse their enemies. Finally here comes a movie that deserves the title "epic." Here comes Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Kneel down and pray.I should say I am not a huge fan of Tolkien (though I enjoyed reading The Hobbit as a boy). I saw the first film and thought it was "okay," but this one -- this one made me a believer. The movie simply does not mess around. For one thing, you need not be a LOTR-geek to get caught up in the spectacle of the thing -- probably the best that modern special effects has to offer the movie-going public. A surreal, dream-like world is established, half-cartoon, half-flesh-and-blood; which is which is often hard to tell. Like any good magic show, at some point you just give in and enjoy the show.The Two Towers astounds its audience with sweeping vistas, gargantuan armies, looming castle walls, dark forests, giant monsters, dragons, and all manner of fantastical creatures. And its real. I particularly enjoyed the way mythological creatures became real creatures before my eyes. We become familiar with the nature and limitations of dwarves and wizards, elves and orcs, and oh yes...hobbits. For example, when Gandalf the Grey throws off his robe, revealing that he has acquired new power and become Gandalf the "White," you feel like you are witnessing a real wizard. All of the creatures move and operate according to certain rules -- just like in any universe. But its not hokey, the way, say, an episode of Charmed might be with its "White Lighters" and "Demons." Here is a world where a master dwarf is, well, a master dwarf -- a creature with excellent fighting abilities, sure, but don't count on him to give chase to bad guys (since he can't run very fast or for very long). Nor can you expect him to be able to leap from a tiny ledge on the side of a castle, some ten feet across in order to attack a battalion of Uruk-Hai warriors gathered on the narrow entrance leading into the castle. He must be thrown across the way if he is to make it at all. Hey come on; after all, he's a dwarf!The acting is so good that the characters are not being portrayed -- they simply are. The plot, though complex, never leaves us wondering. In fact, the plot is really quite simple: War is brewing. An evil force is gathering. Innocent lives are threatened. A final battle is promised and when it finally occurs, we are in awe. Ladders are slowly raised to storm castle walls, swarms of arrows impale snarling soldiers, and all of it looks magnificent. As cliché as it sounds, the movie is a rollercoaster ride of excitement. Get in line and buy your ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was unbelievable! In some way, it might be better then the first. It's like 'The Godfather Pt.2', it was a phenominal movie, but in order to fully understand it and appreciate it, you have to see the first one. At the moment, I'm reading 'The Two Towers' and though some parts have been altered, Peter Jackson has so far done an incredible job living up to the book's expectations. The movie has amazing cinematograpy, costumes, setting, makeup, characters, and a beautiful score. This movie was nominated for a couple of Golden Globes, and though it is up against some fierce competition, I hope it will pull through. I know for a fact though that it will be nominated for several Oscars. 'The Two Towers' all the way!!</fullReview>

I enjoyed it as much as the Fellowship of the Ring, and though it did stray for the plot of the book in some areas (I'll let those curious of that to read other comments) I still feel that all in all the main story gets told.You must understand that the middle 2 books (Yes, I am calling the "trilogy" 6 books, as it was written) are mostly of 2 battles (Helm's Deep and Isengard) and Frodo and Sam and their dealings with Gollum.While this does make for great action and adventure on the part of Aragorn &amp; Company, it really wasnt much to go on in terms of resolution, something most people need in a movie, even if you know the story. I do think they could have lessened the love story a little, but I can understand why he put it in, so that the love is more developed and those who havent ever read Tolkien can appreciate the love of Arwen and Aragorn.I thought that Gollum's part was done beautifully, and the story between himself and between Frodo and Sam interesting and complex. To make Frodo more interesting (From here on out he becomes more or less a zombie), they included the scene with the Nazgul, which I felt could also have been done without, but once again, I can understand why it was put in.As for the last 5 chapters, I have heard rumors that he is saving that (Shelbob and the like) for the final movie, also probably to help the storyline of Frodo and Sam to be more interesting and involved rather than them just trudgeing along every time they appear in the next film.You must understand that while Peter Jackson did stray from the story-line, it was done with good intentions and in will make for a more interesting movie in the end. You must balance those who love the series and those who dont even know that it was a book before these movies first came out. In the end, the merging of the two has created a magnificent blend of story-telling that has stayed more true to its origins than almost ALL other story based movies.</fullReview>

This movie works, and it shows in the excellent reviews it has received and in it's box office so far. The only people i've heard complaint about it are the purist, who just can't get the fact that the book can't be made successfully into a movie without making some changes. If you didn't like the movie, that's ok, but don't let others think that it's a bad movie. I've read the books, and once you see them as separate entities, you'll enjoy them both for what they are. The books, the greatest story of the 20th century. The movies, so far the best movies in the 21st. Can't wait for Return of the King!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great expectations are not going to be disappointed ( if you haven't read the book)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the `Two Towers' I felt both, fascinated and a little disappointed. On the one hand I was captivated by the scenery, New Zealand is definitely the perfect setting for the Lord of the Rings. Then, of course, the special effects were impressive, especially when the masses of Orcs go marching to Helms Deep to destroy mankind and they seem to fill the whole valley like a dark cloud that is thundering across the sky, covering everything with darkness that's in its way. Also the creature Gollum is just brilliant, because the expressions on its face and his movements are so realistic. It must be a computer animation, though it doesn't look it at all! Another thing I admire is that most of the actors are unknown. Except for Liv Tyler who I personally don't like at all, and Cate Blanchett who is just perfect for Galadriel the Elvenqueen. But apart from them, I don't know the others which is important, because you tend to identify them with the former films they did and it would be irritating to imagine lets say, Bruce Willis as a hero of Middle Earth, fighting against Orcs with a sword when you last saw him, shooting gangsters with a machine gun!The reason why I'm disappointed is, because the story was changed a little! I really don't care if some parts of the book are left out, because the plot would be far too complicated for a film. But, and they really got me angry with that, there is no point in changing the story! In the first film `The Fellowship of the Ring', Boromir was totally obsessed by the ring and the desire to have power that he even tried to kill Frodo, the ring bearer. In the `Two Towers', Frodo is confronted with Faramir, Boromir's brother who according to the book is not at all hasty in making decisions nor is he drawn to the desire of having power. He lets the Hobbits go by his own will. However, in the film he is just like Boromir not a bit better than him, so he takes the Hobbits with him to Osgiliath were a Nazg?l , a dark rider who has the only desire to get the one ring, is looking for them. The most idiotic scene is the following: Frodo is standing alone facing the Nazg?l riding on a huge flying beast. Then Faramir comes along, hurting the beast with a single arrow and its flying away, just like that! I mean, apart from that modification the film is so excellent! No one would ever believe that a Nazg?l that would rather face destruction than leaving the ring behind, would do so, just because its means of transport is hurt, when the ring is just a stone throw away! Never!Anyway, I enjoyed the film a lot, for the reason that most of the characters, like Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas and Treebeard are just as I imagined them to be! I'm so curious about how they'll do the last part. It's a pain to know it will take one more year to find out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after seeing the first film, which far exceeded my expectations in terms of how closely it followed the book, I was not expecting the second film to be a blundering failure.... And thank god it wasn't!!! This film has made me think that Hollywood has taken a different philosophy out on 'safe' moviemaking ie: "nothing too complex for the masses please" (which the likes of George Lucas &amp; Chris Columbus preach to) and even some critics may have said "it is simply too fragmented and complex to be followed like The Fellowship wasn't", but hey just because you're a bit slow and rather dumb Mr Critic, please don't think that we are. It was the best job I have seen of a director piecing together what is essentially four different stories and making them ALL feel like one... It's big, it's clever and it is TOLKIEN to the letter! This film will live on eternally as a classic for shattering Hollywood preconceptions about what can make money in cinema... LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Compelling than the Fellowship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the director's cut of the Fellowship of the Ring, I have a much deeper appreciation for this film and lament many of the scenes that were "lost" to meet time constraints.Having said that, I want to express to any readers of this commentary that the recently released version of The Two Towers is a much more compelling film. It is poignant and more fleshed out on many important "human" levels than was its predecessor, even without the advantage of added character development lost in TFOTR.While I thoroughly enjoyed TFOTR, at times it suffered from pacing problems brought on by necessary exposition, a lack of energy or glee in Elfkind that was so evident in Tolkien's masterpiece, and even some scenes added to purely show off special effects. The Two Towers has a pace and scope that doesn't allow for any of these worries.Elves are leaving (not a lot of room for glee), Hobbits are lost (get used to it) and Humans are on the brink (sound familiar?). The action here is tighter and made more meaningful by a truly compelling plot. A king must rise to the occasion for his people, or all may be lost! The scenes we are given in the Rohan capital of Ederas are akin to good Shakespeare.If I convey only one thing about what I think makes these films truly great, it has to be the impeccable casting. Peter Jackson has shown us that he has the soul of a Hobbit and the eye of an artist, but the decisions on casting are truly awe-inspiring.Now off to see it for the fourth time....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In one word: Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought it couldn't get any better than Fellowship.This movie is classic. See it now. Even if you hated the first in every aspect, see it just for the special effects and the wonderous cinematography.This movie is not only exciting, it also has great acting to boot. I admire the picks for the cast: they avoided picking superstars and picked mostly nobodies who were good for the part.Some new additions:Eowyn: Perfect. Even though Miranda Otto is a little old for the part, she plays the "I wanna fight but I can't because I'm a girl/lovesick puppy" part very well, and she looks damn good as well. Bravo.Theoden: He did great. Especially when he was possessed by Saruman: he looked and sounded like he was around one hundred and twenty. And this guy knows how to cry convincingly.Eomer: Even though he has little screen time, he does very well with what little he has.Grima Wormtounge: Brad Dourif, why haven't you acted in other movies lately? He does wonderful in the badguy role and blew me away. He was perfect as Wormtounge and I couldn't see anyone else in the role. Hopefully this role will put him out of anonymity in movies.Gollum: He deserves Best Supporting Actor. His role is truely heartwrenching. Not only did Andy Serkis study the books and work at how to do the voice with no vocal accompaniant, he also moved like the character did in the books and some of his facial expressions were inhuman, they were done so well. And he has a few CGI pixels covering him: big freaking whoop. All of his movements and expressions are there, just implanted into a CGI creature. Of course our pansy Academy probably won't nominate him, because everyone thinks he's purely CGI. Nonsense. If anything, he's about one third CGI.Faramir: Even though his character is completely different from the book, he's still played very well and I think his character is more believable than the one in the book.This movie took two viewings to sink in: the large changes to the book distracted me in the first viewing, but as I grew to accept them, I decided to watch this for what it was: a movie, not an adaptation of Tolkien's book.A solid 10 out of 10 from me. And I'm sure the Extended will be an improvement, as it was with Fellowship.It'll feel like a century until Return of the King...which I'm sure will be even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but a worse adaptation then FOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a very avid fan of the books, I felt that a few too many liberties were taken with the plot of the Two Towers in it's adaption to the screen. The two major changes from the book which (in my opinion) would have been better cinematicly if they had NOT been changed were Faramir taking Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath and the downplaying of the Legolas and Gimli commraderie. Faramir lost some of his wisdom, Gimli some of his dignity and Legolas seemed to gain some super powers. Regardless, this isn't the book and had more than enough enjoyable parts to make up for what I perceived as discrepancies. Really enjoyable and almost as good as Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie was one of the best ones out right now. I enjoyed it as much as the Fellowship of the Ring, and though it did stray for the plot of the book in some areas (I'll let those curious of that to read other comments) I still feel that all in all the main story gets told.You must understand that the middle 2 books (Yes, I am calling the "trilogy" 6 books, as it was written) are mostly of 2 battles (Helm's Deep and Isengard) and Frodo and Sam and their dealings with Gollum.While this does make for great action and adventure on the part of Aragorn &amp; Company, it really wasnt much to go on in terms of resolution, something most people need in a movie, even if you know the story. I do think they could have lessened the love story a little, but I can understand why he put it in, so that the love is more developed and those who havent ever read Tolkien can appreciate the love of Arwen and Aragorn.I thought that Gollum's part was done beautifully, and the story between himself and between Frodo and Sam interesting and complex. To make Frodo more interesting (From here on out he becomes more or less a zombie), they included the scene with the Nazgul, which I felt could also have been done without, but once again, I can understand why it was put in.As for the last 5 chapters, I have heard rumors that he is saving that (Shelbob and the like) for the final movie, also probably to help the storyline of Frodo and Sam to be more interesting and involved rather than them just trudgeing along every time they appear in the next film.You must understand that while Peter Jackson did stray from the story-line, it was done with good intentions and in will make for a more interesting movie in the end. You must balance those who love the series and those who dont even know that it was a book before these movies first came out. In the end, the merging of the two has created a magnificent blend of story-telling that has stayed more true to its origins than almost ALL other story based movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. So many people are saying that they left out a lot of stuff and added a lot of sappy lovey dovey stuff between Aragorn and Arwen. SO WHAT? They had to have that in there to explain Aragorn and Arwens love for each other. And about leaving Shelob out. It gives you something to anticipate now. So for all you people complaining about how he didn't stick to the books. WAIT FOR THE SPECIAL EDITION DVD. All the cut scenes will be there and you will get all the precious missing material you so love to complain about. I thought the movie was excellent. Gollum looked realistic (even though he did travel during day and he hates the sun) Treebeard was excellent. Sure Saruman wasn't in as much as I would like but whatever. And you shouldn't complain about this. You could never have all the stuff from the books in there. If they did the movies would each be about 5 hours long. And you need the love scenes and everything to explain to the people who haven't read Lord of the Rings what happens.</fullReview>

This movie works, and it shows in the excellent reviews it has received and in it's box office so far. The only people i've heard complaint about it are the purist, who just can't get the fact that the book can't be made successfully into a movie without making some changes. If you didn't like the movie, that's ok, but don't let others think that it's a bad movie. I've read the books, and once you see them as separate entities, you'll enjoy them both for what they are. The books, the greatest story of the 20th century. The movies, so far the best movies in the 21st. Can't wait for Return of the King!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant for such a tough movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People thought that making a movie of The Lord Of The Rings would be an impossible task with its variety of environment and complex characters but Peter Jackson made it look easy. He combined action with depth and an unbeatable cast to pull such a thing off. In my opinion this will be considered a great for decades.If you know anything about writing you should know that a screenplay is very different from a book. Turning a book into a movie is no easy task. I admit that Jackson added a few things and left some things out but he had to. He had a flow and had to stick with it. He focused more on Helms Deep than the other scenes but that is what he had to do.I you have not seen the movie and are reading this let me tell you this: you will have a wide smile on your face the whole three hours. I know that I did. It is one of those movies where you feel like you are with them and you want to jump into the screen and help them. It is an enjoyment very hard to find, especially in a movie.If you read the book right before you go, don't look for things that really happened and things that are made up, but just watch the movie. On top of its correctness to the book, it is also a 5 star movie. One of my favorites at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge and jolting dissapointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of both the original Tolkien LOTR trilogy and the first film, the fellowship of the ring. Both possesed a certain intimacy and overall sense of strength due to the way in which they were original and engaging. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the Two Towers. TTT was a total and complete mess from top to bottom, a downward spiral of pathetic Hollywood money making schemes and an overall heap of cliche garbage.Characters are as deep as a puddle at this point, and the sole desire of the movie seemed to be geared towards "awe inspiring" battle scenes,"scary" orcs and the sappy, melodramatic "bravery" of the heroes. Well, awe inspiring they were not. Predictable and bland is more like it. Gollum was the only shining light in this film, otherwise it was just a total piece of trash. It hurts me to say that, because I enjoyed the first film so much and the books are just absolutely phenomenal. I think P. Jackson must have polled a group of 11 year old boys on the way out of the Fellowship of the Ring last year and decided the go on their advice. They probably said stuff like "The dwarf gimli was so funny! heehee!", "the battle scenes were really awesome - wow!!!", "the Uruk Hai leader was scary! - eeek!!!" etc etc etc. After tabulating this information, it seems like he based the movie around these weak sets of standards and made it a long boring waste of time and money.Many crazed and obsessed fans of this film have been defeated by the hype. I think they have been convincing themselves for the last year that since the first one was good, this one will be even better. When they were presented with this melodramatic b.s., somehow I feel like many of them just accepted it because they didnt want to be let down. Thats a real shame. I say embrace the dissapointing feeling and just be honest, rather than trying to convince yourself that it was the incredible triumph you think it was. Hey - if you liked it, you liked it. Im not going to argue with that. It just seems really pitiful when someone claims they dont like TTT and get ripped apart for speaking their opinion. Thats just depressing. I think many fans are unfortunately starting to equate the books with these movies, and claming that a true fan of the books MUST love TTT or else theyre not a real fan. Thats just sad, I think. will probably bring up the boneheaded argument "well why did you post this much if you hated it so much!?!?!". Im posting this in hope that maybe somehow, someway, anyone else out there who loved the books and was dissapointed with this movie can honestly feel like they arent the only one who is honest with themselves. A film series of this magnitude also deserves an even headed approach rather than just a bunch of blind Peter Jackson worshippers saying that it is the greatest movie of all time.I would like to see a more charecter based and mature approach to the last film so that it can at least be seen as some sort of overall effort rather than just a good start and nothing more. This needs to improve, its gotten very weak.Can you honestly claim that this film deserves a 9.0?????????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Gets Even Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can anyone say about this installment of LOTR? It just gets better and better.For those who have complained about this movie being too long, too confusing, having too much violence, having too much added or taken away from the books, etc: How can I politely say this? Well, here it is -- Quit whining! This is as good as it gets.It should be understood that the task of capturing a story as huge as LOTR on film is probably the most ambitious cinema project ever attempted, and Peter Jackson has succeeded in a HUGE way. The Two Towers is epic, grand, awe-inspiring, colossal, and did I say epic?Ok, all hype aside, the only one thing that can justifiably be said to criticize this film really can't be helped. As a stand-alone movie, it can be darned confusing. Anyone who hasn't seen Fellowship Of The Ring will be hopelessly lost and confused. Those who haven't read the books might have a hard time following the fine points of the story. But even people who fit into those categories will be treated to lots of eye candy and spectacular cinemaphotography.TTT is in the unfortunate position of effectively being the middle three hours of a nine hour movie. Just like the middle child of a family, it has to struggle a bit to get the attention that its siblings do. Fellowship was groundbreaking and emotional; Return of the King will likely be spectacular in bringing the story to closure; but TTT has the difficult job of connecting those portions together while still holding the attention of the average movie goer.Those of us who are familiar with the books know what is coming next, and how the events of TTT are crucial to setting it all up; while those who don't know the books might well wonder what the point of this movie is.With that rather long preamble, let me say that this movie has it all: drama, humor, action, emotion, spectacular sets and costumes, great acting, special effects that blow you away yet don't call attention to themselves. Gollum is nothing short of amazing. He is exactly as he is depicted in the books. His voice sends shivers down your spine and you actually feel sorry for him as he is still tortured by the ring. The ents are superb. The riders of Rohan and the city of Edoras are just as I imagined them to be. The battle of Helm's deep is some of the most incredible battle footage I've had the pleasure to watch in any movie of any genre. Etc, etc.Ok, now for the nitpicking. (Spoiler country ahead!) There were some significant modifications to the story. In the books, the ents didn't have to be tricked into destroying Isengard. Faramir wasn't really a clone of his older brother in trying to seize the ring for Gondor. Elves didn't really show up at the last minute to defend Helm's Deep. The movie left out the role of the Huorns (trees with an attitude) in defeating the orcs after the battle. Aragorn never took a fall over a cliff only to miraculously return. Shelob was left out entirely. (Although I fully expect that part to be included in the next and final chapter, since Gollum clearly set it up with his talk of "She'll kill them..")I can't say if the modifications made the movie better or worse; I'll just trust Peter Jackson and company's judgment that the changes were necessary in order to adapt a long and detailed written story to a manageable visual one. If every single detail of the books was turned into film, the title might very well need to be changed to "Bored of the Ring." For a purist, the changes might be blasphemy. But in reality, the changes added to the suspense and flow of the movie.No question about it, this one earns a solid 10/10 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was personally a disappointment. It didn't cover about half of the book, creating a challenge for Peter Jackson in The Return of the King. It seems improbable that he will be able to cover the third book completely as well as half of the second one in 3 hours.That aside, it wasn't as good of a movie as The Fellowship was. It lacked clarity for many that had not read the books, and Jackson spent too long on the battle of Helm's Deep. The movie lacked plot(because of the long battle)and included too many unnecessarily gory images. It was still entertaining, but greatly disappointing to those that love the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's not bad but it's not the best either. I was expecting much more than I got. Perhaps the reason is that LOTR 1 was absolutely brilliant and set high expectations. Perhaps another reason is the fact that I am a hardcore fan and have read the book innumerable times.Still, I accepted some changes in the LOTR 1. In The Two Towers, however, there are things that I cannot understand and/or accept.Mind you, I am not saying the movie is bad! It's just that I've spent an year in expecting to see something equally brilliant and exciting as the Fellowship.Now I will not be the one to start the endless discussion about the director's ideas and all this blah-blah. I just want to say that certain changes of the original plot do not contribute whatsoever to a better movie.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW The kiss and hug part is all right - people who have not read the book have to understand the drama of Aragorn and Arwen. But, for god's sake, why changing some crucial details in the battle of Helm's Deep?! The elves' arrival and the speech of their leader was a horrible cliche. Not to mention Frodo and Sam's trip to Osgilliath - now that was really too much. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe ents were quite meager - I am sure that PJ would have cut them out the way he cut out Tom Bombadil in LOTR 1 if he could. The outcome of the entmoot and the following speech was yet another horrible cliche. As a result, at certain points, I was outright bored and/or was shaking my head in complete confusion and bewilderment. (I've never thought that I will be bored during this movie.)Now some good words. Gollum was really brilliant - too sad he is a computer graphic, not a human. He deserves an Oscar for his part.The effects in general were Ok, though, during the battle for Helm's Deep the orcs were flying aside like toothpicks. The crossing of the Dead Marshes was creepy enough to scare me out of my wit.The Two Towers time and time again reminded me that New Zealand has a very pretty nature and made me wish to go there.Once again, the film is not bad at all, but could have been better. No matter what I will go and see it again any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading a book entitled "The Making of The Lord of the Rings" which details the processes involved in completing the three movies of such epic scale. Seriously, just one of these films would be the pinnacle for many directors, but Peter Jackson has done the "impossible" and created at least two movies that will go down in history as a couple of the most ambitious and titanic fantasy adaptions ever made. I only know a little of what to expect in December 2003, but if the previous two films are any indication it will be a grand spectacle.I've seen the Two Towers in theaters three times so far, giving it the most in-theater replay value of any movie in my history. The reasons I keep coming back are several...epic battle scenes, whether they take place in ancient Rome, on the battlefields of Vietnam or France or in medievel England are something that have taken over movies of the last few years - The Two Towers creates the longest and greatest battle I've ever seen on film, an hour passes like minutes as we watch Helm's Deep almost fall then rise and conquer. Strong characters like Viggio Mortensen's Aragorn and the amazing CGI Gollum made me want to see their performances again and again.There were a few Hollywood moments that I didn't remember seeing in FOTR and that I could've done without - Legolas riding the shield down the staircase at Helm's Deep and the comic "relief" of Gimili. These small moments taint an otherwise seemless movie, but not enough to lessen its 10 star rating in my eyes.It was such an amazing undertaking, such a dedicated work and such a risky endevour - these movies could have failed miserably had Mr. Jackson not been 100% dedicated to perfection and details within these films. Reading the "Making Of..." book, I realized even more that we are watching history unfolding and massive standards being set for future films of this and all other genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughter and I loved the movie and will probably see it again. If you liked FOTR you will not be disappointed. From the very beginning to the ending credits it was exciting. Andy Serkis was brilliant as Gollum. Before seeing the movie I watched a program on how he did his voice and movements and how they put on CGI. Viggo was impressive and strong as Agragorn. Was really impressed with Sean as SamWise looking out for Frodo and Elija as Frodo with the effect the ring is having on him now. Orlando Bloom is handsome as ever as Legolas. An added treat was Bernard Hill as King Théoden. He is one of my new favorites. If I had to fault the movie with anything it would be that I didn't get to see enough of Karl Urban as Éomér, David Wenham as Faramir, and Miranda Otto as Éowyn. Hope to see much more of them in ROTK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tolkien created a world with depth of huge proportions and this is portrayed to great effect in these films. Only with todays technology can it be portrayed so well. These films are a feat of planning and project management if nothing else. Two Towers has everything you could get into a film, action, war, romance, character developmennt, intrigue....I loved it and have seen it three times already! Some may find it slow going for the first hour or so, but watch it carefully as you see more elements of the whole story being brought together. Gollum is a fantastic technological achievment and almost steals the show if it wasn't for everything else going on. The battle scenes are amazing. There are differences (a good number to) with the book but I think its worth letting them pass, the film does justice to Tolkiens creation. Truly great film making, what will Jackson do next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of comments here that will tell you how good this movie is. I agree, it is a wonderful movie, however I would like to comment on a few things that I didn't like. These things have more to do with the adaption of the book rather than the quality of the movie itself.Firstly where is Faramir? I noticed his name appeared but his character as in the book is nowhere near. Faramir is supposedly his brother's opposite, showing that men aren't all bad. Also that Boromir's fate wasn't bound to the fact that his father is Steward (king) of Gondor. Faramir is exactly like Boromir, greedy, thinking first of his own glory rather than the survival of Middle Earth.** perhaps spoiler ** Another thing is Aragorn's 'fake' death. Pretty pointless, clearly not from the book and does nothing for the plot of the movie. He just disappears and the reappears a little later. Peter Jackson could have left this part out easily and instead spent more time on the Ents for instance.I however cannot complain about this movie because it is visually stunning and the acting is very impressive, especially from Andy Serkis. 9/10 (because I am a big fan of the books).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the first of the trilogy and/or read the book, don't bother going to this movie. Total confusion for three hours; such that, at the end of the film, the uninitiated don't even known what the two towers are/were. The movie is designed for the viewer (i.e., sucker)to run out and rent the first volume because we pick up right where that left off a year ago (which is when I saw it) and the viewer is expected to know exactly where that was, who all these people (and things) are and so on. Then a bunch of kings and princes with beards show up, and I'm sorry but I just don't have time to tell them apart. Then there's that masochistic goblet or gobbin or some such thing prancing in a loin cloth with bug eyes and incessantly talking to himself. It's just too much, including all the fight scenes which go by so fast you can't figure who shot who. Great New Zealand scenery and excellent special effects might be worth the price of admission. However, this must be breaking sales records with repeat viewers who have an extra three hours (plus 15 minutes of previews) to see it twice in an attempt to figure it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is this gibbering nonsense about Faramir &amp; the CGI?warning - spoilers! -------------------It seems that nitpickers and ninnies have latched on to two particular aspects of TTT to try and claim the film is rubbish. Both points are particularly hollow:Faramir - various issues have been raised:1) he is too similar to Boromir - they are brothers for fricks sake - what do you expect? In the book Faramir is described as close to Boromir but closer to the true line of Numenor.2) He does not let the hobbits go at the Forbidden Pool but drags them to Osgiliath? And? So what? Does this really diminish him? He still does the right thing in the end.3) Everyone in Gondor seems to know of the Ring. No, totally incorrect if you actually watched the film4) His life becomes forfeit for letting the Ring go. No, amazingly incorrect for supposed fans of the book to complain - his life becomes forfeit for letting the hobbits go. By decree of the Steward of Gondor any individuals found in its territory near Mordor must be killed or taken as prisoner to Gondor - because Denethor suspects the Ring is returning to Mordor - as is explained in the book if you could read.5) The Nazgul sequence looks false - really?6) The CGI sucks? What planet exactly do you folks live on? Or have you returned from some distant future where CGI has reached unknown levels?Frankly every comment against this film can be categorised under 3 subsets:1) People whose bums seem to demand more of their attention than anything else so they cannot sit through a 3 hour film - deserve some pity for a painful physical condition2) People who simply have no appreciation of anything with a 'fantasy' premise as they have no imagination whatsoever - deserve even more pity for the drab and dreary lives they must lead3) People who simply like to jump up &amp; down and scream 'look at me, I'm different, I know something you all don't, look, look!!!' - deserve no pity whatsoever as they are the same types that make life a pain for everyone in any arena.Give it a break. This is a great film. Not the greatest. But still great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say openly at the outset of this review that I have attempted to read the story several times and have always found it stodgy and impenetrable. I suppose one either has affinity for Dark-Ages style sword-boilers, or one does not. For fantasy I prefer the multi-layered mysticism of C.S. Lewis and for sci-fi the brightly-coloured hyper-detail of Frank Herbert. So saying that The Two Towers is tedious, portentous and doesn't amount to very much in its volume of narrative is like a non-Wagner fan sitting through all sixteen hours of The (other) Ring and complaining that nothing much really happens. So, I'll exasperate all the Tolkien acolytes here by saying that overall the story is reasonably well-paced and engrossing enough for the non-fanatics to enjoy. Costumes, sets and art direction are all excellent and Viggo Mortensen makes a charismatic lead. Also a constant source of delight is the octogenarian Christopher Lee doing his best Osama impression, raging impotently from his bedroom at the destruction of Isengard like an imam being woken early on a Sunday morning by a leaf-blower. The character of Gollum also is destined to be one of the movies' unforgettable, classic creations - his mental torment so beautifully conveyed, the conflict of greed and loyalty so clearly defined, he appears like a psychotic, hallucinating version of Yoda. The film comes alive every second Gollum appears on the screen To the negative aspects. As I said at the outset, not a lot happens over the course of three hours. The hobbits go on walking, our heroes appear on endless helicopter shots running or riding, and there's a battle at the end. That's it. Characters are already established so no further exposition is needed, but what we get is an awful lot of (sometimes exquisitely lovely) padding. I know this is a Celtic-style fantasy, but why does the dialogue have to be so heavy, slow and mock-Shakespearian? Surely Tolkien didn't originally write all this stuff? He did, you say? Geez! I'm sure to the reverential Tolkien-ites the characters drip pearls from their very lips each time they open them, but to me it all sounded rather like a po-faced version of Conan the Barbarian, minus the humour. Howard Shore's music also struck this reviewer as rather pedestrian and missing the required Wagnerian touch, and not enough (nearly enough!) of the delectable Liv Tyler. All-in-all, a bum-numbing haul along the road of synthetic lyricism, with seemingly more emphasis placed on not alienating Tolkien fans than on attracting new ones. I can guess the next one - the short people give the ring back and good triumphs over evil, right? I hope that doesn't spoil it for anybody..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild spoilersGreat film, full of great action scenes, directing, acting, and the scenic backdrops blew me away. However I enjoyed the first one more. I was expecting, like everyone else, TTT to top FOTR in just about every aspect, which it did not.The "weakness" with this film compared to the first, is not following up the great characters and their portrayals on screen. Maybe the fact that the first film was supposed to get us into the characters more, and the 2nd is to emphasize new characters, (which was mediocre) however, we need to care about all principle characters in the moment, we don't want to remember how they were, we want to re-discover what made us love them in the first film. This I don't believe was well done.Scenic shots, and backgrounds are absolutely fantastic. In FOTR, we had a great comparison of these `small' hobbits in such a large world. In TTT, I had that same feeling. The size of the Black Gate and Helm's Deep stood out above all, especially the remarkable battle scene that took place.Overall, of course it is a definite recommendation, but don't expect the acting to surpass the first, but expect the overall astonishing visuals to keep you gripping your seat, asking for more. It will be a tortuous 12 months for the next. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible work. I can't wait to experience the trilogy as a whole.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I that read Lord of the Rings I was eleven years old -in love with fantasy and television- and I knew no one would ever be able to bring Tolkien to life on the big screen. I was wrong. Kudos to Peter Jackson and an amazing group of talented people. The Fellowship was awesome. A beautiful expression of Tolkien's Middle Earth. I didn't think the Two Towers could really pull that same level in the middle of a trilogy. Again, I was wrong. Just amazing. And now I have to wait another year for the finale. Arg! But this time I believe. Thank you. Just hold me down when all three are released in extended DVD. I'll be in front of the tele for a day. I hope! Don't read any farther if you have not seen the movie. Possible minor spoilers ahead. And now that I've said that. I do have a complaint. I wish someone had caught the two sword problems in the movie. The first: when Aragorn went over the cliff . Didn't anyone think that after being knocked off his horse in the middle of the battle he would not take the time to sheath his long sword? That just doesn't make sense. And than there's Sting. Frodo and Sam are captured and someone gave Frodo his weapon back? Or they didn't take it away? Then there's that shot where Gandalf is clearly holding onto the 'non-existent' saddle on Shadowfax. And didn't Mary and Pipin cut/remove their ropes after the 'horse incident'? He clearly has his arms open and up when the horse is coming down. And then, okay, I'm sorry. I know I'm being picky. But this movie is so gorgeous , so beautifully made- it's a true vision -that I just wanted perfection. I guess I can settle with a work of art. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Movie Even With Changes From the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Peter Jackson, with his cast and crew, completely baffled me and many other audiences with The Two Towers. Yes, its true that it's not 100% true to the book, but lets face it: As Stephen King says, "Movies and books are like apples and oranges. They're both delicious, but taste completely different." Personally, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I would love to see them adapt every single line of the books to the screen. However, it would be impractical and would probably only please big Tolkien fans like myself.Even with changes in effect, it seems to me that the movie's most powerful themes (good vs. evil, Love between Frodo and Sam, corruption of the ring, etc)are 100% true to the books. In the end, thats what, I believe, the audience will value most.Overall, the movie was amazing. For action-lovers, the Two Towers is much more action-packed than the Fellowship, and portrayal of the battle at Helm's Deep is downright incredible. Other pluses include: excellent adaptation of Gollum and the Ents, and excellent acting. Excellent work, Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew - Keep it up! Waiting a year for the third will be torture but based on the first two films, absolutely worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my oppinion on that film is that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion is that although it had some great scenes of action, after the first hour ,had nothing to do with the book. A lot of junk was added to the film. From the love-story of Arwen and Aragorn ,to the elvish army in Deep of Helm (there was no such thing in the book) along with the orc-wolf attack to the people (where did this come from?) to the attempt to persuade the Ents by Pippin (their decision was instant), the lose of the torture feeling by hunger and thirst of Froddo and Sam, Faramir's decision to take froddo with him (not such thing happened) and last the worst of all the confrontation of Froddo to the black rider so close to Mordor. This totally sucked since the whole journey of the fellowship of the ring was based on the secrecy of this trip. I would not speak of the cut of five chapters of the book about the Shellob spider ,since this could be added to the next film (I really hope so!) So in my opinion it was a nice action adventure film that had NOTHING TO DO WITH TOLKJIEN. A real boxoffice buster but a total failure regarding the Trilogy about the ring. So the fact remains. If you really want to have that sensational feeling of this masterpiece ,BUY THE BOOKS. They are several classes superior than the films... Too bad ,cause the first film really ,got me going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Entertaining yet mildly worrying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of movie. You can argue whether or not the changes are good or bad, add anything or detract. The stilted script isn't too much of an issue; this isn't a soap opera, after all. It isn't the effect on THIS film that counts. It's just that Jackson's approach to the Two Towers is making me a little anxious about his future handling of ROTK. For Jackson has created Middle-Earth for us, so forcefully and beautifully, that we can actually start wondering what would make ROTK the show-stopper. He has the chance to make the third film one of the most beautifully balanced, moving, poignant yet uplifting ever run through a projector. So can he pull it back to capture the poetry (not literal!) of the last book, or will he succumb to the temptation to make the battles bigger and bigger? For the pay-off, ROTK has to display a subtlety not always evident in TTT.so what will make the difference between another brilliant Epic and the one we really all want? It isn't a question about slavish adherence to the book, but the way it hangs together is nonetheless the key.Frodo has already flashed his ring at a Nazgul, but, once Minas Tirith has held, the entire purpose of Aragorn, his fellow generals and the army is to stop Sauron noticing that his ring is on its way to Mount Doom. Faramir saw him do it! How to re-forge the integrity of the plot?The battle before the Black Gate isn't a battle. It isn't a desperate play for survival, like Helm's Deep. It is a sacrifice. The last army (no elves, now, we hope - they are a spent force) don't even know if the ring is still abroad, but they know this is the only gamble left. Will Jackson get it?The lord of the Nazgul is going to ride up to the gates of Gondor. Gandalf will block him. This Nazgul needs to inspire dread and loathing. In comparison, the Balrog, your average Alien and Dracula must feel like Noddy's tea-time companions.

		<shortDescription>Roll on Return of the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people who saw this film, I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. While it is not without some flaws overall it deserves the praise it has received. (Please excuse the spoilers ahead).For those of you who found it a bit disjointed just remember that the film encompasses two major plot lines - events in Rohan and Frodo heads to Mordor - plus the minor one of Merry and Pippin's escapades. No matter how the director tries to fit them together it won't suit all viewers. Additionally, as the middle part of a trilogy it was always going to be difficult to make it stand on its own as well as the first. But just wait until 2004 when you can watch all three in a row....For those of you who have made comments about film quality, the CGI used to overlay the digital Gollum over the actor Andy Cserkis, etc, I highly recommend getting the DVD extended edition pack that has two discs devoted to the making of the first film.Just sit back and enjoy the action, scenery, music and adventure. Appreciate the scope of the movies and the effort made for realism (for example, two guys spent about 18 months full time just making suits of chainmail). Read the books and if possible watch FoTR again before you see TTT. Sure it is a long movie and slow in parts but what movie isn't. And don't get caught up with trying to compare it to other great movies (if you think the Godfather movies are the pinnacle of cinema excellence, fine, but they are not the LoTR trilogy and should not be rated against each other).As for some of the other issues people have commented/complained about...1. Faramir - I agree that Jackson was a bit harsh on him but I believe Tolkien himself was a bit generous towards him. Imagine you are the commander of military forces guarding your borders from huge evil and two little guys turn up carrying a powerful artifact that in the wrong hands would destroy your land. I think Faramir would have been suspicious of their motives (as he was at first in the book) and not basically say "off you go lads, here's some food, head due east to Mordor, you can't miss it - high mountains, volcanoes and a squillion orcs". Wait for the third movie to see him more in tune with the Faramir of the books. His change of heart and allowing the hobbits to leave is, I suspect, also part of setting the conflict with, and within, his father Denethor in the next book.2. Shelob - don't worry she will be in the next movie. Gollum basically says so at the end of TTT. Who cares whether she was in the second book but not in the second movie.3. Elves at Helm's Deep are a symbol of the wider conflict - Peter Jackson is trying to convey in the movie what was covered in a few lines in the books - namely that forces of evil were fighting elves, men and dwarves elsewhere while the fighting in Gondor and Rohan was occurring. I would not find it unusual if the third movie had dwarves appearing at the siege of Minas Tirith to further symbolise the alliance of the three races. The sequence with Elrond and Galdriel was necessary to explain why the elves would be at Helm's Deep.4. Aragorn and Eowyn - this bit is basically showing Eowyn's infatuation with a powerful, handsome and noble man (which is touched upon in Tolkien's writings somewhere). Cliched? Perhaps, but in real life romance, when you look closely, is often cliched. Why should the movies be any different? I have to admit that the bit with Aragorn falling off the cliff is a bit unnecessary - perhaps the extended version might make it clearer.5. Arwen and Aragorn - some found this theme slow and laboured. But remember she is considering giving up immortality for Aragorn, not just deciding what colour gossamer dress to wear that day. It is an integral theme to Tolkien's work.</fullReview>

Maybe the fact that the first film was supposed to get us into the characters more, and the 2nd is to emphasize new characters, (which was mediocre) however, we need to care about all principle characters in the moment, we don't want to remember how they were, we want to re-discover what made us love them in the first film. This I don't believe was well done.Scenic shots, and backgrounds are absolutely fantastic. In FOTR, we had a great comparison of these `small' hobbits in such a large world. In TTT, I had that same feeling. The size of the Black Gate and Helm's Deep stood out above all, especially the remarkable battle scene that took place.Overall, of course it is a definite recommendation, but don't expect the acting to surpass the first, but expect the overall astonishing visuals to keep you gripping your seat, asking for more.

		<shortDescription>Incredible Movie Even With Changes From the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Peter Jackson, with his cast and crew, completely baffled me and many other audiences with The Two Towers. Yes, its true that it's not 100% true to the book, but lets face it: As Stephen King says, "Movies and books are like apples and oranges. They're both delicious, but taste completely different." Personally, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I would love to see them adapt every single line of the books to the screen. However, it would be impractical and would probably only please big Tolkien fans like myself.Even with changes in effect, it seems to me that the movie's most powerful themes (good vs. evil, Love between Frodo and Sam, corruption of the ring, etc)are 100% true to the books. In the end, thats what, I believe, the audience will value most.Overall, the movie was amazing. For action-lovers, the Two Towers is much more action-packed than the Fellowship, and portrayal of the battle at Helm's Deep is downright incredible. Other pluses include: excellent adaptation of Gollum and the Ents, and excellent acting. Excellent work, Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew - Keep it up! Waiting a year for the third will be torture but based on the first two films, absolutely worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my oppinion on that film is that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion is that although it had some great scenes of action, after the first hour ,had nothing to do with the book. A lot of junk was added to the film. From the love-story of Arwen and Aragorn ,to the elvish army in Deep of Helm (there was no such thing in the book) along with the orc-wolf attack to the people (where did this come from?) to the attempt to persuade the Ents by Pippin (their decision was instant), the lose of the torture feeling by hunger and thirst of Froddo and Sam, Faramir's decision to take froddo with him (not such thing happened) and last the worst of all the confrontation of Froddo to the black rider so close to Mordor. This totally sucked since the whole journey of the fellowship of the ring was based on the secrecy of this trip. I would not speak of the cut of five chapters of the book about the Shellob spider ,since this could be added to the next film (I really hope so!) So in my opinion it was a nice action adventure film that had NOTHING TO DO WITH TOLKJIEN. A real boxoffice buster but a total failure regarding the Trilogy about the ring. So the fact remains. If you really want to have that sensational feeling of this masterpiece ,BUY THE BOOKS. They are several classes superior than the films... Too bad ,cause the first film really ,got me going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon that this is the greatest movie ever made. I disagree. First, let me say that I have read all three books in the trilogy twice, and I love this story. However, this was too long. It may just be that Tolkien's books are too much to try to put into a movie. I will say that this was probably the best effort that could be made by a human. But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books. The battle sequences were not emotionally engaging. And the orcs are too "over-the-top" scary for my taste. I did like the sequences between Frodo, Sam and Gollum. The portrayal of the ring's effect on Frodo was well done.All-in-all, this is a downer of a movie. It's the book in the trilogy that is the darkest. Hopefully, the third movie will be a good uplifting ending to this set of three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Fellowship came out, I did not think it would be possible to top that film, and I was right. But the Two Towers is a mighty film in its own right, although you definitely need the first installment to understand what is going on. But then, Peter Jackson has always said that it is one huge film divided into three parts. I have seen this one twice and was very impressed by the way they were able to seriously move away from Tolkien´s TEXT, and at the same time seriously honor Tolkien´s SPIRIT. Sure, the Warg battle was not in that same spot in the book, but it was in the book AND in The Hobbit. Sure, Faramir was very unlike his brother in the book, but admit it, he was a rather talky, boring character in The Two Towers book. This has been amended in the film, for it to work as a FILM. Great work there, and it never bothered me - and I have read the books about 35 times, in several languages. Gollum is just so breathtaking. I could not believe it was all CGI, but apparently it is. Incredible, simply incredible. Let us put to rest the old Yoda - he´s using a cane anyway. Except when fighting, of course. Great movie, cannot wait to see The Return of the King.</fullReview>

It's the book in the trilogy that is the darkest. Hopefully, the third movie will be a good uplifting ending to this set of three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Fellowship came out, I did not think it would be possible to top that film, and I was right. But the Two Towers is a mighty film in its own right, although you definitely need the first installment to understand what is going on. But then, Peter Jackson has always said that it is one huge film divided into three parts. I have seen this one twice and was very impressed by the way they were able to seriously move away from Tolkien´s TEXT, and at the same time seriously honor Tolkien´s SPIRIT. Sure, the Warg battle was not in that same spot in the book, but it was in the book AND in The Hobbit. Sure, Faramir was very unlike his brother in the book, but admit it, he was a rather talky, boring character in The Two Towers book. This has been amended in the film, for it to work as a FILM. Great work there, and it never bothered me - and I have read the books about 35 times, in several languages. Gollum is just so breathtaking. I could not believe it was all CGI, but apparently it is. Incredible, simply incredible. Let us put to rest the old Yoda - he´s using a cane anyway. Except when fighting, of course. Great movie, cannot wait to see The Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Movie Even With Changes From the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Peter Jackson, with his cast and crew, completely baffled me and many other audiences with The Two Towers. Yes, its true that it's not 100% true to the book, but lets face it: As Stephen King says, "Movies and books are like apples and oranges. They're both delicious, but taste completely different." Personally, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I would love to see them adapt every single line of the books to the screen. However, it would be impractical and would probably only please big Tolkien fans like myself.Even with changes in effect, it seems to me that the movie's most powerful themes (good vs. evil, Love between Frodo and Sam, corruption of the ring, etc)are 100% true to the books. In the end, thats what, I believe, the audience will value most.Overall, the movie was amazing. For action-lovers, the Two Towers is much more action-packed than the Fellowship, and portrayal of the battle at Helm's Deep is downright incredible. Other pluses include: excellent adaptation of Gollum and the Ents, and excellent acting. Excellent work, Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew - Keep it up! Waiting a year for the third will be torture but based on the first two films, absolutely worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw the point 2nd time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the Two Towers I thought the changes very distracting and incomplete. 2nd time around I stopped comparing it to the book and actually enjoyed it very much, there is some extra depth introduced to the characters and the story, the success of this extra depth is normally revealed if there is an improvement on further viewings.The movie suffers a little from trying to be all things to all people, however its more interesting in the long run for having more angles. I spoke to some people who thought the love story was their favourite part. If more care is taken with the story lines, humour, action and dialogue, there will be more immediacy as well as depth.I hope Peter Jackson takes his time a bit more with the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Entertaining yet mildly worrying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of movie. You can argue whether or not the changes are good or bad, add anything or detract. The stilted script isn't too much of an issue; this isn't a soap opera, after all. It isn't the effect on THIS film that counts. It's just that Jackson's approach to the Two Towers is making me a little anxious about his future handling of ROTK. For Jackson has created Middle-Earth for us, so forcefully and beautifully, that we can actually start wondering what would make ROTK the show-stopper. He has the chance to make the third film one of the most beautifully balanced, moving, poignant yet uplifting ever run through a projector. So can he pull it back to capture the poetry (not literal!) of the last book, or will he succumb to the temptation to make the battles bigger and bigger? For the pay-off, ROTK has to display a subtlety not always evident in TTT.so what will make the difference between another brilliant Epic and the one we really all want? It isn't a question about slavish adherence to the book, but the way it hangs together is nonetheless the key.Frodo has already flashed his ring at a Nazgul, but, once Minas Tirith has held, the entire purpose of Aragorn, his fellow generals and the army is to stop Sauron noticing that his ring is on its way to Mount Doom. Faramir saw him do it! How to re-forge the integrity of the plot?The battle before the Black Gate isn't a battle. It isn't a desperate play for survival, like Helm's Deep. It is a sacrifice. The last army (no elves, now, we hope - they are a spent force) don't even know if the ring is still abroad, but they know this is the only gamble left. Will Jackson get it?The lord of the Nazgul is going to ride up to the gates of Gondor. Gandalf will block him. This Nazgul needs to inspire dread and loathing. In comparison, the Balrog, your average Alien and Dracula must feel like Noddy's tea-time companions. Will he go for it?It is one of the ironies of the story that, as Frodo succumbs finally and completely to the ring, and Gollum bites his finger off in yet another replay of Sauron's downfall in the Prologue, the destiny of Middle-Earth is actually decided by luck / fate / Wyrd as Gollum stumbles. Despite all the valiant efforts of Men to distract, Frodo and Sam to reach the Mountain and even Gollum to intervene, the ring is finally destroyed by chance. If you can capture that, Mr. Jackson, then you can take your seat next to Kurosawa and Coppola.The last stroke of the war ought to fall on Frod's doorstep - a wonderful symmetry, and some trouble in the Shire will incidentally also allow Rose Cotton to deliver potentially one of the greatest one liners in cinema history (if you've read the book you'll know...)Sam must be utterly floored when he sees Elrond and Galadriel in that line-up on the way to the Havens. This is one of the emotional climaxes of the film. And Gandalf ought to be held back to the Havens. It would be a diminishment if he wasn't.All I'm saying is: ROTK depends on a lot more than CGI, sweepy camera syndrome and big battles, however brilliantly they have been executed (and they were!!) We know PJ can do that stuff, but he has to be brave to make his real mark. It is cinematically possible, and he hasn't really done anything to the plot to stop him. I am just hoping I can enjoy the Two Towers as a deliberate, superbly crafted, titanic action curtain-raiser to a very different kind of climax.Over to you, Peter Jackson. Drop me a line if you want!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping film that lives up to the first despite complaints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen THE TWO TOWERS I found myself fairly speechless. The movie delighted me. I thought I'd have an impossible time sitting through a three hour movie (even though I loved the first). I found myself to not be bored or even confused throughout the entire time. That in itself is an accomplishment. Peter Jackson did an amazing job of keeping the storyline clear amongst all the action. Often it's easy to lose track of what's going on, but TTT really avoided that problem. Overall I give it a 10/10. I realize a perfect rating is probably not the wisest to give. Because I have yet to see THE RETURN OF THE KING, I do not know if TTT is really the best of the trilogy. I did enjoy it even more than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, if that is possible, though that movie is tremendously enjoyable too.I'd like to comment on some of the other comments I've read. Regarding Erowen's large role in the film compared to the book. I have yet to read the books, so I can't really compare her place in each. I do think it's probably a shame that so much time was devoted to developing her relationship with Aragorn, causing much else to be left out. It stinks when movies add characters/create new events...but this is an adaptation of the books. Sometimes things in the books have to change to make sense on the screen. And sometimes Hollywood wants to flesh out interesting characters/scenarios that they think will play well on the screen, such as has been done with the trilogy. Also, this film lacks the character development that I thought it would have. Frodo clearly is slipping more and more into the evil grips of the ring, but that is not nearly as explored as it was in the first film. None of the other characters are explored as much either, although Gimli is given a chance to show his sense of humor (I do hope we get to see some depth in Legolas too, although the cold/distant feeling he gives off is really rather appropriate for an elf). These are issues with the movie, but seeing as how it was able to accomplish as much as it did in the time it did, they are easy to set somewhat aside.Regardless of the many changes that have been made, I think the films are excellent. I am waiting in great anticipation for the final movie. I can hardly imagine how I'll stand waiting a year! I guess that's what the novels are for, right??I recommend these movies to anyone over the age of 10 or so. They are great adventure stories. They're a little heavy on the violence at times, but outside of a few unique moves made by Legolas (i.e. when he mounts the moving horse, when he 'skateboards' down the stairs, jumps on the cave troll's head), the violance does not seem so stylized or glorified even, as it does in most movies. TTT is a film worthy of Tolkien's novels. I'm sure the changes would have pained him some, but seeing the characters come to life as fully as they did, seeing Middle Earth become such a reality, is truly breathtaking, something Tolkien might have appreciated as well.</fullReview>

The "Fellowship" developed the characters and set the story. It introduced us to a new mythology and by doing this it created cinematic awe. The "Two Towers" book mainly describes action. It describes who goes where and who does what. It was expected that a movie describing the events in this book would not be as exciting as the first part. For this reason director Peter Jackson added his own "inventions" into the story and by doing this he made mortal enemies among the J. R. R. Tolkien fans. I would say Peter Jackson's effort was fair enough. However, what he could have done was to invent a totally new cinematic style for telling the Tolkien story in the big screen. The new cinematic style would help him adapt the book without any alterations. Instead Jackson followed the well known action style of the Star Wars and Braveheart movies. I do not know if the outcome would be better if Peter Jackson had done differently. Perhaps his choices were right on target. Bottom line: Well done.

But today I went to the IMDB Message Boards and My opinion of people who can't spell or type should definitely try to keep the negative comments to themselves when it come to LOTR Twin Towers. It just shows there lack of maturity and intelligence when it come to commenting on a masterpiece epic motion picture that should be an Oscar contender on all levels. Peter Jackson's direction in this trilogy was brilliant better then the first and will probably finish of with the final block buster. Now I could be wrong, but come on with 200m in the first two weeks, we all can't be wrong! I've seen it twice and will probably see it again. I love this movie and I think it should go down in history as a modern day EPIC Trilogy, and rank it up there with Gone with the Wind, Sound of Music, Star Wars, The Godfather......... I love to comment on great movies and you all can read all the comments you want, but go see this one for yourself and be visually stimulated and taken away to a magical mystical place of good verses evil, that will leave you yearning for December 17th 2003.

		<fullReview>Hey, I just HAVE to comment on this wonderful film AGAIN to start the new year off.  I, who am known by my friends and family as a "Lord of the Rings" obsessee, went to see this film opening night with high expectations. Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job with the first installment, I felt no need to worry about the second being any worse. I went in shaking like a leaf, full of anticipation and excitement. I left dazed and limp. Like the first film, the special FX are incredible, the acting superb, the landscape breathtaking, the creatures believable, and the sound editing mind-blowing. I must comment specifically on the latter two, using the Ents as an example. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull off a walking, talking, thinking tree. I was more worried about Treebeard being believable, than I was Gollum. I needn't have fretted over it. The floor of the theatre actually rumbled when Treebeard talked, an aspect of his personality and character that Tolkien described vividly in the books. The acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality. That was such a powerful and moving scene, my eyes watered. Peter Jackson captured him beautifully, showing that he isn't entirely evil but isn't entirely good, making him an incredibly sad character that twists and tugs at your emotions. His Gollum matches Tolkien's Gollum perfectly.  Aragorn giving battle commands in Elvish on the walls of Helm's Deep were also great scenes -- speaking fluently and powerfully, the fierceness in his voice mixed with the determined look in his eyes was thrilling to watch. Elijah Wood was also amazing, somehow altering his feelings toward the Ring and actually becoming a different person. This I found impressive, since they shot totally out of sequence when they made the movies. Merry and Pippen, who provided much of the comic relief in "The Fellowship of the Ring," still have a certain cute flare, but are much more aware of the seriousness of the situation now that they are alone and without the protection of the Fellowship. They seemed to have handed over the puns and cute lines to Gimli. Bottom line: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Even if you don't like fantasy (which I didn't until I saw "The Fellowship of the Ring"), the Battle of Helm's Deep is well worth the seven bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Tolkien's tale to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is the middle piece of Tolkien's masterful fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. Although written to entertain children, this story becomes PG-13 entertainment on the screen. This section of the author's tale is actually many stories in one. Following the first installment, The Fellowship, it continues to follow the surviving characters as they now move along different paths. Differing but related plots involve two seperated pair of Hobbits, one pair moving toward evil Mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring, the second, captured by the enemy, to eventually escape and take on the battle of one of the two towers. Other plots involve the transformation of Gandalf the gray wizard into a more powerful being, and the battles for two human cities. A new character, once known as Gollum is soon recognized as a relative of the Hobbits. Utterly destroyed by long possession of the ring this character truely bears the name Smeagol. He is a wonderfully digitized character. It was most difficult to believe that Smeagol was an animation. The story starts with the continuing battle of Gandalf and the creature in the caves of Moria. It continues, non stop with action and battle after action and battle. The war scenes are terrific. If not a fantasy, these scenes would rate with the battles of Private Ryan. As with the battle scenes, the entire movie is terrific, rating a strong 5. Hopefully, the academy can allow itself to give a Best Movie Oscar to a show made purely for entertainment. If ever a movie didn't disappoint after reading the book, this is it. A warning however, Two Towers is very graphic. It may have been written for children, but this director undoubtably made it for those of us that first read it years ago, and are now adults. It may give young tots nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien'strilogy loses none of the epic feel or the original, and adds aconsiderable amount of action/adventure to fill out the bill.One can admire the first-rate special effects and certain aspects ofthe visual design. A new character, one of the most realisticanimatronic creatures yet conceived, almost steals the show. Buteven in spite of all this, The Two Towers comes off as a bitbloated, repetitive, and even occasionally dull..The characters aren't particularly interesting. Ian McKellan as theWhite Wizard is again the standout performance; most everyoneelse lacks star quality. In particular, Liv Tyler speaks as if she's ina trance. Ironically, the most fascinating characters here arecomputer-generated: the talking trees, and a misshapen creaturewho once owned the Ring.Most of the film is painted in broad strokes, at once giving it amythic sense while making it feel too simple. The characters moveback and forth between being captured and released with very littleemotional payoff. The occasional humor boils down to charactersfalling falling on their faces. Worst of all, the film's dialog is completely generic, devoid ofcrackle and originality. No Oscar nominations for script this year.I was sitting next to some Ring fans on opening day. As theclosing theme came up and people began to leave, one of themsaid, "Gee. That was a disappointment." His pal nodded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the first film, there's not much to recommend this film unless you're willing to overlook the terrible CG, lackluster script, maudlin direction, and generally bad acting.Peter Jackson proves that he's not much of a director, simply resorting to slow motion to remind us that something terrible is about to happen (which is generally obvious in the juvenile script), while Howard Shore does the same with the music (if I had to hear the "ethereal" singing one more time during a battle scene, I might have been driven to insanity).In spite of what people are claiming about Golum, he's no more convincing than the pixies in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Worst of all dor a sequel, no recap is done for anyone who hadn't seen the first film. So in most theatres, you're bound to be sitting near a group of people who dragged a friend to this and have to explain what's going on throughout the film (eg. the show we saw had someone trying to explain why Frodo is important to the story even though his character has virtually nothing to do with the events depicted in Two Towers.)I might only have given this film a 2, but for the fact that the scenes with the Ents were actually reasonably done.Summary: For fans of Tolkien only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&amp;#65279;Anyone who writes their opinion on the IMDB user comments, I would guess, is an armature or wan-a-be movie critic and I am a firm believer that we all are entitled to our own opinions, fine. But today I went to the IMDB Message Boards and My opinion of people who can't spell or type should definitely try to keep the negative comments to themselves when it come to LOTR Twin Towers. It just shows there lack of maturity and intelligence when it come to commenting on a masterpiece epic motion picture that should be an Oscar contender on all levels. Peter Jackson's direction in this trilogy was brilliant better then the first and will probably finish of with the final block buster. Now I could be wrong, but come on with 200m in the first two weeks, we all can't be wrong! I've seen it twice and will probably see it again. I love this movie and I think it should go down in history as a modern day EPIC Trilogy, and rank it up there with Gone with the Wind, Sound of Music, Star Wars, The Godfather......... I love to comment on great movies and you all can read all the comments you want, but go see this one for yourself and be visually stimulated and taken away to a magical mystical place of good verses evil, that will leave you yearning for December 17th 2003.

		<fullReview>The continuation of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy is even more impressive than the first outing. The technical achievements remain spellbinding and the performances crisp. Minus the exposition of the first film, this one gets down to business from the getgo and keeps the pace going for most of the film. A few of the subplots do tend to drag a bit, but the big battle scenes are absolutely fantastic and the film is a major accomplishment. Too bad we have to wait a year for the conclusion of the saga.

		<shortDescription>My third comment of this stunning film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, I just HAVE to comment on this wonderful film AGAIN to start the new year off.  I, who am known by my friends and family as a "Lord of the Rings" obsessee, went to see this film opening night with high expectations. Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job with the first installment, I felt no need to worry about the second being any worse. I went in shaking like a leaf, full of anticipation and excitement. I left dazed and limp. Like the first film, the special FX are incredible, the acting superb, the landscape breathtaking, the creatures believable, and the sound editing mind-blowing. I must comment specifically on the latter two, using the Ents as an example. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull off a walking, talking, thinking tree. I was more worried about Treebeard being believable, than I was Gollum. I needn't have fretted over it. The floor of the theatre actually rumbled when Treebeard talked, an aspect of his personality and character that Tolkien described vividly in the books. The acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality. That was such a powerful and moving scene, my eyes watered. Peter Jackson captured him beautifully, showing that he isn't entirely evil but isn't entirely good, making him an incredibly sad character that twists and tugs at your emotions. His Gollum matches Tolkien's Gollum perfectly.  Aragorn giving battle commands in Elvish on the walls of Helm's Deep were also great scenes -- speaking fluently and powerfully, the fierceness in his voice mixed with the determined look in his eyes was thrilling to watch. Elijah Wood was also amazing, somehow altering his feelings toward the Ring and actually becoming a different person. This I found impressive, since they shot totally out of sequence when they made the movies. Merry and Pippen, who provided much of the comic relief in "The Fellowship of the Ring," still have a certain cute flare, but are much more aware of the seriousness of the situation now that they are alone and without the protection of the Fellowship. They seemed to have handed over the puns and cute lines to Gimli. Bottom line: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Even if you don't like fantasy (which I didn't until I saw "The Fellowship of the Ring"), the Battle of Helm's Deep is well worth the seven bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Tolkien's tale to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is the middle piece of Tolkien's masterful fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. Although written to entertain children, this story becomes PG-13 entertainment on the screen. This section of the author's tale is actually many stories in one. Following the first installment, The Fellowship, it continues to follow the surviving characters as they now move along different paths. Differing but related plots involve two seperated pair of Hobbits, one pair moving toward evil Mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring, the second, captured by the enemy, to eventually escape and take on the battle of one of the two towers. Other plots involve the transformation of Gandalf the gray wizard into a more powerful being, and the battles for two human cities. A new character, once known as Gollum is soon recognized as a relative of the Hobbits. Utterly destroyed by long possession of the ring this character truely bears the name Smeagol. He is a wonderfully digitized character. It was most difficult to believe that Smeagol was an animation. The story starts with the continuing battle of Gandalf and the creature in the caves of Moria. It continues, non stop with action and battle after action and battle. The war scenes are terrific. If not a fantasy, these scenes would rate with the battles of Private Ryan. As with the battle scenes, the entire movie is terrific, rating a strong 5. Hopefully, the academy can allow itself to give a Best Movie Oscar to a show made purely for entertainment. If ever a movie didn't disappoint after reading the book, this is it. A warning however, Two Towers is very graphic. It may have been written for children, but this director undoubtably made it for those of us that first read it years ago, and are now adults. It may give young tots nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien'strilogy loses none of the epic feel or the original, and adds aconsiderable amount of action/adventure to fill out the bill.One can admire the first-rate special effects and certain aspects ofthe visual design. A new character, one of the most realisticanimatronic creatures yet conceived, almost steals the show. Buteven in spite of all this, The Two Towers comes off as a bitbloated, repetitive, and even occasionally dull..The characters aren't particularly interesting. Ian McKellan as theWhite Wizard is again the standout performance; most everyoneelse lacks star quality. In particular, Liv Tyler speaks as if she's ina trance. Ironically, the most fascinating characters here arecomputer-generated: the talking trees, and a misshapen creaturewho once owned the Ring.Most of the film is painted in broad strokes, at once giving it amythic sense while making it feel too simple. The characters moveback and forth between being captured and released with very littleemotional payoff. The occasional humor boils down to charactersfalling falling on their faces. Worst of all, the film's dialog is completely generic, devoid ofcrackle and originality. No Oscar nominations for script this year.I was sitting next to some Ring fans on opening day. As theclosing theme came up and people began to leave, one of themsaid, "Gee. That was a disappointment." His pal nodded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the first film, there's not much to recommend this film unless you're willing to overlook the terrible CG, lackluster script, maudlin direction, and generally bad acting.Peter Jackson proves that he's not much of a director, simply resorting to slow motion to remind us that something terrible is about to happen (which is generally obvious in the juvenile script), while Howard Shore does the same with the music (if I had to hear the "ethereal" singing one more time during a battle scene, I might have been driven to insanity).In spite of what people are claiming about Golum, he's no more convincing than the pixies in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Worst of all dor a sequel, no recap is done for anyone who hadn't seen the first film. So in most theatres, you're bound to be sitting near a group of people who dragged a friend to this and have to explain what's going on throughout the film (eg. the show we saw had someone trying to explain why Frodo is important to the story even though his character has virtually nothing to do with the events depicted in Two Towers.)I might only have given this film a 2, but for the fact that the scenes with the Ents were actually reasonably done.Summary: For fans of Tolkien only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not from a Tolkien purist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Tolkien purist and so I found the movie to be very good. Not as good as the "Fellowship" though. The reason is obvious. The "Fellowship" developed the characters and set the story. It introduced us to a new mythology and by doing this it created cinematic awe. The "Two Towers" book mainly describes action. It describes who goes where and who does what. It was expected that a movie describing the events in this book would not be as exciting as the first part. For this reason director Peter Jackson added his own "inventions" into the story and by doing this he made mortal enemies among the J. R. R. Tolkien fans. I would say Peter Jackson's effort was fair enough. However, what he could have done was to invent a totally new cinematic style for telling the Tolkien story in the big screen. The new cinematic style would help him adapt the book without any alterations. Instead Jackson followed the well known action style of the Star Wars and Braveheart movies. I do not know if the outcome would be better if Peter Jackson had done differently. Perhaps his choices were right on target. Bottom line: Well done. Let's wait for the "Return of the King".</fullReview>

So in most theatres, you're bound to be sitting near a group of people who dragged a friend to this and have to explain what's going on throughout the film (eg. the show we saw had someone trying to explain why Frodo is important to the story even though his character has virtually nothing to do with the events depicted in Two Towers.)I might only have given this film a 2, but for the fact that the scenes with the Ents were actually reasonably done.Summary: For fans of Tolkien only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels are famous for not being as good as the first, however this movie doesn't disappoint. This movie is at least as good as the first one if not better. The fight scenes in this movie are amazing and everyone gives an incredible performance. If you are looking for action and if your looking for a movie that is worth 3hrs of your time this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not from a Tolkien purist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Tolkien purist and so I found the movie to be very good. Not as good as the "Fellowship" though. The reason is obvious. The "Fellowship" developed the characters and set the story. It introduced us to a new mythology and by doing this it created cinematic awe. The "Two Towers" book mainly describes action. It describes who goes where and who does what. It was expected that a movie describing the events in this book would not be as exciting as the first part. For this reason director Peter Jackson added his own "inventions" into the story and by doing this he made mortal enemies among the J. R. R. Tolkien fans. I would say Peter Jackson's effort was fair enough. However, what he could have done was to invent a totally new cinematic style for telling the Tolkien story in the big screen. The new cinematic style would help him adapt the book without any alterations. Instead Jackson followed the well known action style of the Star Wars and Braveheart movies. I do not know if the outcome would be better if Peter Jackson had done differently. Perhaps his choices were right on target. Bottom line: Well done. Let's wait for the "Return of the King".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic, no doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I don't review movies in great detail, but felt this time that I needed to add my thoughts - even if they probably are worth no more than two cents.After recently viewing TTT for the second time, I have to say that I enjoyed the movie so much more the second time. The first time, the spectator is simply bombarded with images (not to mention, when I saw it opening night, the theater cued the lights and cut the sound in the middle of the Helm's Deep battle which seriously ticked me off). However, the second time, you can settle in and look for other things you may have missed the second time (for example, who noted that as Wormtongue was looking out at Sarumon's army of 10,000 that were about to be unleashed onto Rohan, a single tear slipped down his face?) That, to me, spoke volumes. So, if you liked it the first time, or even if you didn't, but feel you can afford to spend more time in the theater, go see it again. Look for things you didn't notice before and prepared to be amazed and awed.For Tolkien purists, let me just say that I've read the books. No, not many times, but I have read them and recommended them to others. So what if not everything that happens in the book, happens in the movie? So what if things are added or changed? No where in the opening credits did it state "J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" (or, for that matter, "Peter Jackson's LOTR: TTT.") In the credits it states: "BASED ON." Get over it! It's a movie. If you're going to fight about something, try fighting for world peace instead. There's more important things going on!Of course, I state that, but am in the middle of writing this, so what do I know?Jackson has admitted, in interviews, that he took the most liberty with the storyline and adaptation of TTT more than the other two movies. (If you need to understand what "adaptation" means, go find a dictionary, but it certainly doesn't mean literal, word-for-word storytelling). Fine. He directed the movie and New Line Cinema owns the rights and since they were writing his paycheck that means he can do with the story what he wants. Be thrilled that he didn't completely butcher the books along the way (although, I'm sure, in your opinion, that he did exactly that). He told a story - an entertaining and timeless one. Just enjoy it.I plan on seeing this movie again - and will forgive the moments in the movie that I feel were unneeded, and be awed again by the scenes I downright enjoyed. Also, what do people have against "Gollum's Song?" If you listen to the words, it fits. (the use of "us" and "we" throughout the lyrics). Not to mention, the use of minor and major chords throughout [much like Gollum, himself. Is he good (major) or bad(minor).] And, the song ends on an unresolved chord - leaves you wanting more, much like the ending of the movie...just a few thoughts. I, for one, am looking forward to what Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, et. al., will give us in RotK. Until December '03.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional movie, with some questionable changes to the text</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it to be an extremely well made movie - one which requires, by reason of the sheer breadth of the material, that it be seen more than once. Same with the books, they require more than one reading.I was surprised by some of the changes Mr. Jackson made to the text. Specifically, Faramir's character in the movie was unlike that in the book; also, leaving out Shelob and the ending of the Twin Towers - perhaps there was a cinematic device to explain the changes, but if so they escaped me.That being said, Gollum's character was extraordinarily well rendered.I do not wish to indicate that the movie was not extremely good. It suffers from having as its source a text which is zealously read around the world. The fact of the matter is, there must always be some changes in the transference from script to screen.Mr. Jackson's movie(s) are truly amazing cinematic masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but really nothing much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read The Hobbit when I was very young and it was truly magical. Read Lord of the Rings a couple of times in my teens and it was wonderful. Saw the first film a few months ago in my late thirties and found it surprisingly entertaining. Waited eagerly for the this latest instalment and walked away disappointed.Why? Well, look again at the first film. It has magic, it has wit, it has charm, it has wonder. Simply put, from the charm and wit of the Shire and Bilbo Baggins, to the magic of the Elves and the wonder of those great statues (erect and fallen) as we enter Gondor, the film places us very firmly in Middle Earth.In this new film, wit seems to consist of poor "jokes" regarding Gimli's lack of height and Legolas speeding down a concrete staircase on a skateboard. Is this funny? The charm and sense of wonder has completely gone, and the magic that could (and should) have been created in the dark and mysterious forest of Fangorn has been replaced instead by a very amateurish rendering of the Ents. More than 10 years ago Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs convincingly to life, so what on earth has happened here with Treebeard and co.?Most sadly of all, I didn't once feel like I was in Middle Earth. To me, those panoramic background shots seemed all too often to be more the work of The New Zealand Tourist Authority than anything which Tolkien had conceived.Gollum, of course, WAS good, but isn't a little tragic when a movie's best and most three dimensional character is the result of a computer?I still look forward to the next episode, but whatever happens I know now that I can always console myself with one simple truth. While Jackson and Hollywood may destroy the movie, no one will ever be able to destroy the book(s).May generations of youngsters to come continue to read these works and find in them the feelings of magic and wonder which I too did all those years ago!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a worthy follow up to the seminal Fellowship of the Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without doubt, Peter Jackson has once again done justice to Tolkien's staggering literary achievement. This film, though much, much darker in tone than Fellowship, delivers the depth and breadth of the novel in dramatic and engrossing fashion.Although several portions of the book have been either omitted or amended for the silver screen, the story does not suffer in any way. Fans of the book may be disappointed that the Ents received short shrift, but when viewed through the average cinema goers eyes (i.e. one that has not had the benefit of reading the book)even the most ardent LOTR fan must agree that the changes made sense. Several characters enjoy more screen time, notably Gimli, who provides comic relief at times when the on screen drama demands it. My highlight was the image of the Ents descending on Isengard. CGI has never seemed more appealing.I for one will be counting down the days to "The Return of The king". I will also be keeping my fingers crossed that certain elements of that particular book make the final cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one who hasn't read the books, but has a deep appreciation of the fantasy/mythology genre, I viewed the film objectively, purely as a piece of cinema and with no expectations. The visuals are, for the most part, stunning. There are a few moments when the use of animation/models is obvious, which is a little disappointing, but overall, it's a feast for the eyes. Gollum is a spectacular piece of animation. The story moves along at a healthy pace, but is a little dull and uninvolving - Gollum being the only character that evokes any kind of emotional connection with the audience. The battle scenes are dramatic and exciting, but the comedy element is unnecessary. I also found the sight of Gandalf, appearing on the horizon like the Lone Ranger, at the moment of crisis, embarrassingly corny. For anyone wanting an evening of swords and sorcery, this is a reasonable film, but if you're looking for depth of character and to be swept away into another world for a couple of hours, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Where "Fellowship" Wasn't, but Still a Grand Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersLet me start by saying that I thought "Fellowship" was as close to perfection as film gets. A brilliant realization of the classic book, of which I am also a devout fan.But unlike other Tolkien devotees, I will not criticize this adaptation simply because it alters certain aspects of the novel. It is a necessary evil in converting a written medium to a visual one. I did not have a problem with Arwen's expanded role in "Fellowship," nor did I lament the loss of such characters as Tom Bombadil. All the changes Peter Jackson made to the first book worked sublimely well on screen.But he was not so wise in his adaptation of "The Two Towers." Many changes he made simply do not work. And by "not work," I mean in a purely cinematic sense. My reservations include:1) Aragorn going over the cliff. This is redundant in that the same thing happened to Gandalf. It is not suspenseful because in every trailer and TV spot we have seen Aragorn fight in the battle of Helm's Deep. It also dedicates far too much screen time to getting him back to the keep, thus slowing the film and accomplishing nothing save for forcing an unnecessary appearance of Arwen.2) The Ents get tricked. The oldest, wisest beings in Middle-earth yet they have no idea what's going on, nor do they offer to help until they are tricked by Merry and Pippin. Defeats the whole purpose of the Entmoot scene and belittles their characters.3) Shelob pushed to the 3rd film. I don't care what anyone says, this was a huge mistake. As written in the novels, the climax of "Towers" is a perfect, classic cliffhanger. It would have been on par with "The Empire Strikes Back," when Han is whisked away by Boba Fett and Luke learns a little about his family tree. Now imagine if "Empire" had ended BEFORE the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader and you get some idea of the error Jackson made here. He instead gives us a brief, anticlimactic aside to Osgilath where nothing really happens that hasn't happened before. Worst of all was Sam Gamgee turning into Sam Rockne with a "Some things are worth fighting for" speech that was so corny it made me laugh.I also felt the film didn't flow very well and could have been edited together much better. At several points in the movie I checked my watch and wondered, "I haven't seen Frodo and Sam for about 45 minutes. What the hell happened to that story?" In comparison, watch any of the "Star Wars" films and marvel at how perfectly they balance and fade to several concurrent story lines. "Towers" lacked this fluidity.Aside from these flaws, however, I greatly enjoyed "Towers." Its action sequences are unparalleled and the casting remains perfect. For pure visual flair this series sets the benchmark for everything else out there. I eagerly await "The Return of the King," which will hopefully live up to "Fellowship." The first film in this trilogy ranks a 10, but "Towers" falters slightly and falls to an 8.Score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic film making at its most spectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson has taken an `un-filmable' story and produced a true epic rich in the fantasy and myth that are inherent in the J.R.R. Tolkien books. There are naysayers out there that complain that the film doesn't follow the books ? but it does ? allowing for the vast scope and panorama of the original stories.The characters look and act exactly as I remember them from the books and the settings and scenes are far greater than what my poor imagination was ever able to conjure up. I was entirely prepared to not like this film; I was not completely sold on the first one. But Peter Jackson (director) and his wife Frances Walsh (screenwriter) have obviously poured their hearts and souls into this project ? not to mention years of their lives and the effort shows.There are so many sub-plots and interconnected stories that it is near impossible to keep them all straight ? but the tightly woven screenplay and the brilliant editing make it all work marvelously. There is not a miss-step or false note in the entire film. There were a couple of scenes that looked as if they could have been lifted right out of that other modern fairy tale: `The Wizard of Oz' but for the most part everything seemed original and fresh.Howard Shore's original score adds greatly to the overall feel of the film. It rises spectacularly at peak moments with a ?chorus of thousands' lending their talents and subsides quietly at moments of peace and tenderness.The Production Design and Art Direction (Grant Major and Peter Joe Bleakley, respectively) add to the grandeur and range that the film reaches for. The luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (not to mention the spectacular New Zealand settings) enhances the mystical and ?other-worldly' quality that the films strives for and achieves.This is a tightly woven piece of modern film making that should inspire filmmakers everywhere to strive for the best and hopefully, achieve it.</fullReview>

Since the entire story is new to me I went in with no preconceived ideas. The film's story, settings, and characters were fantastic and the effects were perfectly integrated to serve and strengthen the tale. Obviously, the costumes, makeup, and convincingly aged sets were spectacular.*** Spoilers aheadFavorite effects: The Ring Wraith's dragon, the chained trolls pulling Mordor's gate open, and the demented king's closeup as he returned to vibrant health.Favorite moments of power and beauty: The simple, pure, dreamily slow-motion arrival of Gandalf's white horse friend. The arrival of the elves at Helm's deep. The first glimpse of the gigantic crossbow. Aragorn's dream. Everything involving the Ents, especially their boulder-throwing, orc-stomping, dam-bursting battle against Isengard.Further praise of this inspiring film is pointless, as it speaks for itself perfectly. We are lucky to live in a time where creative people can produce groundbreaking artistic landmarks of such beauty and integrity. Thank you, New Line cinema!</fullReview>

The Movie doesn't really get good until The beginning of The Battle of Helm`s Deep.I feel bad Sir Ian McKellan is absent most of the movie. Gollum has some funny lines. But it is really Sam,and Frodo`s journey that makes the movie great. They are captured by Faramir (Brother of Sean Bean`s chacarter Boromir) He is certain The Evil Ring has the power to save The Country of Gondor. Frodo begin`s to lose faith. His faithful Servant Sam restore`s it. I love Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. He is truly a great character. Yet TTT is not like the novel at all.

		<fullReview>I have to say that on the whole I certainly did enjoy TTT. However it failed to grab and hold me in the way that Fellowship did. Perhaps it was the characters, or the long sitting time but I felt myself getting restless during the whole film and certainly noticed the three-hour sitting time unlike Fellowship. The battle at Helms Deep was by far the most impressive feature of the entire film. In fact if you take the battle away the rest is pretty unremarkable.Gollum. He was done very well. After the debacle of Jar Jar Binks in the new Star Wars films I was dreading the thought of another cgi main character. However old Gollum was a delight to watch and listen to. The character portray was just about perfect and the cgi far more impressive that Mr Lucas lame effort.Gollum was by far the most interesting character in the entire movie, he certainly had the most personality, a bit like the holographic Doctor in Star Trek Voyager. I know everyone raves about Aragorn and Legolas but I personally find them to be pretty bland individuals who get by on their brooding manner and handsome faces. They are not very gripping characters and their continual moping wears on you after a time. Merry and Pippin are far more fun to watch.As stated at the beginning I did enjoy the film but I felt it lacked the emotional impact of FOTR. There was no tear jerking moments like when Gandalf fell in Moria or the death of Boromir, it was just a big slugfest and special effects showcase. Frodo and Sam wandered about in circles most of the time and I felt a bit lost right along with them, like the film was wandering and trying to find its way. Non the less Return Of The King will hopefully put a bit of emotion back into the films and have us pulling at the heart strings like Fellowship did so well.7/10</fullReview>

It was a solid cramming of 3.5 hours of 'events', that didn't necessarily improve the quality of the movie.

When completed, I have no doubt that Peter Jackson's trilogy will be a defining moment in cinema history. We are watching the "Star Wars" of our time unfold before our eyes. I, for one, am really excited about that.As a previous poster stated: if you want to see a movie that's exactly like the book, don't see this movie. If you want to see a great movie, see this movie.

		<shortDescription>Great, but not perfect (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first. I loved Fellowship, especially the extended DVD version. I bought the BBC radio play on CD, to see what happened next and then i watched this. The first thing i was a little disappointed with was Gollum. His voice mainly, it was much better portrayed on the BBC play. What happened to all the lisping and stammering????Since watching this i've started reading the books and i'm currently in the second half of Two Towers.I've found that whereas Fellowship followed the crux of the book pretty well Two Towers has rather a lot of "artistic licence".For a start all the stuff about Aragorn falling into the river and dying and being brought back by Arwen - totally made up!!!! I've got past the Hornburg/Helms Deep bit and this doesn't happen. It appears Peter Jackson decided he wanted to concentrate on the Aragorn/Arwen/Eowyn love triangle and this was merely a device to focus attention on it.Also in the book some dispossessed Men are allied with Saroman and the Uruk-hai whereas in the film Saroman is committed to destroying all Men. I just think that the screenplay shouldn't have deviated this much from the book.The film is brilliant visually as was Fellowship, but it is just not as good as i thought it would be - Fellowship worked better as a film, and i'm particularly disappointed as the Radio play of Two Towers was by far the better of the three parts.Maybe the extended DVD will be more satisfying.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Where "Fellowship" Wasn't, but Still a Grand Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersLet me start by saying that I thought "Fellowship" was as close to perfection as film gets. A brilliant realization of the classic book, of which I am also a devout fan.But unlike other Tolkien devotees, I will not criticize this adaptation simply because it alters certain aspects of the novel. It is a necessary evil in converting a written medium to a visual one. I did not have a problem with Arwen's expanded role in "Fellowship," nor did I lament the loss of such characters as Tom Bombadil. All the changes Peter Jackson made to the first book worked sublimely well on screen.But he was not so wise in his adaptation of "The Two Towers." Many changes he made simply do not work. And by "not work," I mean in a purely cinematic sense. My reservations include:1) Aragorn going over the cliff. This is redundant in that the same thing happened to Gandalf. It is not suspenseful because in every trailer and TV spot we have seen Aragorn fight in the battle of Helm's Deep. It also dedicates far too much screen time to getting him back to the keep, thus slowing the film and accomplishing nothing save for forcing an unnecessary appearance of Arwen.2) The Ents get tricked. The oldest, wisest beings in Middle-earth yet they have no idea what's going on, nor do they offer to help until they are tricked by Merry and Pippin. Defeats the whole purpose of the Entmoot scene and belittles their characters.3) Shelob pushed to the 3rd film. I don't care what anyone says, this was a huge mistake. As written in the novels, the climax of "Towers" is a perfect, classic cliffhanger. It would have been on par with "The Empire Strikes Back," when Han is whisked away by Boba Fett and Luke learns a little about his family tree. Now imagine if "Empire" had ended BEFORE the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader and you get some idea of the error Jackson made here. He instead gives us a brief, anticlimactic aside to Osgilath where nothing really happens that hasn't happened before. Worst of all was Sam Gamgee turning into Sam Rockne with a "Some things are worth fighting for" speech that was so corny it made me laugh.I also felt the film didn't flow very well and could have been edited together much better. At several points in the movie I checked my watch and wondered, "I haven't seen Frodo and Sam for about 45 minutes. What the hell happened to that story?" In comparison, watch any of the "Star Wars" films and marvel at how perfectly they balance and fade to several concurrent story lines. "Towers" lacked this fluidity.Aside from these flaws, however, I greatly enjoyed "Towers." Its action sequences are unparalleled and the casting remains perfect. For pure visual flair this series sets the benchmark for everything else out there. I eagerly await "The Return of the King," which will hopefully live up to "Fellowship." The first film in this trilogy ranks a 10, but "Towers" falters slightly and falls to an 8.Score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic film making at its most spectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson has taken an `un-filmable' story and produced a true epic rich in the fantasy and myth that are inherent in the J.R.R. Tolkien books. There are naysayers out there that complain that the film doesn't follow the books ? but it does ? allowing for the vast scope and panorama of the original stories.The characters look and act exactly as I remember them from the books and the settings and scenes are far greater than what my poor imagination was ever able to conjure up. I was entirely prepared to not like this film; I was not completely sold on the first one. But Peter Jackson (director) and his wife Frances Walsh (screenwriter) have obviously poured their hearts and souls into this project ? not to mention years of their lives and the effort shows.There are so many sub-plots and interconnected stories that it is near impossible to keep them all straight ? but the tightly woven screenplay and the brilliant editing make it all work marvelously. There is not a miss-step or false note in the entire film. There were a couple of scenes that looked as if they could have been lifted right out of that other modern fairy tale: `The Wizard of Oz' but for the most part everything seemed original and fresh.Howard Shore's original score adds greatly to the overall feel of the film. It rises spectacularly at peak moments with a ?chorus of thousands' lending their talents and subsides quietly at moments of peace and tenderness.The Production Design and Art Direction (Grant Major and Peter Joe Bleakley, respectively) add to the grandeur and range that the film reaches for. The luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (not to mention the spectacular New Zealand settings) enhances the mystical and ?other-worldly' quality that the films strives for and achieves.This is a tightly woven piece of modern film making that should inspire filmmakers everywhere to strive for the best and hopefully, achieve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest story ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, computer graphics are living up to the hype of the last two decades. I gladly eat my words in the great digital vs. analog effects debate. It was pure pleasure to behold this film and not find a single fault. Then again, I've never read a word by Tolkein and only saw the beautiful Fellowship of the Ring DVD last week. Since the entire story is new to me I went in with no preconceived ideas. The film's story, settings, and characters were fantastic and the effects were perfectly integrated to serve and strengthen the tale. Obviously, the costumes, makeup, and convincingly aged sets were spectacular.*** Spoilers aheadFavorite effects: The Ring Wraith's dragon, the chained trolls pulling Mordor's gate open, and the demented king's closeup as he returned to vibrant health.Favorite moments of power and beauty: The simple, pure, dreamily slow-motion arrival of Gandalf's white horse friend. The arrival of the elves at Helm's deep. The first glimpse of the gigantic crossbow. Aragorn's dream. Everything involving the Ents, especially their boulder-throwing, orc-stomping, dam-bursting battle against Isengard.Further praise of this inspiring film is pointless, as it speaks for itself perfectly. We are lucky to live in a time where creative people can produce groundbreaking artistic landmarks of such beauty and integrity. Thank you, New Line cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOTR TTT begin`s exactly where FOTR ended. Frodo,and Sam left to take The Cursed Ring of Power to The Cracks of Mt.Doom,Legolas,Gimli,and Aragon hunting The Orc's who captured their Hobbit Companions Merry,and Pippin. The Movie doesn't really get good until The beginning of The Battle of Helm`s Deep.I feel bad Sir Ian McKellan is absent most of the movie. Gollum has some funny lines. But it is really Sam,and Frodo`s journey that makes the movie great. They are captured by Faramir (Brother of Sean Bean`s chacarter Boromir) He is certain The Evil Ring has the power to save The Country of Gondor. Frodo begin`s to lose faith. His faithful Servant Sam restore`s it. I love Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. He is truly a great character. Yet TTT is not like the novel at all. In fact my favorite part`s are taken out The Voice of Saurman,and Shelob`s Lair. Hey we can hope for that in ROTK.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As Fellowship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that on the whole I certainly did enjoy TTT. However it failed to grab and hold me in the way that Fellowship did. Perhaps it was the characters, or the long sitting time but I felt myself getting restless during the whole film and certainly noticed the three-hour sitting time unlike Fellowship. The battle at Helms Deep was by far the most impressive feature of the entire film. In fact if you take the battle away the rest is pretty unremarkable.Gollum. He was done very well. After the debacle of Jar Jar Binks in the new Star Wars films I was dreading the thought of another cgi main character. However old Gollum was a delight to watch and listen to. The character portray was just about perfect and the cgi far more impressive that Mr Lucas lame effort.Gollum was by far the most interesting character in the entire movie, he certainly had the most personality, a bit like the holographic Doctor in Star Trek Voyager. I know everyone raves about Aragorn and Legolas but I personally find them to be pretty bland individuals who get by on their brooding manner and handsome faces. They are not very gripping characters and their continual moping wears on you after a time. Merry and Pippin are far more fun to watch.As stated at the beginning I did enjoy the film but I felt it lacked the emotional impact of FOTR. There was no tear jerking moments like when Gandalf fell in Moria or the death of Boromir, it was just a big slugfest and special effects showcase. Frodo and Sam wandered about in circles most of the time and I felt a bit lost right along with them, like the film was wandering and trying to find its way. Non the less Return Of The King will hopefully put a bit of emotion back into the films and have us pulling at the heart strings like Fellowship did so well.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that I actually stayed up until midnight to see the sneak preview of this movie. It was so long and drawn out that by the time the big battle actually happened I wanted the movie to be over already. First, I would like to say that I enjoyed the first one and that I was eager to see this one. However, I was extremely disappointed. Like the relationship between Aragon and the elf chick. They made it out to be some huge deal in the second one when there wasn't much to it in the original. I'm talking about the films here so keep what you read in the books to yourself. None of the characters fit the way they were in the original, except for the elf. Aragon seemed rather lifeless. This is especially noticed in the scene where he says," Open war is upon you whether you would risk it or not." He says it so monotone that you'd think he was reading it right off the script. Frodo was insane for the entire movie. Yes, you can argue that the ring was making him that way, but at least a little of his happy old self should have still been there. The dwarf came off as a total retard in this film and was there mostly for comic relief, whereas in the original he seemed more of a serious character. The battles were much more unrealistic in this film also. 300 men + some elves are fighting 10,000 orks. Obviously the orks are winning. So the orks break through the front gate of this fortress and Aragon and the dwarf are sent out to hold them back while they blockade the front gate. Those two people manage to hold off all those orks when 300+ people can't? I find that a little hard to believe. During the whole movie they're talking about this big battle that is going to happen. Two hours later, it finally happens. This is about the time when I was falling asleep from boredom. But I decided I'd stay awake for the battle. It definately wasn't worth it. The humans lose and lose and lose as you'd expect, but then Gandolf rides up over the mountain and the battle is won. It's just pathetic and unrealistic. This movie was endlessly boring, badly acted/interpreted, and completely untrue to the original. However, I did like the elf. His part was well done and he was the only one who maintained his role properly. I also liked the part when the trees went to war. That was rather amusing.So, I recommend that you don't see this movie and just read the book instead (it's much better), and if you absolutely must see it, wait until it comes out on video as it's not worth the money to see it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes people expect a lot from "The Return o the King"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many comments from so many people, and I realized that people are not happy with the changes that Peter Jackson put it in the adaptation.The ones that actually read the "The Two Towers" could realize that between the three volumes, the second one would be the most difficult to put in a regular time-line story. They are forgetting that one of the most important tools in the book is the narrator, which is not used in the film. It is necessary learn to respect the differences between the movie and the book, otherwise, "The Fellowship" would be a completely failure as an adapted film, because they put too much from the second book in the first movie. In my opinion, the ones who loved the first film are going to love the second one, and the ones who hated "The Fellowship of The Ring" are going to hate "The Two Towers". The only real danger is the expectation for the third movie, because the ones who read "The Return of The King" are expecting a lot of perfection, and Peter Jackson cannot miss on that one.I liked this film because I simply LOVE the book. Peter Jackson is doing an extraordinary work. He knew the It would be risky to do it, and everybody knows, or should know, that it wouldn't be perfect. I think that the curriculum of all the ones involved in the "Lord of The Rings" project will be divided in before-L.R. and after-L.R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a worthy follow up to the seminal Fellowship of the Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without doubt, Peter Jackson has once again done justice to Tolkien's staggering literary achievement. This film, though much, much darker in tone than Fellowship, delivers the depth and breadth of the novel in dramatic and engrossing fashion.Although several portions of the book have been either omitted or amended for the silver screen, the story does not suffer in any way. Fans of the book may be disappointed that the Ents received short shrift, but when viewed through the average cinema goers eyes (i.e. one that has not had the benefit of reading the book)even the most ardent LOTR fan must agree that the changes made sense. Several characters enjoy more screen time, notably Gimli, who provides comic relief at times when the on screen drama demands it. My highlight was the image of the Ents descending on Isengard. CGI has never seemed more appealing.I for one will be counting down the days to "The Return of The king". I will also be keeping my fingers crossed that certain elements of that particular book make the final cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but really nothing much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read The Hobbit when I was very young and it was truly magical. Read Lord of the Rings a couple of times in my teens and it was wonderful. Saw the first film a few months ago in my late thirties and found it surprisingly entertaining. Waited eagerly for the this latest instalment and walked away disappointed.Why? Well, look again at the first film. It has magic, it has wit, it has charm, it has wonder. Simply put, from the charm and wit of the Shire and Bilbo Baggins, to the magic of the Elves and the wonder of those great statues (erect and fallen) as we enter Gondor, the film places us very firmly in Middle Earth.In this new film, wit seems to consist of poor "jokes" regarding Gimli's lack of height and Legolas speeding down a concrete staircase on a skateboard. Is this funny? The charm and sense of wonder has completely gone, and the magic that could (and should) have been created in the dark and mysterious forest of Fangorn has been replaced instead by a very amateurish rendering of the Ents. More than 10 years ago Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs convincingly to life, so what on earth has happened here with Treebeard and co.?Most sadly of all, I didn't once feel like I was in Middle Earth. To me, those panoramic background shots seemed all too often to be more the work of The New Zealand Tourist Authority than anything which Tolkien had conceived.Gollum, of course, WAS good, but isn't a little tragic when a movie's best and most three dimensional character is the result of a computer?I still look forward to the next episode, but whatever happens I know now that I can always console myself with one simple truth. While Jackson and Hollywood may destroy the movie, no one will ever be able to destroy the book(s).May generations of youngsters to come continue to read these works and find in them the feelings of magic and wonder which I too did all those years ago!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we are witnessing here, with these three films as one, is the culmination of a century of craft and developed artistry. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is what Meille and the Lumiere brothers began, what Griffith, Chaplin, Eisenstein, and others developed, what Welles perfected and then lost, what Kurasawa imagined all on his own, what Coppola saw through his madness... all these paths and so many others, channeling their technique and ambition down through time to Peter Jackson...I honestly feel that it's downhill for cinema from here... this is the high point and a new artform, perhaps a form of electronic entertainment will now replace cinema as the artform of our time. This is the greatest work of fiction I will ever read in my lifetime, transformed through technology both young and old into the greatest movie experience i've ever had... and i've had some great ones.The Greatest Movies of All Time.</fullReview>

It was a solid cramming of 3.5 hours of 'events', that didn't necessarily improve the quality of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Trying to maintain an impossible balance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the first movie, FOTR, I thought Tolkien's LOTR was impossible to adapt to film. It has so many strong characters and such a rich, multithreaded plot that I couldn't imagine how anyone could make all these people and ideas come to the screen without heavily watering down many of the details and characters. Somehow in FOTR Jackson maintained Tolkien's richness of story and characters with only minor changes. Jackson maintained an impossible balance of all Tolkien's detail to appeal to the Tolkien read as well as the unread viewer. In TTT, the big question for me was whether or not he would be able to maintain this 'impossible balance' as the story continued.THE MOVIE - TTT ***Some minor Spoilers***.The re-introductions to the FOTR characters and introductions to new characters was setup well. Gandalf's battle with the Balrog continues and Gandalf's return is explained in a great yet vague manner consistent with the book. Frodo, Sam and Gollum together worked for me. Gollum's schizophrenic scenes were believable and even comic (if a little overlong) at times. Merry and Pippin were more serious and no longer the comic relief duo, but any comic responsibility they shed was picked up many times over by Gimli. I'm sure he had more comic lines than serious ones. Aragorn and Legolas will again have their fan followings either for their battle prowess, or their lady swooning abilities. Saruman was back in a lesser role with his army of badies. We were also introduced to King Théoden, Wormtongue, Eomer and Eowyn in the first hour of the movie, so the beginning laid a solid foundation for the rest of the story.I first got a sinking feeling that something was really missing when the Uruk-hai fought over Merry and Pippin. There was no division of ranks between the forces of Mordor and Isengard. Nor was there the counterplot in which Saruman had designs on keeping the ring for himself. Later, I again experienced this feeling of something missing when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli met Eomer and the Riders of Rohan on the plain. Many of Tolkien's subtleties of that meeting were missing, and I could see that there was not going to be a brother-like bond between Aragorn and Eomer.Merry and Pippin's escape from the Uruk-hai interleaved with Aragorn discovering the clues of their escape was well done. This sequence lead up to the introduction of Treebeard. I'm sure that there will be many who pick apart the CGI in these scenes, but I give top marks to Jackson et al. for being brave enough to include a force of walking, talking, fighting trees in the movie. My problem with the Ents was not with the effects, but rather it felt that Jackson was struggling to stay consistent with Tolkien. Jackson kept them very true to the book and 'unhasty' in some scenes then had them act in the opposite manner in the next scenes. Also, for one of the oldest, wisest creatures in Middle earth, Treebeard was more than a little naive. He acknowledges the smoke over Isengard, but failed to deduce than smoke means fire, fire mean wood, and wood means... (wait for it) ...TREES. Further, the overall significance of the Ents overthrowing Isengard was not clear, but there is (hopefully) room for exposition on that in the next movie.Théoden's transformation back to himself was nicely done, but it didn't seem very logical that Grima was spared and set free given the knowledge he had of Rohan's defenses. This is perhaps another riddle to be answered in the next movie. The flight to Helmsdeep was good with a little of everything: comedy, romance (via Aragorn / Arwen flashback), and a battle.Frodo, Sam and Gollum's journey introduced us to the flying Nazgul, and gave us glimpses of the mental turmoil the ring was causing for Frodo. We also got our first look at the impressive, impenetrable fortress of Mordor and of Sauron's massing armies. I thought Jackson did well to stay somewhat true to the book as Frodo, Sam and Gollum watched Faramir's ambush of the Oliphant riding Wildmen and during Frodo and Sam's capture, but struggled with Tolkien consistency in subsequent scenes. For the next few scenes I thought their whole interaction disappointing. There was no sense of mutual respect between Frodo and Faramir. When Faramir 'showed his worth' by declaring that the ring would go to Gondor, I felt my eyes bulge in my head.The Helmsdeep arrival and battle preparation sequence was OK. The whole pacing of the movie seemed rushed here. Why did they have to try to make so much happen in one day? Between the arrival at Helmsdeep, the battle preparation, the tension building moments, the comic relief moments, the arrival of reinforcements combined with scenes of the simultaneous doings of Saruman, Aragorn, Merry and Pippin - whew!...keeping track of everything was a bit difficult to follow. Also, as an aside, what were those Hobbit children doing in Helmsdeep? - grin.The battle of Helmsdeep itself was excellent with bad moments. On the good side, the scope was immense and the effects very good. Ten thousand enemies assaulting a fortified stronghold. There was an outer wall battle, an inner wall battle, and last stand at the gate - wave after wave of attack and counter attack. On the bad side, a few unbelievables that stood out for me: For example, Aragorn being blown off the outer wall to the courtyard in a massive explosion then getting up, uninjured, a few seconds later, or the scene where Aragorn and Gimli attacked everyone on the ramp then get pulled to safety by a dangling rope. Gandalf's arrival with Eomer was good but their initial charge looked to be a poor battle tactic - charging downhill into a pike holding mass. Another minor criticism for me was that King Théoden doesn't come across as very noble - quite inferior to Tolkien's Théoden.The battle with Faramir's people in Osgiliath served no purpose. OK, reading a bit into it, we see that Faramir is the only one brave enough to raise a weapon to the flying Nazgul. But after Frodo's scene with the Nazgul Faramir comes to understand what Frodo is going through and decides to set him free after all. HUH!?!?!? What insight has he had? How could he possibly understand Frodo's situation and turmoil? Did Sam's speech win him over? This did not flow for me at all. Perhaps Jackson et al. wanted to include another battle using Sauron's forces to show that more evil forces were at work than only Saruman (? - I don't know.).Overall, it didn't seem as though there were as many subtle scenes , or as many scenes with hidden significance in TTT as there were in FOTR. In the end we were left in similar circumstances to what we were in FOTR. While TTT still has the flavour of Tolkien's LOTR, the full essence of Tolkien's great work is not as strong as it was in the FOTR. There are so many things happening in the movie that I think the unread viewer will have problems following the 'why' behind all that is happening. But, by the same token, once you've read the book you can't help but to compare it to the movie and here TTT fails to achieve the same impossible balance that FOTR achieved.My $0.02.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Filmaking at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers should not be considered as a sequel to the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the three-hour second act, with the upcoming Return of the King being the three-hour third act. That said, knowing what happened in the first film is necessary to understanding almost everything in the second film. I have read the Lord of the Rings books, and I was not disappointed that certain things were cut out of the first film. However, I was a little upset with a few of the changes that Jackson made in The Two Towers, notably the exclusion of the giant spider Shelob, which will apparently make it into Return of the King. Also, the order in which things happened in the books are not all similar to how they happen in the movie, and the back-and-forth editing hurt the flow of the film and consequently made things feel awkward. As a movie alone, however, The Two Towers is nothing but fantastic. Jackson's direction is quite skillful, especially at the much-revered Helm's Deep scene, which features the greatest "silence before the violence" moment EVER. The visuals certainly have outdone the first film in almost every way, mostly thanks to the CGI creature Gollum, who looks so very real. The acting was on par with Fellowship, but it could have been better if Gandalf and Saruman had bigger roles and more lines.  A few things I was let down by were the sets and locations, which seemed a lot less inspired than in the first film; the writing, which strayed a bit TOO far from the books; and the musical score, which wasn't bad, but wasn't as great as the Fellowship score. The only other thing that bothered me was the lighting. I had hoped the Two Towers would have been darker, but much of it took place in the daytime. Even so, these small flaws could in no way bring down such a marvelous epic as this.

		<shortDescription>Finally, The Bar Is Raised The Competition Is On.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's taken a while but finally Peter Jackson has taken Hollywood by storm and actually shown them how to deliver an entertaining movie that keeps the storyline in tact and visualises the mastery, mysticism and grandeur that is J.R.R. Tolkien.Gollum is nothing short of Breathtaking. The Academy need to add a new Acting Award to the Oscars in the very near future. Best Performace by a Digital Character. Gollum's presence in the film was felt in a way only human actors can deliver. "Weta Effects" should be proud of their skills and talents in bringing Numbers together on a PC to give life to a character that makes the human audience Laugh, Cry and Feel Compassion.Although the movie was slow in places overall it was a great film. 9/10 is an accurate score.On a difference note, my Friend &amp; I do have a question to ask either Peter Jackson (Screenplay) or Mr. Tolkien's estate (Novel). Q: If Saruman has the technology for his troops to fire large crossbow catapults over the walls. Why then didn't they just simply fasten the gunpowder bombs to them and fire them over the wall. Seems it would have been smarter to do that then have an Orc run up to the castle carrying the Bomb.Also in an earlier scene, Saruman let's Wormtongue know he has stumbled upon this new form of Weaponry. Wormtongue brings the candle closer to the gunpowder (Secret Weapon) and Saruman fends him off for obvious reasons. If this secret weapon "GUNPOWDER" is so secret or such a new threat to the kingdom of man, then why did Gandalf have a wagon full of Fireworks for all to see in the Hobbiton Shire. If Saruman was as clever as he looks don't ya think he would have invented the Gun. Even the Chinese used rockets in war when they discovered that Fireworks could be fired in a certain direction. Look at Mulan. I guess Saruman... I mean Christopher Lee is overworked from his appearances in two of the biggest franchises in Hollywood History. Hey I know maybe Christopher could take over the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who complain about the movie deviating from the book -- you obviously do not understand anything about writing AND movie making. And you do not understand the differences between the two media: books and films. You must be the same people who said "Gone With The Wind," one of the most beloved films of all time, sucks because it was different from the book...This movie is magnificent. Some of my friends are not fantasy fans but they enjoyed the movie and would very much like to see ROTK. That must mean something. This movie is epic movie making at its best. The battle at Helms Deep is more incredible than anything we have seen so far -- not even Braveheart, which won the 1995 Best Picture. The performances are outstanding all around, and that is quite an achievement for an ensemble this size. The visuals are fantastic, albeit some minor flaws. And Gollum is one hell of a character -- truly groundbreaking.It is not to say this movie is perfect. Nothing is. I for one couldn't quite get into the plot with the Ents (I guess it was a little too "Never Ending Story" for me). But this is definitely movie making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some "reviewers" revel in their power-tripping anonymity of the internet, all I have to say that TTT is a more than worthy second part to this so-far amazing trilogy. Having read the trilogy many times over the last 25 years, I appreciate both the written word of Tokien, and the screen interpretation/adaptation of Jackson. As many comments indicated, Jackson preserved the spirit of LOTR, as he necessarily adapted the story for the screen. Gollum/Smeagal is an amazing achievement in CGI, and Serkis's portrayal deserves to be recognized. The "romance" of LOTR is in the epic itself, as the characters are but pawns being pushed and pulled by the circumstances and dynamics of the greater story. LOTR is not a Harry Potter story that is so simple that it can be adapted word for word onto the screen. There needed to be some manipulation to fit the story onto the screen, and in 3 parts that made sense visually, and in its continuity of the story. All told, a wonderful job by Jackson and his team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only caveat I have about this film is: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SEEING THIS ONE UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. There is absolutely no "things that occurred up to now" in this film. It simply takes off where the first one left off. So unless you've seen the first, you'd be lost in this film. I think that was a mistake. There are approximately 38 people on the face of the earth who didn't see the first film and they wouldn't have a clue as to what it's all about. There's no explanation as to why the Hobbits left the Shire, why they're going to Mordor or what power the ring has. However, as one who has seen the first (many times) and read the books (many times), I can say this film was MAGNIFICENTLY done. Jackson has another great film to his credit, although this one had to have been very difficult to design, plan and film. Much of this is due to the way the books were written. The film would require significant adaption and revision. It simply couldn't be filmed as it was written. See the first one, then see this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two down, one to go.The middle part of a story is often the weakest - sort of an interim between the highs on either side (witness "24," "Murder One," "Twin Peaks" etc). "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" does qualify, but it's only inferior to "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" in the same way that drinking is inferior to imbibing.The previous movie had the principals more or less united, with the storyline similarly concentrated; this time, with the main characters all over Middle Earth, the movie's a bit episodic at times and is also guilty of making Gimli into something of a comic relief character (and as for him and Legolas boasting about how many people they kill...). But it gradually hooks you in the same way the last one did, and there are ultimately plenty of reasons for you to continue the journey.1. Ian McKellen; Bernard Hill; Viggo Mortensen; Christopher Lee; John Rhys-Davies; Sean Astin; Andy Serkis (unforgettable as Gollum); Elijah Wood; Miranda Otto; Liv Tyler (basically in an extended cameo, but Liv is always welcome)... basically everyone except Cate Blanchett. And even here she's blessedly kept to the absolute minimum.2. The building up of the characters, even the other two hobbits.3. Peter Jackson's Tim Burton-esque ability to bring to the screen some images that sound laughable when talking about them (ambulatory trees that can talk) and realise them with conviction.4. Stunning special effects and battle scenes that stir you both artistically and emotionally.5. Howard Shore's truly striking music.6. The fact that you end up wanting the movie to go on for another three hours.And come Christmas 2003, it will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has left me in an awkward frame of mind. I don't know whether I want to sing Peter Jackson's praises to the world or mutter coarse and vulgar things about him under my breath.I am an unabashed and lifelong Lord of the Rings nut. I have read the books more times than I can remember. If you give me the name of the most obscure character, I can probably tell you all about him or her. If you read me a line from one of the books, I can probably tell you which book and chapter it is from, as well as it's context.I am also an avid film buff and understand perfectly well that a film-maker has to paraphrase, compress, and otherwise alter a book in order to fit it into a viable film. I think Peter Jackson did a masterful job of this with the Fellowship of the Ring, and I looked forward to a similar, if not even more faithful rendition of the Two Towers. After all, the story lines in the Two Towers (book) are fairly straightforward, though on multiple paths.So I was quite taken aback by the extent to which Jackson has taken liberties with the story line in this film. Several major deviations he made seem unnecessary and unforgivable to me, though others do make sense for the reasons given above. I ought to have been furious about this, perhaps even to the point of walking out of the film. But I wasn't, and here is why: it is just too good a movie not to like.The cast and performance are superb. The portrayal of Gollum is beyond all my expectations, and the Ents are quite good as well. The visuals are as breathtaking as they were in the first film. And, as with the Fellowship of the Ring, I was so immersed in the film that I had no sense of it's length.So if, like me, you have practically memorized Tolkien's work, do see the film. If you can check your knowledge of the books at the theater entrance, you will enjoy the film for what it is. If you cannot, you will at least have a wealth of material for conversation. In either case, you will have a whole year to speculate about what PJ will do with, or to, the Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying to maintain an impossible balance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the first movie, FOTR, I thought Tolkien's LOTR was impossible to adapt to film. It has so many strong characters and such a rich, multithreaded plot that I couldn't imagine how anyone could make all these people and ideas come to the screen without heavily watering down many of the details and characters. Somehow in FOTR Jackson maintained Tolkien's richness of story and characters with only minor changes. Jackson maintained an impossible balance of all Tolkien's detail to appeal to the Tolkien read as well as the unread viewer. In TTT, the big question for me was whether or not he would be able to maintain this 'impossible balance' as the story continued.THE MOVIE - TTT ***Some minor Spoilers***.The re-introductions to the FOTR characters and introductions to new characters was setup well. Gandalf's battle with the Balrog continues and Gandalf's return is explained in a great yet vague manner consistent with the book. Frodo, Sam and Gollum together worked for me. Gollum's schizophrenic scenes were believable and even comic (if a little overlong) at times. Merry and Pippin were more serious and no longer the comic relief duo, but any comic responsibility they shed was picked up many times over by Gimli. I'm sure he had more comic lines than serious ones. Aragorn and Legolas will again have their fan followings either for their battle prowess, or their lady swooning abilities. Saruman was back in a lesser role with his army of badies. We were also introduced to King Théoden, Wormtongue, Eomer and Eowyn in the first hour of the movie, so the beginning laid a solid foundation for the rest of the story.I first got a sinking feeling that something was really missing when the Uruk-hai fought over Merry and Pippin. There was no division of ranks between the forces of Mordor and Isengard. Nor was there the counterplot in which Saruman had designs on keeping the ring for himself. Later, I again experienced this feeling of something missing when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli met Eomer and the Riders of Rohan on the plain. Many of Tolkien's subtleties of that meeting were missing, and I could see that there was not going to be a brother-like bond between Aragorn and Eomer.Merry and Pippin's escape from the Uruk-hai interleaved with Aragorn discovering the clues of their escape was well done. This sequence lead up to the introduction of Treebeard. I'm sure that there will be many who pick apart the CGI in these scenes, but I give top marks to Jackson et al. for being brave enough to include a force of walking, talking, fighting trees in the movie. My problem with the Ents was not with the effects, but rather it felt that Jackson was struggling to stay consistent with Tolkien. Jackson kept them very true to the book and 'unhasty' in some scenes then had them act in the opposite manner in the next scenes. Also, for one of the oldest, wisest creatures in Middle earth, Treebeard was more than a little naive. He acknowledges the smoke over Isengard, but failed to deduce than smoke means fire, fire mean wood, and wood means... (wait for it) ...TREES. Further, the overall significance of the Ents overthrowing Isengard was not clear, but there is (hopefully) room for exposition on that in the next movie.Théoden's transformation back to himself was nicely done, but it didn't seem very logical that Grima was spared and set free given the knowledge he had of Rohan's defenses. This is perhaps another riddle to be answered in the next movie. The flight to Helmsdeep was good with a little of everything: comedy, romance (via Aragorn / Arwen flashback), and a battle.Frodo, Sam and Gollum's journey introduced us to the flying Nazgul, and gave us glimpses of the mental turmoil the ring was causing for Frodo. We also got our first look at the impressive, impenetrable fortress of Mordor and of Sauron's massing armies. I thought Jackson did well to stay somewhat true to the book as Frodo, Sam and Gollum watched Faramir's ambush of the Oliphant riding Wildmen and during Frodo and Sam's capture, but struggled with Tolkien consistency in subsequent scenes. For the next few scenes I thought their whole interaction disappointing. There was no sense of mutual respect between Frodo and Faramir. When Faramir 'showed his worth' by declaring that the ring would go to Gondor, I felt my eyes bulge in my head.The Helmsdeep arrival and battle preparation sequence was OK. The whole pacing of the movie seemed rushed here. Why did they have to try to make so much happen in one day? Between the arrival at Helmsdeep, the battle preparation, the tension building moments, the comic relief moments, the arrival of reinforcements combined with scenes of the simultaneous doings of Saruman, Aragorn, Merry and Pippin - whew!...keeping track of everything was a bit difficult to follow. Also, as an aside, what were those Hobbit children doing in Helmsdeep? - grin.The battle of Helmsdeep itself was excellent with bad moments. On the good side, the scope was immense and the effects very good. Ten thousand enemies assaulting a fortified stronghold. There was an outer wall battle, an inner wall battle, and last stand at the gate - wave after wave of attack and counter attack. On the bad side, a few unbelievables that stood out for me: For example, Aragorn being blown off the outer wall to the courtyard in a massive explosion then getting up, uninjured, a few seconds later, or the scene where Aragorn and Gimli attacked everyone on the ramp then get pulled to safety by a dangling rope. Gandalf's arrival with Eomer was good but their initial charge looked to be a poor battle tactic - charging downhill into a pike holding mass. Another minor criticism for me was that King Théoden doesn't come across as very noble - quite inferior to Tolkien's Théoden.The battle with Faramir's people in Osgiliath served no purpose. OK, reading a bit into it, we see that Faramir is the only one brave enough to raise a weapon to the flying Nazgul. But after Frodo's scene with the Nazgul Faramir comes to understand what Frodo is going through and decides to set him free after all. HUH!?!?!? What insight has he had? How could he possibly understand Frodo's situation and turmoil? Did Sam's speech win him over? This did not flow for me at all. Perhaps Jackson et al. wanted to include another battle using Sauron's forces to show that more evil forces were at work than only Saruman (? - I don't know.).Overall, it didn't seem as though there were as many subtle scenes , or as many scenes with hidden significance in TTT as there were in FOTR. In the end we were left in similar circumstances to what we were in FOTR. While TTT still has the flavour of Tolkien's LOTR, the full essence of Tolkien's great work is not as strong as it was in the FOTR. There are so many things happening in the movie that I think the unread viewer will have problems following the 'why' behind all that is happening. But, by the same token, once you've read the book you can't help but to compare it to the movie and here TTT fails to achieve the same impossible balance that FOTR achieved.My $0.02.</fullReview>

No I'm afraid that these films are not that original - but modern technology enables them to be so well made they are genuinely spectacular. Characterisation of the human actors is a little poor and with the alarming theme of people being killed and then returning to life - you don't really care if they might be the one who doesn't last the movie! However, my 14 year old son, as with the first film, thought it was fantastic so that merits it an 8 out of 10 especially at three hours. I warn you however, that my wife - a literary fan - fell to sleep occasionally so not all your companions will necessarily be satisfied with the evening out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers: A Good Film, just not Tolkien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat in the theatre, watching the Two Towers, I was remarkably disappointed. Characters I've cherished all through my life were sacrificed at the altar of special effects and added story. Frodo, a noble and wise character, is painted as a hapless hobbit on a doomed journey. Elijah Wood fails in his portrayal by relying almost soley on his always wet eyes. But what really bothers me is the lack of dialog that was provided by Tolkien.In the book, Faramir is a stark contrast to brother Boromir. Faramir harkens back to the kings of old with a noble streak nearly as immense as that of Aragorn. He states that even if he found Isildur's Bane on the side of the road, he would not take it....and then discovers that he must live up to those words. In the book, Faramir releases Frodo to continue his journey, though it pains him to do so. Not because he wants the Ring, but because the journey is perilous and he would spare his friend the sorrow. But in the movie, Faramir is painted as a lesser version of Boromir, a man who takes Frodo and Sam by force away from their path and only later realizes that they must be released.Add to that, Jackson has decided that a love triangle must exist. Arwen's role in Two Towers is increased and Eowyn, a noble warrior in her own right, is turned into a woman who pines after Aragorn.There is so much in the books that clearly cannot be translated to the screen as there is simply not enough time. I am forced to wonder why so many elements were added. Was the original source not interesting enough?As I sat in the movie theatre, watching the story I've read countless times since I was 11, I remember being shocked and appalled that I had no idea what was going to happen next. The movie had strayed so far from the book as to have created an entirely new tale. Gimli became Comic Relief, and the growing friendship between the Elf and the Dwarf was barely demonstrated. Jackson completely reversed the outcome of Entmoot.Things I liked: Gollum. Andy did an absolutely amazing job with that character. The cleansing of Isengard was also quite spectacular.It's a good film. The effects are amazing and New Zealand is beautiful.

It's gonna be a long wait. :) I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I watched the movie. I've never read the book before, but I'm reading it now and love it!

		<shortDescription>Star Trek with Hobbits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found The Two Towers to be a little disappointing. This episode seems to have gotten the Star Trek movie bug. That is, too much of it consists of characters standing in shadow declaiming in pseudo-Shakespearean language about some deep thing or another. I found whole sections of the film to be quite boring and devoid of interest. Quite different from The Fellowship of the Ring, which was a rollercoaster from start to finish.On the plus side, Gollum was great. Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Michael Jackson? The battle of Helms Deep was very also very cool. I also liked the tinkering with the plot, particularly where Faramir is concerned, because their alteration actually made more sense than the original.The Ents of course are ridiculous, but then that's Tolkein's fault, not Peter Jackson's. The more accurately Jackson renders them, the more laughable they are. Oh well.I'm looking forward to THe Return of the King, and hope Jackson et al. have gotten cured of the Patrick Stewart speech flu by the time they finish editing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i thought it was a comic---was i wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago my 12 year old son raved to the family about LOTR, and spoke incessantly of Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf, Middle Earth Etc. To me it sounded like a serialised comic strip, and i paid no heed to it. 19 years later i was given The Fellowship in DVD, and sat down to watch. Three hours later i was totally hooked, and i still haven't read the book. I was counting the days until the release of TTT. it was way above my expectations. From the incredibly cinematography, and endearing cast, to the cgi of Gollum (amazing), it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of all time 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has left me in an awkward frame of mind. I don't know whether I want to sing Peter Jackson's praises to the world or mutter coarse and vulgar things about him under my breath.I am an unabashed and lifelong Lord of the Rings nut. I have read the books more times than I can remember. If you give me the name of the most obscure character, I can probably tell you all about him or her. If you read me a line from one of the books, I can probably tell you which book and chapter it is from, as well as it's context.I am also an avid film buff and understand perfectly well that a film-maker has to paraphrase, compress, and otherwise alter a book in order to fit it into a viable film. I think Peter Jackson did a masterful job of this with the Fellowship of the Ring, and I looked forward to a similar, if not even more faithful rendition of the Two Towers. After all, the story lines in the Two Towers (book) are fairly straightforward, though on multiple paths.So I was quite taken aback by the extent to which Jackson has taken liberties with the story line in this film. Several major deviations he made seem unnecessary and unforgivable to me, though others do make sense for the reasons given above. I ought to have been furious about this, perhaps even to the point of walking out of the film. But I wasn't, and here is why: it is just too good a movie not to like.The cast and performance are superb. The portrayal of Gollum is beyond all my expectations, and the Ents are quite good as well. The visuals are as breathtaking as they were in the first film. And, as with the Fellowship of the Ring, I was so immersed in the film that I had no sense of it's length.So if, like me, you have practically memorized Tolkien's work, do see the film. If you can check your knowledge of the books at the theater entrance, you will enjoy the film for what it is. If you cannot, you will at least have a wealth of material for conversation. In either case, you will have a whole year to speculate about what PJ will do with, or to, the Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers: A Good Film, just not Tolkien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat in the theatre, watching the Two Towers, I was remarkably disappointed. Characters I've cherished all through my life were sacrificed at the altar of special effects and added story. Frodo, a noble and wise character, is painted as a hapless hobbit on a doomed journey. Elijah Wood fails in his portrayal by relying almost soley on his always wet eyes. But what really bothers me is the lack of dialog that was provided by Tolkien.In the book, Faramir is a stark contrast to brother Boromir. Faramir harkens back to the kings of old with a noble streak nearly as immense as that of Aragorn. He states that even if he found Isildur's Bane on the side of the road, he would not take it....and then discovers that he must live up to those words. In the book, Faramir releases Frodo to continue his journey, though it pains him to do so. Not because he wants the Ring, but because the journey is perilous and he would spare his friend the sorrow. But in the movie, Faramir is painted as a lesser version of Boromir, a man who takes Frodo and Sam by force away from their path and only later realizes that they must be released.Add to that, Jackson has decided that a love triangle must exist. Arwen's role in Two Towers is increased and Eowyn, a noble warrior in her own right, is turned into a woman who pines after Aragorn.There is so much in the books that clearly cannot be translated to the screen as there is simply not enough time. I am forced to wonder why so many elements were added. Was the original source not interesting enough?As I sat in the movie theatre, watching the story I've read countless times since I was 11, I remember being shocked and appalled that I had no idea what was going to happen next. The movie had strayed so far from the book as to have created an entirely new tale. Gimli became Comic Relief, and the growing friendship between the Elf and the Dwarf was barely demonstrated. Jackson completely reversed the outcome of Entmoot.Things I liked: Gollum. Andy did an absolutely amazing job with that character. The cleansing of Isengard was also quite spectacular.It's a good film. The effects are amazing and New Zealand is beautiful. The artistry and direction was good.But this isn't the Two Towers that I've read before. Simply put, it is not Tolkien's story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much as I anticipated the release of the Two Towers, i was very much disappointed with the plotholes and additions to the storyline.I am aware that the inclusion of Arwen was to attract more males to see the film, although I'm sure the battle scenes in the advert alone drew thousands to their nearest cinema. She has no part in the book, and her leaving for Valinor was a load of tripe. This never happened! No elven army arrived at Helm's Deep, the Ents DID decide to attack Isengard, and Haldir is not from Rivendell. The performance of Sean Astin was good, his speech about the need to pursue good was tear-inducing, but the hints of a more than friendly relationship are particularly annoying. Both Elijah Wood and Sean Astin played the parts well, all the actors played parts well, but it is the scripts i have a bone to pick with. I loved the portrayal of the riders of Rohan, just as i imagined them, with music to match the fantastic architecture and wardrobe. Brad Dourif was brilliant as Wormtongue, he was perfectly evil and slimy just as Tolkien portrays. i was delighted with Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum, and even more so when he sung his song in the forbidden pool. I loved the costumes, the score and the battle scenes, but one character in particular i have to demean. Gimli is shown as a comic, when of course in Middle Earth, he was a warrior. And to finish, i will critisize the ending. I expected a cliffhanger, as the one in the book, yet i was given a mention of 'she' who of course is mentioned much earlier in the book. Many viewers overlooked the pronoun, and presumed that Gollum was referring to his precious self, or as some of my companions cared to put it, his 'schiz self' but he was speaking of the creature which he leads the hobbits to to conclude the two towers as a book.It is a habit of mine to critisize so that when others do this, i am prepared and don't just leap to the films defence. I was very pleased with the two towers, save for the mentioned mistakes and disappointments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fantasy/adventure movie, small missteps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers after first paragraph* (Although how much you could spoil a fifty year old book I am not sure)I saw Fellowship last year and was absolutely blown away. I hadn't read Tolkien since Jr. High, but it captured everything I liked about the books and even highlighted and expanded some of the central themes. For me, Fellowship of the Ring was one of the best movies ever made--I saw Beautiful Mind once and thought it was nice, but I have watched Fellowship over and over and I am still moved by it. Like many of you, I reread the Lord of the Rings and eagerly looked forward to The Two Towers.Reading the books may have been a mistake in terms of enjoying the movie. When the book is fresh on your mind, everything that is different from the novel jars you and inhibits your ability to relax and take in the film. For example, I was anticipating the climactic battle with Shelob and I started getting anxious as I realized the film was going in a completely different direction. My main questions/gripes: 1) Tolkien's relationship with nature is one of the hallmarks of his work and I felt that Jackson unnecessarily minimized the Ents by making them appear foolishly out of touch with nature. What was gained by having Merry trick Treebeard instead of having Treebeard come to his own conclusions based on his supernatural relationship with Fanghorn forest and the damaged being caused it by Sauruman. 2)Frodo wandering up to the Ringwraith and holding up the ring made no sense--why did the Wraith just fly around aimlessly once it had seen the Ring? Was it scared of the way Sam knocked Frodo down the stairs and it feared it would suffer the same fate? Frodo and Sam had time for a nice conversation, but the Wraith was somehow unable to just fly down and pick them up. 3)Farimir quickly deciding to free both of them and their potential weapon with little obvious reason for doing so. I can't see how any of these changes helped the movie--please e-mail me if you have insights.However, these gripes all stem from a jarring of expectations set up by the book. Otherwise, I thought the character of Aragorn in particular was nicely portrayed, and the battle scenes were superb. Gollum surpassed expectations. This movie also caught the same Shakespearian themes introduced in the first one--we all suffer from greed, lust for power, and jealousy, but the most common person can stand up to the greatest human foibles.I will be looking forward to next December for the scene with Shelob--and I hope Jackson slows down the pace a bit for more reflective scenes that made Fellowship such a great movie. Fellowship rated a perfect 10--the Two Towers gets an 8.5 or 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I loved it, best film of the year for me (it hasnt been a great year, mind) but definetly flawed...the good points of the film have been mentioned extensively in the preceeding reviews, so Ill just get a bit nit-picky, if thats alright. Theres a few SPOILERS here and there, but come on, youve seen it already.It seems bloody long...seems longer than FOTR, i think because so much goes on, its exhausting. Plus the editing is a bit mad. I would have much preferred to see less of treebeard meandering around mumbling and more of M + P in the hands of the sarf london orcs.Helms deep... after all the hype. I heard a lot about it before i saw it, heard comparisons to gladiator and Braveheart...rubbish. I found it tedious, and for one reason. THERE IS NO DANGER. Our heroes are utterly invulnerable. They wave their weapons and a dozen uruk-hai are stuck dead immediately. Haldir buys the farm...well, excuse me while i roll sobbing into a grief stricken ball. Hes a bloody extra with about 4 lines of dialogue (over two films!) There is no loss...no sense of menace...I was horrified to hear the "counting game" from the book was included...pass the sick bag vicar. Legolas and gimli might as well have whipped out their respective Elf and dwarf-hoods and started measuring..."Hah, what say you to that, master elf? See? three and a half, no, three and three quarter inches!""Alas, good gimli...behold...Five inches, forsooth.""(grumble)well...tis cold..."Its utterly crass. And this isnt a issue of suspension of disbelief either. When the heroes are going through the motions - parry-kill, parry-kill, fancy move, parry-kill, surf down steps -ITS NOT EXCITING. ITS...VERY...BORING. You might as well watch arnie in "Commando". By the time the battle was half way over i was actively rooting for the uruk-hai.And as for the end...the heroes on horseback charging through the swarms of orcs like a vaguely inconvenient black fog, the rohirrim charging downhill onto a forest of spears (wouldnt that have resulted in about 2,000 horse kebabs? Or did Gandalf turn all the spears to rubber?) Even my 10 year old nephew thought the end was "dumb".Shouldnt the second film in a trilogy like this end of a note of despair, loss, tragedy? I just wish PJ gone the whole hog and thinned out the overlarge cast a bit more. Killing off Eomer and legolas at helms deep would have impressed. And if i were PJ, i wouldnt worry about upsetting the hardcore tolkien fans either...theyll always be moaning about something.</fullReview>

This one is, as the voting statistics indicate, more targeted at a women's audience. Good looking blokes roaming the countryside... In my humble opinion this episode has less diversity than the first part. Especially the first two hours couldn't thrill me apart from the, again, stunning scenery.Well, still, check this one out, be it only for the amazing special effects, a expert-level training in horse-mounting and especially Gollem and our good friend Gimli (the dwarf) who is extraordinarily funny in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(spoiler alert) a film flawed for being too short!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, I am a Tolkien fan that has enjoyed the books and associated art for years. I never thought anyone could possibly put this material on the big screen without butchering it so much it would not have the same magic.Peter Jackson has proved me so wrong, watching the Fellowship (about 30 times now!) and The Two Towers three times I feel I have been transported into Middle Earth in all its glory! Yes, I know the films have missed bits of the book out (Tom Bambardil for instance), enhanced some characters (Arwin being a good example, but seeing more of Liv Tyler is not a bad thing), changed dialogue (everyone I would say) and have characters appear where they shouldn't be (Sam and Frodo at osgiliath for instance). I agree with peter Jackson that it was necessary to change things around for the sake of making the movies as entertaining as possible whilst keeping as much of the essence of the book as possible. Therefore, i forgive Peter for all of the changes he has done, in fact he has even improved it in some places like the elves turning up to fight at Helms Deep, superb moment.After the disaster of the cgi created character Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I, I was really worried Gollum and Treebeard in The Two Towers. I was astonished with the realism of Gollum, I forgot he was cgi'd when I was watching him which is the ultimate test i would say. Treebeard was well done as well, would have liked to have seen more of him espiecially in his Ent house, hopefully we will see more on the extended DVD I am expecting late next year.One question, how did Aragorn manage to put his sword back into its sheath when he fell off the cliff? Is there a break in continuity here?Getting Alan Lee and John Howe involved in the artwork for the film was a master stroke, so many scenes looked just as if they had been lifted straight from their paintings.Well done to all those that worked on the film, but particulary Peter Jackson, he is a genius. Can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Story, Sub-par Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will make my comments away from the film's story but about the film's directing. We all know that the LOTR has one of the most powerful stories ever in the media (including literature). I've never read the novels but still very much enjoy the story on film. However, I can only imagine what the film would be like if it had a better director. My opinion of "The Two Towers" is the same as "The Fellowship of the Ring". Both films are driven by story. I enjoyed both films extremely only because of the stories. This leads to my disappointment of Peter Jackson's film directing abilities. However, I guess a man jumping from a blockbuster as "The Frighteners" (sarcasm) lived up to my expectations. Peter Jackson is not a young man and seeing how terrible his films were before LOTR, I expected a story driven film trilogy. Why was he chosen for this film? What credits does he have that make him honorable? Any director that has such a powerful license to a story such as LOTR is going to be successful. If you look at the film from a director's perspective, there is nothing special about it. The film is watered down to nothing more than overhead fly-bys, which gets very old, early in the film it was like watching "Behind Enemy Lines" again. The battle scenes are gorgeous simply because of location and CG, but there's no uniqueness to them. Something Peter Jackson needs to make in order to make him stand out as one of the great directors to date. He does not take advantage of the opportunity he has with LOTR. An amateur film director could have designed the scenes for each battle. They were too simplistic. Mind you, you must get over the strength of the story and look at the basics of the direction of the film. I would've liked to seen what a director such as Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg could have done with LOTR. These film makers always seem to bring something new to the screen with each movie, something that makes them stand out, something Peter Jackson lacks. Many people don't like Spielberg, but I like Spielberg films because they are always beautifully directed, same as Ridley Scott. The point of this editorial is something that everyone should notice and not look at LOTR as the novel, but as the film. Peter Jackson's sub-par direction is hidden behind the story of LOTR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson's LOTR, or how the purists will speak the hell out of him...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "The Two Towers" (TTT) twice, I've realized that "The Lord Of The Rings" (LOTR), apart from establishing itself as one of the pillars of the modern literature, it will achieve the same position in the 7th art world. Those sceptics that prophesied that the ambitious project of Peter Jackson would be a disaster, those guys should keep away from the theaters. Because they aren't obliged to watch Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's universe.I believe the "purists" of the LOTR world won't agree with me when I say that Peter Jackson is leading an incredible job in conjunction with a huge number of people that forms the LOTR staff. Lots of fans complain about that Jackson has sort of invented some parts of the original story created by JRR Tolkien and they ironically say that the film should be titled "Peter Jackson's The LOTR"...For God's sake, if you're so critic, go on: "The Hobbit" and "The Silmarillion" movies are still to be made. Look for a producer who gives you a millionaire budget and show me what you've got ^_^We must understand that Peter Jackson is just another Tolkien's fan who has had the guts to take on with one of the most ambitious projects in the film history and in the movie-adaptation-from-novel thing.TTT is the culmination of what "The Fellowship Of The Ring" (FOTR) was. In the first chapter of the trilogy, everything is shown up but in fact you left the cinema with a bit of emptiness, like smelling the food but not eating it. In the TTT, which is the heart of the novel, it's where the story goes on and the action progresses.Let me talk about plot for a second. (beware: spoiler imminent :P). If you've read the book, then you'll have the same `deja vu' sensation you had in FOTR. But you could possibly complain about the bigger amount of parts which are not in or differ from the book. I think Peter Jackson has done well not including some parts of the novel and I will prove it with the ending of TTT: it's better to end the movie right in front of Mordor than inside Mordor, as the book ends. It's more... movie-like.Also, it's so astonishing how Jackson has achieved a level in the movie to keep up the story because, in my opinion (this is when the `purists' will hang me ^_^), TTT novel is the most difficult to read, because of the plot, which is quite plain compared with the 1st and 3rd book.Talking about the characters, there are new people around the plot, like Éowyn, Théoden, Gríma Wormtongue. but in my opinion the best one is Gollum, such an incredible and realistic CGI character (probably the best one up to date), who steals the acting from Sam and Frodo in some sequences (just don't miss the dialogue between his two personalities. Worth of an Oscar!).Aragorn is probably less active in this sequel, probably because Legolas rocks with his acrobatic movements! Gimli has got a clown-like role, that I really hated through all the film, but however, he somehow fit in it.In conclusion, I'd like to say that `The Two Towers' is one of the most solid sequels I've ever seen. It's darker than the first one and the action is more intense. Peter Jackson is handling the situation with great success. I cannot wait to see `The Return Of The King'. Worth a look! 10/10PD: BTW, c'mon Lucas! Don't spend 3 years to do a movie! Learn from Peter Jackson! ^_^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most highly anticipated film of the year...did it live up to expectations?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's a question not to be answered lightly. It leaves one feeling as though they are stuck in the middle...did we like it better then the first or didn't we? We can't answer! We don't know! TTT is so different to FOTR yet at the same time is so the same. The tone of the film is different and some characters are developed more eg Frodo &amp; gollum. while many are not eg Saruman. New characters were introduced and all were acted brilliantly yet unfortunately we didn't get the chance to form a bond with them as we did with the fellowship in the first film as there just wasn't enough time to get to know them. The 2nd book is undoubtedly the hardest of the 3 books to translate into film. It is also the hardest to read. There are three different stories to follow and though the film interchanged between characters seemlessly unfortunately the story seemed to stray a little from it's main focus: Frodo and his quest to destroy the ring. Yet The film was brilliant, don't get me wrong. Everyone went in with very high expectations which is never a good thing when seeing a film, yet none left feeling very disappointed. The opening scene was one of the best, with the camera panning over mountains with whispers of dialogue from the first film to be heard in the background and then the reply of Gandalfs "death" but from different angles to keep fans from feeling cheated. The music was also a huge highlight keeping old themes and adding new ones. The actor who developed the most in this film and who is also terribly under-appreciated was Elijah Wood. His character changed so much from what it was like in FOTR. He is obviously and believably falling ill to the ring and his evil spells were very disturbing to watch as was the relationship between himself, Sam and Gollum - perhaps the best ever CGI character to date. It would have been nice to see a little more of them and also a bit more of Merry and Pippin. Bilbo's complete absence was also a down point. A little less Arwen to make room for Bilbo wouldn't have gone astray, yet the flashbacks let us learn the true depth and strains of Arwen and Aragorn relationship. Over all TTT is a brilliant film though I seem to have focused on mainly the bad points. It is alot funnier and darker and more unsettling. The beautiful scenery in still there looking wonderful and all the actors were magnificent. Peter Jackson had done a marvelous job translating the hardest of the 3 books into film! I give it a 9/10 and I will certainly be going to see it for the 4th time tomorrow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An achievement, not fully recognised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has done something few others have done, or even fantazed doing. He has produced and is still completing a single 9 hour movie. The only other attempt was Joseph Mankiewicz's attempt at Cleopatra. However the financial backers never let that movie go to the planned three, 3 hour movies that were onced planned. Peter Jackson must have always had it in his mind to achieve a true master pice. In forgotton silver, a great but little identified docu- comedy, Peter Jackson produced a story of McKenzie a fictitious movie maker who tried to produced a 9 hour movie of Salome it is an obvious satire of Mankiewicz's Cleopatra. Does it reflect Jacksons later ambition in LOTR. Even then Jackson must have had it mind to produce an achievement that few have yet to recognise adequately. Jackson is the first directer to produce one of the longest movies in history while keeping his audiences waiting for more(a three year staggered release time must be the longest for any movie in history. I like many others await the release of the final part of this movie. I have one question will we see the whole movie played at Cinemas( in one 9 hour sitting) in the next few years? Unfortunately I suspect not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I loved it, best film of the year for me (it hasnt been a great year, mind) but definetly flawed...the good points of the film have been mentioned extensively in the preceeding reviews, so Ill just get a bit nit-picky, if thats alright. Theres a few SPOILERS here and there, but come on, youve seen it already.It seems bloody long...seems longer than FOTR, i think because so much goes on, its exhausting. Plus the editing is a bit mad. I would have much preferred to see less of treebeard meandering around mumbling and more of M + P in the hands of the sarf london orcs.Helms deep... after all the hype. I heard a lot about it before i saw it, heard comparisons to gladiator and Braveheart...rubbish. I found it tedious, and for one reason. THERE IS NO DANGER. Our heroes are utterly invulnerable. They wave their weapons and a dozen uruk-hai are stuck dead immediately. Haldir buys the farm...well, excuse me while i roll sobbing into a grief stricken ball. Hes a bloody extra with about 4 lines of dialogue (over two films!) There is no loss...no sense of menace...I was horrified to hear the "counting game" from the book was included...pass the sick bag vicar. Legolas and gimli might as well have whipped out their respective Elf and dwarf-hoods and started measuring..."Hah, what say you to that, master elf? See? three and a half, no, three and three quarter inches!""Alas, good gimli...behold...Five inches, forsooth.""(grumble)well...tis cold..."Its utterly crass. And this isnt a issue of suspension of disbelief either. When the heroes are going through the motions - parry-kill, parry-kill, fancy move, parry-kill, surf down steps -ITS NOT EXCITING. ITS...VERY...BORING. You might as well watch arnie in "Commando". By the time the battle was half way over i was actively rooting for the uruk-hai.And as for the end...the heroes on horseback charging through the swarms of orcs like a vaguely inconvenient black fog, the rohirrim charging downhill onto a forest of spears (wouldnt that have resulted in about 2,000 horse kebabs? Or did Gandalf turn all the spears to rubber?) Even my 10 year old nephew thought the end was "dumb".Shouldnt the second film in a trilogy like this end of a note of despair, loss, tragedy? I just wish PJ gone the whole hog and thinned out the overlarge cast a bit more. Killing off Eomer and legolas at helms deep would have impressed. And if i were PJ, i wouldnt worry about upsetting the hardcore tolkien fans either...theyll always be moaning about something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Part 1 again, I couldn't help having my hopes up for part 2. Honestly I was a bit disappointed. This one is, as the voting statistics indicate, more targeted at a women's audience. Good looking blokes roaming the countryside... In my humble opinion this episode has less diversity than the first part. Especially the first two hours couldn't thrill me apart from the, again, stunning scenery.Well, still, check this one out, be it only for the amazing special effects, a expert-level training in horse-mounting and especially Gollem and our good friend Gimli (the dwarf) who is extraordinarily funny in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(spoiler alert) a film flawed for being too short!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, I am a Tolkien fan that has enjoyed the books and associated art for years. I never thought anyone could possibly put this material on the big screen without butchering it so much it would not have the same magic.Peter Jackson has proved me so wrong, watching the Fellowship (about 30 times now!) and The Two Towers three times I feel I have been transported into Middle Earth in all its glory! Yes, I know the films have missed bits of the book out (Tom Bambardil for instance), enhanced some characters (Arwin being a good example, but seeing more of Liv Tyler is not a bad thing), changed dialogue (everyone I would say) and have characters appear where they shouldn't be (Sam and Frodo at osgiliath for instance). I agree with peter Jackson that it was necessary to change things around for the sake of making the movies as entertaining as possible whilst keeping as much of the essence of the book as possible. Therefore, i forgive Peter for all of the changes he has done, in fact he has even improved it in some places like the elves turning up to fight at Helms Deep, superb moment.After the disaster of the cgi created character Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I, I was really worried Gollum and Treebeard in The Two Towers. I was astonished with the realism of Gollum, I forgot he was cgi'd when I was watching him which is the ultimate test i would say. Treebeard was well done as well, would have liked to have seen more of him espiecially in his Ent house, hopefully we will see more on the extended DVD I am expecting late next year.One question, how did Aragorn manage to put his sword back into its sheath when he fell off the cliff? Is there a break in continuity here?Getting Alan Lee and John Howe involved in the artwork for the film was a master stroke, so many scenes looked just as if they had been lifted straight from their paintings.Well done to all those that worked on the film, but particulary Peter Jackson, he is a genius. Can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Story, Sub-par Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will make my comments away from the film's story but about the film's directing. We all know that the LOTR has one of the most powerful stories ever in the media (including literature). I've never read the novels but still very much enjoy the story on film. However, I can only imagine what the film would be like if it had a better director. My opinion of "The Two Towers" is the same as "The Fellowship of the Ring". Both films are driven by story. I enjoyed both films extremely only because of the stories. This leads to my disappointment of Peter Jackson's film directing abilities. However, I guess a man jumping from a blockbuster as "The Frighteners" (sarcasm) lived up to my expectations. Peter Jackson is not a young man and seeing how terrible his films were before LOTR, I expected a story driven film trilogy. Why was he chosen for this film? What credits does he have that make him honorable? Any director that has such a powerful license to a story such as LOTR is going to be successful. If you look at the film from a director's perspective, there is nothing special about it. The film is watered down to nothing more than overhead fly-bys, which gets very old, early in the film it was like watching "Behind Enemy Lines" again.

		<shortDescription>(spoiler alert) a film flawed for being too short!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, I am a Tolkien fan that has enjoyed the books and associated art for years. I never thought anyone could possibly put this material on the big screen without butchering it so much it would not have the same magic.Peter Jackson has proved me so wrong, watching the Fellowship (about 30 times now!) and The Two Towers three times I feel I have been transported into Middle Earth in all its glory! Yes, I know the films have missed bits of the book out (Tom Bambardil for instance), enhanced some characters (Arwin being a good example, but seeing more of Liv Tyler is not a bad thing), changed dialogue (everyone I would say) and have characters appear where they shouldn't be (Sam and Frodo at osgiliath for instance). I agree with peter Jackson that it was necessary to change things around for the sake of making the movies as entertaining as possible whilst keeping as much of the essence of the book as possible. Therefore, i forgive Peter for all of the changes he has done, in fact he has even improved it in some places like the elves turning up to fight at Helms Deep, superb moment.After the disaster of the cgi created character Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I, I was really worried Gollum and Treebeard in The Two Towers. I was astonished with the realism of Gollum, I forgot he was cgi'd when I was watching him which is the ultimate test i would say. Treebeard was well done as well, would have liked to have seen more of him espiecially in his Ent house, hopefully we will see more on the extended DVD I am expecting late next year.One question, how did Aragorn manage to put his sword back into its sheath when he fell off the cliff? Is there a break in continuity here?Getting Alan Lee and John Howe involved in the artwork for the film was a master stroke, so many scenes looked just as if they had been lifted straight from their paintings.Well done to all those that worked on the film, but particulary Peter Jackson, he is a genius. Can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I loved it, best film of the year for me (it hasnt been a great year, mind) but definetly flawed...the good points of the film have been mentioned extensively in the preceeding reviews, so Ill just get a bit nit-picky, if thats alright. Theres a few SPOILERS here and there, but come on, youve seen it already.It seems bloody long...seems longer than FOTR, i think because so much goes on, its exhausting. Plus the editing is a bit mad. I would have much preferred to see less of treebeard meandering around mumbling and more of M + P in the hands of the sarf london orcs.Helms deep... after all the hype. I heard a lot about it before i saw it, heard comparisons to gladiator and Braveheart...rubbish. I found it tedious, and for one reason. THERE IS NO DANGER. Our heroes are utterly invulnerable. They wave their weapons and a dozen uruk-hai are stuck dead immediately. Haldir buys the farm...well, excuse me while i roll sobbing into a grief stricken ball. Hes a bloody extra with about 4 lines of dialogue (over two films!) There is no loss...no sense of menace...I was horrified to hear the "counting game" from the book was included...pass the sick bag vicar. Legolas and gimli might as well have whipped out their respective Elf and dwarf-hoods and started measuring..."Hah, what say you to that, master elf? See? three and a half, no, three and three quarter inches!""Alas, good gimli...behold...Five inches, forsooth.""(grumble)well...tis cold..."Its utterly crass. And this isnt a issue of suspension of disbelief either. When the heroes are going through the motions - parry-kill, parry-kill, fancy move, parry-kill, surf down steps -ITS NOT EXCITING. ITS...VERY...BORING. You might as well watch arnie in "Commando". By the time the battle was half way over i was actively rooting for the uruk-hai.And as for the end...the heroes on horseback charging through the swarms of orcs like a vaguely inconvenient black fog, the rohirrim charging downhill onto a forest of spears (wouldnt that have resulted in about 2,000 horse kebabs? Or did Gandalf turn all the spears to rubber?) Even my 10 year old nephew thought the end was "dumb".Shouldnt the second film in a trilogy like this end of a note of despair, loss, tragedy? I just wish PJ gone the whole hog and thinned out the overlarge cast a bit more. Killing off Eomer and legolas at helms deep would have impressed. And if i were PJ, i wouldnt worry about upsetting the hardcore tolkien fans either...theyll always be moaning about something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellant film, but what happened to the real Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring, I dcided that i could not wait a year to find out what happened next, so i decided to read the books (all three), from reading the TT i had expected the film to be even better than the first (and the third (Return of the King) to be better still). Unfortunatly, when i saw the film, i was disappointed that Tolkien's story was lost, many scenes were lost, many characters were portrayed differently such as Faramir and Gimli. Faramir was a likeable heroric man in the books, but portrayed as an enemy to Frodo and Sam in the film. Gimli has become the comic centre of the films, lacking his serous character in the books. Also,where in the book was Aragorn believed to be dead? The title of the film is the "Two Towers", in the book, the Ents overrun Isengard (as in the film, although not such a major part as it should have been) and the tower of Cirith Ungol where Sam finds Frodo locked up after their battle with Shelob, this tower is non existant in the film and the film does not deserve it's title as the Two Towers, more like "The One Tower that features at the end". I don't like to complain because I thought that the film itself was a masterpiece (one of the best films I have ever seen), with a super scene with Gollum talking to himself (may i add that I think gollum is the best CG character ever). The Ents were another masterpiece of the CGs and helped along with wonderfull acting from all involved (special credit to Andy Serkis for Gollum). Another high point was the music, I loved Howard Shore's score and it captured the world of Middle Earth perfectly again. Gollum's song is superb and makes you feel sorry for the creature, and the theme fo Rohan is also just wonderfull. Overall, this film is much darker than FOTR and ends in the superb battle of Helm's Deep. If this battle is anything to go by, then the battles in Return of the king are going to be aweinspiring. Congratulations for a super film, but a shame it's not quite the real Two Towers. For the film i give it 10/10, for a portrayal of Tolkien's Two Towers, just a 6/10. Sorry Peter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a literary masterpiece comes another exceptional film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who would claim that The Two Towers is sub-par just because Peter Jackson did not religiously adhere to the book are being entirely unreasonable. I would remind them that although Tolkien was a literary genius, he was not a screenwriter or a film maker. Jackson did an exceptional job with this latest work by sifting through Tolkien's massive work and accentuating the portions which have the greatest amount of cinematic appeal. Remember that film is an entirely different form and medium for artistic expression and should be treated as such. Enjoy the film for its incredible story, the beauty of the New Zealand landscape, the formidable acting, and the absolutely mesmerizing visual effects. This trilogy will without a doubt be remembered as one of the all-time great achievements in film. Excellent work Mr. Jackson!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great story, faithful? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was great, a little too much focus on the fantastic scenery that is New Zealand, but if you've got it why not flaunt it.I've read a few reviews, damning Peter Jackson for the story line, I'll not add to that damning, just a bit of disappointment.We've got to look at the fact that this is an interpretation of the story, yes Peter and Co have rewritten a bit here and a bit there (obviously these bits vary in a) size, b) sentimental value to the Tolkien fan and c) a major part of the plot or character development).To digress for a moment, The Two Towers was not the second book in a trilogy until Unwin and Allen decided that the 1300 odd pages was too much for a book at that time for the general reading public, so The Two Towers was a fill in, a way to develop characters and plots, before the climatic ending just as the middle of most books / stories are.Why did Peter and Co change the story and characters? I don't know. They did, I may not agree with the changes, but for someone that is not a Tolkien fan with their own pre-conceived ideas the story line and movie was fantastic.*SPOILER WARNING*For me, the condensed, sun dried Ent's story was very disappointing the shortened Entmoot, lack of Ent brew and of course the trees coming to the aid of Helms Deep. The loss of the on going relationship between Legolas and Gimli and missing of the finality (although they still have the Return Of The King to go) of the counting of who killed more Orcs than the other, was a nice way to lighten an otherwise very dark battle. Faramir's dark side was a bit of a shock, but thinking on it he could be protrayed as a darker, slightly morbid sulking type of personallity. The side trip to Osgiliath really did not add to the story line at all, except maybe to give a reason for Faramir to be in the bad books with his father. I'm still coming to grips with the darker side of Elrond though.What did I like about it? The start, the panning down the Misty Mountains, past Dimril Dale, suddenly I realised what was going on, it was the battle of Gandalf and the Balrog! The battle of Helms deep was great, the scenery fantastic. And of course how can one forget Gollum! In parts he looked very un-real, but in others he blended into the scenery so well, the argument between Gollum and Smeagol was brilliantly done.All in all, forgetting my personal dislikes because of the storyline, I still give it a 9/10. For authenticity and faithfullness to the original story and feeling I'd only give it a 5/10. If you are a fan or not I'd recommend you go and watch it, for the fan, forget the story and concentrate on the one written by Peter and Co, its not the epic by Tolkien, but great none the less.As a final comment, I have noticed that someone said the Hobbit or Silmarillion has not been done yet, with some of the omissions to the Lord of The Rings, Peter may have a little difficulty with the Silmarillion, as parts won't flow together all that well, although I think he'll do a great Hobbit :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I never read the trilogy, I would've enjoyed this movie more. The screenwriters basically slaughtered it. One of the noblest characters in the book was Faramir, who did what his brother Boromir could not do, and let Frodo leave for Mordor with the ring. In the movie, Faramir is as bad as Boromir and wants the ring for Gondor. Arrrrrgh! Letting Frodo go shows that even though a man can be tempted, he can overcome. The movie eventually got it right, but only after Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. What a crock!The scene with Saruman's orcs riding the cats (or whatever they were) had no business being in the movie. The screenwriters could've used the time to show more of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard, but they just glossed over this very important part.Also, what's this crap with the almost love triangle among Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond? Yuck! If I'd wanted a chick flick, I wouldn't have gone to see The Two Towers.I saw "Fellowship" several times in the theatre, but "The Two Towers" was a dud. I'll wait for it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers* Wow!! This was incredible! A year ago I would have never thought I would be going to see Lord of the Rings. The cast was perfect. Elijah Wood made a great Frodo, you could always tell what he was thinking and when he was being possesed. Orlando Bloom was the best Legolas. Peter Jackson couldn't have picked a better person. He added humour and style to the movie. Christopher Lee was an evil Sarumon. Viggo Mortenson did an excellent job as the lovestruck Aragorn. Liv Tyler who played Arwen (the one in which Aragorn loves) was very good as well as the rest of the cast. Some people I know did not like this movie but it had no boring parts. Some may think it was confusing if they had not read the books, but I have not finished the books yet and it made perfect sense. I think everyone should go see this well thought out sequal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B+... the first one was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that it's not really appropriate to review The Two Towers as a straight sequel since LOTR is essentially one nine hour long movie. Still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do.I enjoyed Fellowship an immense amount more than this film. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that I've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. It doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before.My biggest problem with TTT is that the splitting of the Fellowship from Part I really hurts the story. Obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film I found interesting were the events that centered around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. I won't even go into the "other" two hobbits bc if I had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree I was going to stab somebody. The characters work best together. Their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. This one feels rather flat. A lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. It also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. This one kind of felt like I was looking at the same countryside over and over again.Obviously the climax to TTT is far superior to Fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. That and Gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. But the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. They were one of my favorite parts of Fellowship but here they're just cartoons.Now I haven't read the books since I was a kid, but I know that Fellowship was a much better adaptation than TTT. Everything they needed was right there in the pages. Why did they feel the need to change so much? I don't need it to be down to the last detail. Hell, I like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. A level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. THere were only a few moments of TTT that left me with a similar reaction.Don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies I've seen. It's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. Bottom line- Great flick, but not the same rush as Part I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely worth seeing, regardless of whether you have read the books or not. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was that it went off from the book around the second half. Perhaps the worst was the portrayal of Faramir, whose character in the book let Frodo and Sam go as soon as he found out their mission, instead of holding them prisoner in the movie; so basically his character was shortchanged.Aside from that, the movie was awesome, and was better then fellowship in every way. The best part, in my opinion, was the battle of Helm's Deep, I had high expectations for this scene, and it exceeded them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, without a doubt, was one of the best I have ever seen. The only word that I could come up with to describe it was epic, because it embodied that word in all senses. I had my doubts as to whether it would rival the first film, an amazing film in its own right, but this movie in fact was at least twice as good as the first. It was tastefully done and humorous enough to appeal to a broader audience than just the hard core Tolkien fans. My wife saw the movie with me and she said that it was 'awesome.' Her idea of a great movie is Legally Blonde, which, not knocking a good movie, but, I think you know where I'm going with this...I am already anxious to await the opening of Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B+... the first one was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that it's not really appropriate to review The Two Towers as a straight sequel since LOTR is essentially one nine hour long movie. Still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do.I enjoyed Fellowship an immense amount more than this film. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that I've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. It doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before.My biggest problem with TTT is that the splitting of the Fellowship from Part I really hurts the story. Obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film I found interesting were the events that centered around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. I won't even go into the "other" two hobbits bc if I had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree I was going to stab somebody. The characters work best together. Their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. This one feels rather flat. A lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. It also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. This one kind of felt like I was looking at the same countryside over and over again.Obviously the climax to TTT is far superior to Fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. That and Gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. But the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. They were one of my favorite parts of Fellowship but here they're just cartoons.Now I haven't read the books since I was a kid, but I know that Fellowship was a much better adaptation than TTT. Everything they needed was right there in the pages. Why did they feel the need to change so much? I don't need it to be down to the last detail. Hell, I like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. A level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. THere were only a few moments of TTT that left me with a similar reaction.Don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies I've seen. It's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. Bottom line- Great flick, but not the same rush as Part I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie but does not accurately portray the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely worth seeing, regardless of whether you have read the books or not. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was that it went off from the book around the second half. Perhaps the worst was the portrayal of Faramir, whose character in the book let Frodo and Sam go as soon as he found out their mission, instead of holding them prisoner in the movie; so basically his character was shortchanged.Aside from that, the movie was awesome, and was better then fellowship in every way. The best part, in my opinion, was the battle of Helm's Deep, I had high expectations for this scene, and it exceeded them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome this movie is - yes, follows on well from the great Fellowship of the Ring - Frodo, Aragorn, Legolas etc. ever convincing great characters, realistic, the depictions of Mordor OH MY! but what ever did happen to Gimli. I'm sorry to say that the pent-up little tough dwarf from the first movie is gone and is replaced by a walking taking comic with supposed to be funny one liners and silly antics more suitable to cheap sitcoms and worthless talk shows, the Gimli character keeps bringing you back from your graphic trip to Middle-Earth and tells you this is all just a movie - that's all it is - how sad. One minute of editing could soon change everything, though. Happy new year Gimli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B+... the first one was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that it's not really appropriate to review The Two Towers as a straight sequel since LOTR is essentially one nine hour long movie. Still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do.I enjoyed Fellowship an immense amount more than this film. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that I've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. It doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before.My biggest problem with TTT is that the splitting of the Fellowship from Part I really hurts the story. Obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film I found interesting were the events that centered around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. I won't even go into the "other" two hobbits bc if I had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree I was going to stab somebody. The characters work best together. Their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. This one feels rather flat. A lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. It also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. This one kind of felt like I was looking at the same countryside over and over again.Obviously the climax to TTT is far superior to Fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. That and Gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. But the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. They were one of my favorite parts of Fellowship but here they're just cartoons.Now I haven't read the books since I was a kid, but I know that Fellowship was a much better adaptation than TTT. Everything they needed was right there in the pages. Why did they feel the need to change so much? I don't need it to be down to the last detail. Hell, I like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. A level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. THere were only a few moments of TTT that left me with a similar reaction.Don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies I've seen. It's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. Bottom line- Great flick, but not the same rush as Part I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie but does not accurately portray the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely worth seeing, regardless of whether you have read the books or not. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was that it went off from the book around the second half. Perhaps the worst was the portrayal of Faramir, whose character in the book let Frodo and Sam go as soon as he found out their mission, instead of holding them prisoner in the movie; so basically his character was shortchanged.Aside from that, the movie was awesome, and was better then fellowship in every way. The best part, in my opinion, was the battle of Helm's Deep, I had high expectations for this scene, and it exceeded them.</fullReview>

It was tastefully done and humorous enough to appeal to a broader audience than just the hard core Tolkien fans. My wife saw the movie with me and she said that it was 'awesome.'

		<fullReview>Not Quite as true to the book as the first book was, but it excelled in the categories that mattered most. Getting peoples attention after a full year wait, and giving us a 3 hour joy ride into a place where Action and Adventure is as common as the daily sunrise.The movie picked up just where the first one left us. With Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn on the trail of Merry and Perrigrin who had been captured by the attacking Orcs. What follows in this movie is some of the greatest fight scenes, compter animation, and... oh yeah, MORE FIGHT SCENES!!! The fight between Gandalf and the Balrog was very cool, as well as the Wolves of Isengard and Helms Deep fight. The Helms Deep battle was so well done and visualized from the book, that it seemed like they could have made an entire video game about the one single battle if they had wanted too. I dont want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but let me tell you three things. You will not be dissapointed. You will not be neutral. You WILL love it!One final thing needs to be awknowledged. I dont know what category or catagories it would fit into, but i do know that the way Golem streamed seemlessly into the movie needs alot of recognition. I have never seen a more amazing sight than just watching Sam, Frodo and Golem interact together.If ever there is a movie that deserves the ranking of a perfect 10, then this is it. I cant wait to see how good they do on Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the first thing that must be said is that The Two Towers is a better movie than The Fellowship of The Ring. Which I think is the hell of a compliment, because i loved The Fellowship and watched it seven times so far. But it is a worse adaptation of Tolkien´s work, I think, and although some adaptations are understandable, others I think are totally unnecessary, like Aragorn´s near death and Faramir taking Sam and Frodo to Osgliath. I´m not familiar with the maps to know if that even works geographically. I think the time spent in these scenes could be better used for showing Pippin and Merry´s relationship with the Ents, at least have them drinking the water that would make them grow bigger than any other hobbit. Other thing that could have spent more time in screen was the destruction of Isengard by the ents, which plays a fundamental role but is only used as background scene for a Sam´s speech.But what I can say is that after having seen TTT only one time, I can´t make my mind whether I prefer this movie or the first, because TTT is a fantastic movie, with fantastic action scenes, a good dosis of tension and of humor. I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied, although we Tolkien-fans always hope for the most faithful adpatation possible. There was a time in the movie when Arwen and Elrond and Galadriel show up that you just think, was it written in their contracts that everybody had to appear in all the movies?I expect to see TTT yet another many times, but we must difer, one thing is the book, and another one is the movie...I think that Peter Jackson is doing a great job after all. And I can hardly wait for The Return of the King!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is one of the best movies I have seen since The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible, minor spoilers ahead)The Fellowship of the Ring (which was part 1 of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) exceeded every expectation I had. The acting was superb, especially performances by Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood, the music were fantastic, and the special effects were a visual feast. Therefore, I was expecting a lot from The Two Towers. I wanted The Two Towers to capture all the great qualities of the first movie, and if at all possible to exceed the standard of greatness set by the first movie. Did The Two Towers accomplish this task? Of course it did! The Two Towers is an amazing movie!Now, for those of you who want to go see the Two Towers, but have not yet seen the Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly recommend you do so right away. The Two Towers spends little time re-introducing you to the characters and storyline of this series, and as such will likely confuse any newcomers. Now some people may dislike that fact, but I think it was the right decision, because the movie drops right into the action, which gives the story of The Two Towers more forward momentum than the Fellowship of the Ring.As in the first movie, the acting in The Two Towers was great, but the stand out actor in this movie was Andy Serkis, who played (and supplied the voice) to the character of Gollum. Gollum is a creature with a duel personality, which is torn between helping the main character, Frodo, on his quest to destroy the One Ring, and taking the ring for himself. Serkis portrays this aspect of Gollum quite well, and I think his performance is worthy of Oscar consideration.But, the best thing about The Two Towers would have to be the exceptionally well done battle of Helm's Deep. If you like battle scenes such as those seen in movies like Gladiator and Braveheart, prepare to be blown away. The sheer scale of the battle, which features an army of 10,000 orc warriors, is sure to delight and impress anyone who sees it.Admittedly, the first half of the movie has a few slow spots, but they are quickly forgotten by the end of the movie. Fans of the Fellowship of the Ring will not be disappointed, and even those who did not like the first movie, may change their minds about the series after seeing The Two Towers. It is my favourite movie of the year, and it should be considered a contender for an Oscar. Kudos to director Peter Jackson for another fine movie.I give The Two Towers 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it is a fascinating movie - that's God's own truth. It has great vision, great effects, great story and the battles - wow, that's the battles we know and love! There was very strong moments, especially in the siege of the Rohan riders.Another plus is the humour - the movie has a lot of humour, especially between Gimli and Legolas. But there was some problems. It was too quick, if you haven't read the book, you'll hardly understand anything. There wasn't very much character development. And the biggest problem: THERE WAS NO BOSS! You understand me. In the first movie we have the Balrog, in the "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - the Basilisk, in "Attack of the Clones" - Darth Tyrannus. In this film there was various monsters, but not real boss, and that's because they cut Shelob. However, it was really good movie. I rated it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right choices..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his latest film, New Zealand's Peter Jackson has given us the Two Towers we wanted and deserved: rich, harsh, violent, alive, green, black and grey. Middle-Earth looms large as the greatest world the movies have yet given us. The fighting here is fiercer - there is sublime pleasure in the sight of lopped-off, muddy Orc heads arching end over end, of Uruk-hai spilling inky blood on the ruined walls of Helm's Deep. Hoo boy! Killing, in the noble name of all that is good and right in the world, has never looked more bad-ass and cool!But the greatest battle scenes in recent film history are only part of the pleasure: Jackson skillfully juxtaposes the scenes at Helm's Deep with Frodo and Sam's funereal march to the lands of Sauron and with the triumphant march of the Ents against the foul and mechanical forces of Saruman. Frodo's passivity is punctuated by opaque rages, and there is great suspense in his own struggle and his struggle with the blighted creature Gollum (likewise in Gollum's self-struggle). The suspense in this film is of the best kind - it doesn't hinge on gradual revelation of plot points (besides, most of us know the plot backwards by now); instead, the suspense originates in identification, what could be called moral suspense. Middle-Earth is our world too, clearly allegorical (despite what Tolkien says) to our own struggles with technology, the dark, extrinsic forces of religious fundamentalism and the darker, intrinsic forces of our own nature. The Ring is attuned to both. Frodo is us, in his seemingly hopeless battle to retain his self, against the endless will and variety of evil arrayed against and within him.The scenes with the Ents have been criticized on structural grounds, because they slow down the pace of the other two narratives. That is their weakness; their strength is that they provide respite from the otherwise demoralizing palette of grey, brown and black. The Ents, in the absence of a noble, good-humoured Faramir, provide the note of life and hope, and remind us that all nature rebels against the dominion of Sauron. A stirring theme, this one of nature vs. technology. Today, it is still a great, grim battle, and like the struggles in Tolkien's world, it takes place in the larger world and in us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap, nasty over-rated film for the those who are fooling themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this movie is shot with the cheapest cinema film stock giving it a dark blue orange tinge. If the so-called budget was as large as purported KODAK deep vision would have been used to provide rich colour.This film drags out demonstrating the lack of skill from the director. The battle scenes are totally incredulous and totally predicably notwithstanding the premise that most viewers would be obsessed by the original book.The continuity of the film is another sign of bad directing and editing.The acting was even worse with the same portentous tone being used throughout almost every line of dialogue. The attempt at light humour using the "dwarf" (who appears to change in relative dimension throughout the film) is simplistic to the point of banality.The box office success of this film can only be attributed to the blind obsession of those who loved reading the trilogy.The rest is astute marketing. The CGI effects are all plagiarised from other films and the artistic direction the same.The evil forces have the same face structures as the vampires in "Dusk til dawn" and the rest look excessively much like computer game imagery.This is long boring film with repetitious droning music soundtrack that just keeps on repeating. The cover of and adaptation of a famous Children's mythologically based novel turns it to a graphic depiction of bloody battle scenes far to unwholesome for a child audience if not overly boring for them as I observed.The schizophrenic depiction of the mind battle within the Golum is excessively much overworked and to the extent, where you feel like you are listening to a broken record.Lord of the Rings cultists will bit of footage as they indulge themselves in the illusion that this an epic masterpiece. In fact, it is cheap and nasty overrated and highly marketed money making venture by arrogant and conceited rich trust fund moviemakers in New Zealand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SLAUGHTERED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLAUGHTERED! Tolkien would sue from his grave if he saw this film! This is an exact description of what the filmakers did to J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece! In order for the film to become liked from the general public, the film was made in to a typical action love story. Poor Aragorn became a punching bag by adding all the extra action with the woolf riders! The book had a nice flow of events that was disturbed by the extra footage on the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. The battle of Helm's deep was a tragedy since the director thought that it would sell more if the elves sent reinforcements while he increased the orc force to 10,000. Another deviation from the book was Frodo's trip to Osgiliath. This was totaly unnecessary ( i think they did that to increase the film's length) and as an effect it had the total destruction of Faramir's character ( HE didnt try to take the ring away, instead Frodo offered it to him and he denied). In the book, Faramir was meant to right the wrong his brother made ( i see him as a good version of Boromir). I think that you had enough of my wining so I will talk about the film's positive side. The Ents where GREAT! The film caught their characteristics perfectly! The gate of Mordor was GREAT! And finally the oliphant was nice! After measuring all the facts I decided to give this film a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nitpickers are wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fully accept that this film, nor it's predecessor, will be to all tastes. However, it is a shame that such a superb film, crafted by devoted film-makers, is picked apart by some of the comments made within this forum. It is certainly true to say that there are very minor points of criticism that can be levelled against it. But taken against the film as a whole they are largely irrelevant. When I go to see a film I want to be thoroughly entertained and moved by the experience. This film, and FOTR, achieved that. I did not, and never do for that matter, go with the intention of seeking out every minor fault in a film. If I did that, there would be very few that I would enjoy. The nitpickers are a pretty sad bunch and I do wonder whether they set out with the assumption that they would not enjoy the film before seeing it. I have read the book several times over the past 30 years, and despite the diversions, PJ has fully captured the essence of the world Tolkein created. That is one hell of an achievement, and I have no doubt that after ROTK this trilogy will go down in history as one of the landmarks of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a preface, I waited for a second viewing before making a vote or comment. That being said, I gave the movie a perfect 10 and can only make positive comments about the movie.First, it is impossible to say that this movie was either better or worse than LOTR/Fellowship of the Rings, because both movies served different purposes. The first movie devoted much of it's time setting up the story, establishing characters, and familiarizing the viewer with the world of Middle Earth. The second movie was able to move the entire story along. The much more "action" nature of the second movie was probably a result of this. In addition, the Two Towers book also has much more action than the first. Therefore, those differences in the movies can be explained.Second, just like everyone else on the planet, I would concur that the special effects were amazing (although most of my amazement was with the Gollum and character - versus the Helm's Deep battle). The Battle of Pellanor Fields will be incredible!Third, the acting was the part of the movie that really kept me in the story. Lots of movies have big action and cannot keep your attention. The performances by Viggio Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Elijah Wood were very solid.Anyway, many people much more eloquent than me have waxed on about this movie. This was a very good time. If the purpose of the middle act of trilogy is to set up the grand finale, this movie was a complete success. However, it was also an entertaining evening in and of itself.</fullReview>

The sheer scale of the battle, which features an army of 10,000 orc warriors, is sure to delight and impress anyone who sees it.Admittedly, the first half of the movie has a few slow spots, but they are quickly forgotten by the end of the movie. Fans of the Fellowship of the Ring will not be disappointed, and even those who did not like the first movie, may change their minds about the series after seeing The Two Towers. It is my favourite movie of the year, and it should be considered a contender for an Oscar. Kudos to director Peter Jackson for another fine movie.I give The Two Towers 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it is a fascinating movie - that's God's own truth. It has great vision, great effects, great story and the battles - wow, that's the battles we know and love! There was very strong moments, especially in the siege of the Rohan riders.Another plus is the humour - the movie has a lot of humour, especially between Gimli and Legolas. But there was some problems. It was too quick, if you haven't read the book, you'll hardly understand anything. There wasn't very much character development. And the biggest problem: THERE WAS NO BOSS! You understand me. In the first movie we have the Balrog, in the "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - the Basilisk, in "Attack of the Clones" - Darth Tyrannus. In this film there was various monsters, but not real boss, and that's because they cut Shelob. However, it was really good movie. I rated it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right choices..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his latest film, New Zealand's Peter Jackson has given us the Two Towers we wanted and deserved: rich, harsh, violent, alive, green, black and grey. Middle-Earth looms large as the greatest world the movies have yet given us. The fighting here is fiercer - there is sublime pleasure in the sight of lopped-off, muddy Orc heads arching end over end, of Uruk-hai spilling inky blood on the ruined walls of Helm's Deep. Hoo boy! Killing, in the noble name of all that is good and right in the world, has never looked more bad-ass and cool!But the greatest battle scenes in recent film history are only part of the pleasure: Jackson skillfully juxtaposes the scenes at Helm's Deep with Frodo and Sam's funereal march to the lands of Sauron and with the triumphant march of the Ents against the foul and mechanical forces of Saruman. Frodo's passivity is punctuated by opaque rages, and there is great suspense in his own struggle and his struggle with the blighted creature Gollum (likewise in Gollum's self-struggle). The suspense in this film is of the best kind - it doesn't hinge on gradual revelation of plot points (besides, most of us know the plot backwards by now); instead, the suspense originates in identification, what could be called moral suspense. Middle-Earth is our world too, clearly allegorical (despite what Tolkien says) to our own struggles with technology, the dark, extrinsic forces of religious fundamentalism and the darker, intrinsic forces of our own nature. The Ring is attuned to both. Frodo is us, in his seemingly hopeless battle to retain his self, against the endless will and variety of evil arrayed against and within him.The scenes with the Ents have been criticized on structural grounds, because they slow down the pace of the other two narratives. That is their weakness; their strength is that they provide respite from the otherwise demoralizing palette of grey, brown and black. The Ents, in the absence of a noble, good-humoured Faramir, provide the note of life and hope, and remind us that all nature rebels against the dominion of Sauron. A stirring theme, this one of nature vs. technology. Today, it is still a great, grim battle, and like the struggles in Tolkien's world, it takes place in the larger world and in us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap, nasty over-rated film for the those who are fooling themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this movie is shot with the cheapest cinema film stock giving it a dark blue orange tinge. If the so-called budget was as large as purported KODAK deep vision would have been used to provide rich colour.This film drags out demonstrating the lack of skill from the director. The battle scenes are totally incredulous and totally predicably notwithstanding the premise that most viewers would be obsessed by the original book.The continuity of the film is another sign of bad directing and editing.The acting was even worse with the same portentous tone being used throughout almost every line of dialogue. The attempt at light humour using the "dwarf" (who appears to change in relative dimension throughout the film) is simplistic to the point of banality.The box office success of this film can only be attributed to the blind obsession of those who loved reading the trilogy.The rest is astute marketing. The CGI effects are all plagiarised from other films and the artistic direction the same.The evil forces have the same face structures as the vampires in "Dusk til dawn" and the rest look excessively much like computer game imagery.This is long boring film with repetitious droning music soundtrack that just keeps on repeating. The cover of and adaptation of a famous Children's mythologically based novel turns it to a graphic depiction of bloody battle scenes far to unwholesome for a child audience if not overly boring for them as I observed.The schizophrenic depiction of the mind battle within the Golum is excessively much overworked and to the extent, where you feel like you are listening to a broken record.Lord of the Rings cultists will bit of footage as they indulge themselves in the illusion that this an epic masterpiece. In fact, it is cheap and nasty overrated and highly marketed money making venture by arrogant and conceited rich trust fund moviemakers in New Zealand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SLAUGHTERED! Tolkien would sue from his grave if he saw this film! This is an exact description of what the filmakers did to J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece! In order for the film to become liked from the general public, the film was made in to a typical action love story. Poor Aragorn became a punching bag by adding all the extra action with the woolf riders! The book had a nice flow of events that was disturbed by the extra footage on the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. The battle of Helm's deep was a tragedy since the director thought that it would sell more if the elves sent reinforcements while he increased the orc force to 10,000. Another deviation from the book was Frodo's trip to Osgiliath. This was totaly unnecessary ( i think they did that to increase the film's length) and as an effect it had the total destruction of Faramir's character ( HE didnt try to take the ring away, instead Frodo offered it to him and he denied). In the book, Faramir was meant to right the wrong his brother made ( i see him as a good version of Boromir). I think that you had enough of my wining so I will talk about the film's positive side. The Ents where GREAT! The film caught their characteristics perfectly! The gate of Mordor was GREAT! And finally the oliphant was nice! After measuring all the facts I decided to give this film a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fully accept that this film, nor it's predecessor, will be to all tastes. However, it is a shame that such a superb film, crafted by devoted film-makers, is picked apart by some of the comments made within this forum. It is certainly true to say that there are very minor points of criticism that can be levelled against it. But taken against the film as a whole they are largely irrelevant. When I go to see a film I want to be thoroughly entertained and moved by the experience. This film, and FOTR, achieved that. I did not, and never do for that matter, go with the intention of seeking out every minor fault in a film. If I did that, there would be very few that I would enjoy. The nitpickers are a pretty sad bunch and I do wonder whether they set out with the assumption that they would not enjoy the film before seeing it. I have read the book several times over the past 30 years, and despite the diversions, PJ has fully captured the essence of the world Tolkein created. That is one hell of an achievement, and I have no doubt that after ROTK this trilogy will go down in history as one of the landmarks of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a preface, I waited for a second viewing before making a vote or comment. That being said, I gave the movie a perfect 10 and can only make positive comments about the movie.First, it is impossible to say that this movie was either better or worse than LOTR/Fellowship of the Rings, because both movies served different purposes. The first movie devoted much of it's time setting up the story, establishing characters, and familiarizing the viewer with the world of Middle Earth. The second movie was able to move the entire story along. The much more "action" nature of the second movie was probably a result of this. In addition, the Two Towers book also has much more action than the first. Therefore, those differences in the movies can be explained.Second, just like everyone else on the planet, I would concur that the special effects were amazing (although most of my amazement was with the Gollum and character - versus the Helm's Deep battle). The Battle of Pellanor Fields will be incredible!Third, the acting was the part of the movie that really kept me in the story. Lots of movies have big action and cannot keep your attention. The performances by Viggio Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Elijah Wood were very solid.Anyway, many people much more eloquent than me have waxed on about this movie. This was a very good time. If the purpose of the middle act of trilogy is to set up the grand finale, this movie was a complete success. However, it was also an entertaining evening in and of itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the first thing that must be said is that The Two Towers is a better movie than The Fellowship of The Ring. Which I think is the hell of a compliment, because i loved The Fellowship and watched it seven times so far. But it is a worse adaptation of Tolkien´s work, I think, and although some adaptations are understandable, others I think are totally unnecessary, like Aragorn´s near death and Faramir taking Sam and Frodo to Osgliath. I´m not familiar with the maps to know if that even works geographically. I think the time spent in these scenes could be better used for showing Pippin and Merry´s relationship with the Ents, at least have them drinking the water that would make them grow bigger than any other hobbit. Other thing that could have spent more time in screen was the destruction of Isengard by the ents, which plays a fundamental role but is only used as background scene for a Sam´s speech.But what I can say is that after having seen TTT only one time, I can´t make my mind whether I prefer this movie or the first, because TTT is a fantastic movie, with fantastic action scenes, a good dosis of tension and of humor. I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied, although we Tolkien-fans always hope for the most faithful adpatation possible. There was a time in the movie when Arwen and Elrond and Galadriel show up that you just think, was it written in their contracts that everybody had to appear in all the movies?I expect to see TTT yet another many times, but we must difer, one thing is the book, and another one is the movie...I think that Peter Jackson is doing a great job after all.

		<fullReview>(Possible, minor spoilers ahead)The Fellowship of the Ring (which was part 1 of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) exceeded every expectation I had. The acting was superb, especially performances by Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood, the music were fantastic, and the special effects were a visual feast. Therefore, I was expecting a lot from The Two Towers. I wanted The Two Towers to capture all the great qualities of the first movie, and if at all possible to exceed the standard of greatness set by the first movie. Did The Two Towers accomplish this task? Of course it did! The Two Towers is an amazing movie!Now, for those of you who want to go see the Two Towers, but have not yet seen the Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly recommend you do so right away. The Two Towers spends little time re-introducing you to the characters and storyline of this series, and as such will likely confuse any newcomers. Now some people may dislike that fact, but I think it was the right decision, because the movie drops right into the action, which gives the story of The Two Towers more forward momentum than the Fellowship of the Ring.As in the first movie, the acting in The Two Towers was great, but the stand out actor in this movie was Andy Serkis, who played (and supplied the voice) to the character of Gollum. Gollum is a creature with a duel personality, which is torn between helping the main character, Frodo, on his quest to destroy the One Ring, and taking the ring for himself. Serkis portrays this aspect of Gollum quite well, and I think his performance is worthy of Oscar consideration.But, the best thing about The Two Towers would have to be the exceptionally well done battle of Helm's Deep.

If you like battle scenes such as those seen in movies like Gladiator and Braveheart, prepare to be blown away. The sheer scale of the battle, which features an army of 10,000 orc warriors, is sure to delight and impress anyone who sees it.Admittedly, the first half of the movie has a few slow spots, but they are quickly forgotten by the end of the movie. Fans of the Fellowship of the Ring will not be disappointed, and even those who did not like the first movie, may change their minds about the series after seeing The Two Towers. It is my favourite movie of the year, and it should be considered a contender for an Oscar. Kudos to director Peter Jackson for another fine movie.I give The Two Towers 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it is a fascinating movie - that's God's own truth. It has great vision, great effects, great story and the battles - wow, that's the battles we know and love! There was very strong moments, especially in the siege of the Rohan riders.Another plus is the humour - the movie has a lot of humour, especially between Gimli and Legolas. But there was some problems. It was too quick, if you haven't read the book, you'll hardly understand anything. There wasn't very much character development. And the biggest problem: THERE WAS NO BOSS! You understand me. In the first movie we have the Balrog, in the "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - the Basilisk, in "Attack of the Clones" - Darth Tyrannus. In this film there was various monsters, but not real boss, and that's because they cut Shelob. However, it was really good movie. I rated it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right choices..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his latest film, New Zealand's Peter Jackson has given us the Two Towers we wanted and deserved: rich, harsh, violent, alive, green, black and grey. Middle-Earth looms large as the greatest world the movies have yet given us. The fighting here is fiercer - there is sublime pleasure in the sight of lopped-off, muddy Orc heads arching end over end, of Uruk-hai spilling inky blood on the ruined walls of Helm's Deep. Hoo boy! Killing, in the noble name of all that is good and right in the world, has never looked more bad-ass and cool!But the greatest battle scenes in recent film history are only part of the pleasure: Jackson skillfully juxtaposes the scenes at Helm's Deep with Frodo and Sam's funereal march to the lands of Sauron and with the triumphant march of the Ents against the foul and mechanical forces of Saruman. Frodo's passivity is punctuated by opaque rages, and there is great suspense in his own struggle and his struggle with the blighted creature Gollum (likewise in Gollum's self-struggle). The suspense in this film is of the best kind - it doesn't hinge on gradual revelation of plot points (besides, most of us know the plot backwards by now); instead, the suspense originates in identification, what could be called moral suspense. Middle-Earth is our world too, clearly allegorical (despite what Tolkien says) to our own struggles with technology, the dark, extrinsic forces of religious fundamentalism and the darker, intrinsic forces of our own nature. The Ring is attuned to both. Frodo is us, in his seemingly hopeless battle to retain his self, against the endless will and variety of evil arrayed against and within him.The scenes with the Ents have been criticized on structural grounds, because they slow down the pace of the other two narratives. That is their weakness; their strength is that they provide respite from the otherwise demoralizing palette of grey, brown and black. The Ents, in the absence of a noble, good-humoured Faramir, provide the note of life and hope, and remind us that all nature rebels against the dominion of Sauron. A stirring theme, this one of nature vs. technology. Today, it is still a great, grim battle, and like the struggles in Tolkien's world, it takes place in the larger world and in us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals, disappointing story changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While marveling at the astounding visuals presented in "The Two Towers", I could not help but be somewhat chagrined at the alterations to the original story line. Having been a Tolkien fan since the mid 1960s, and having read all of his writings, I could not but watch the movie with the hope of seeing a screen rendition to the original book. In the first film, "The Fellowship of the Ring", I was disappointed with the story changes, but saw the wisdom of them in light of the mission of making a movie of reasonable length which would also appeal to those unfamiliar with the original writings. In the second installment, "The Two Towers", I expected some abridgement of the story and the occasional addition or alteration for cinematic necessity. However, what I did in fact see, were some wholesale alterations to the story that did not seem to serve any cinematic purpose. The change in the story concerning the actions of the Ents was no shorter or clearer than a true rendering of the story would have been. The same was true with the banishment of Eomer, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn and the encounter between Frodo and Faramir (especially Faramir's kidnapping of Frodo to Osgiliath and the ridiculous encounter between Frodo and the flying Ringwraith there). Yes, the evil influence of the ring may have been somewhat more emphatic with the story changes, but this is more than offset by the loss of emphasis on Frodo's role in the story. If you are a fan of Tolkien's vision, I think that you should still go see the movie; changes notwithstanding. It is a visual masterpiece, especially the CGI Gollum. However, I think that it was Roger Ebert (in his review in the "Chicago Sun Times") who stated things best: "To do what he (Peter Jackson) has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dividing fans down the middle again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the books in the same near-religious manner as Christopher Lee since I was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). So for the better part of twenty years, I have been immersed in the world of Tolkien and his characters. The simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story.The novel is often a confused tome. Events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. In spite of being the shortest volume in the series, The Two Towers takes the longest time to read. Partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because Tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. Even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people I've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is.I also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell Arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the Tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with Aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. This is actually a very good move. All we read about Arwen is a few sentences (if that) in The Fellowship Of The Ring, then maybe a chapter or two in The Return Of The King. The appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but Tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that Aragorn would choose a seemingly docile Elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. The film fixes this by making Arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been.Now where do I begin in describing the film? My only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. But aside from these problems, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Elrond stops telling people "YOU must do this, YOU must destroy that", drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving Middle-Earth while it is in such peril. And where do I begin with Gollum? We've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to George Lucas, but Gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. He gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes.Treebeard and his fellow Ents are little different. They look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of Tolkien to the viewer. Seeing the early stage of their battle in Isengard, I fully understood the meaning of one of the Sindarin themes in the score music. The English translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like "The forest has declared war", and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. Speaking of the score music, Gollum's Song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. With lyrics like "Don't say I didn't try" or "We are lost, we can never go home", it puts the viewer/listener in Gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while.You might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises.At first I was a bit perplexed by the ending. The novel ends with Shelob poisoing Frodo and Frodo being taken by Orcs while Sam takes the Ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with Gollum muttering to himself about how "she" will take care of those nasty, tricksy little Hobbitses. However, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how Shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what Gollum is on about now. And more than anything, the changes in expression on Gollum's face as the Halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between Frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to Gollum by Sam and the Men Of Gondor. As the film ends, and the credits roll over Gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience.To cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. They will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying "goo-goo gaa-gaa" for two and a half hours at them. Who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. Yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is without any doubt the ultimate showcase of how good cinema can get. Not only is Towers a worthy extenstion of the first instalment, Fellowship, but it is a stand alone thrill ride of cinematic genius.Without warning, without any form of reminder or any chance of catching ones breath, Peter Jackson thrusts us right back into the world of middle-earth and right back into his daring and exciting form of film-making. Unlike most sequals (I guess you can't really call this a sequal) Towers is a completely different and unique film from the first. Towers presents a darker more unforgiving Mddle-earth and is unquestionably a war epic of truly incredible proportions.Watching the film the energy that oozes off the screen in the extremely fast paced and action packed three hours gives you a bizz that many people would relate as the feeling they had when watching The Empire Strikes Back for the first time all those years ago. The chemistry between each character, aided undoubtedly by the first film is electric and every scene serves to advance the film in a positive and entertaining direction. One weeps at the sheer brilliance of the films complex construction and near perfect cinematic execution. This is the stuff dreams are made of, this is the stuff that shapes the way forward in the future of film.Towers is not without flaw, with a screen time limit of three hours much of the book has been cut and changed much to the displeasure of many fans and purists. Still the film stands alone all by itself as grand cinema regardless of how prescious the book is. There are some very obvious computer aided effects, especially when watching the Ents, but these are over shadowed by the sheer joy derived form the events on screen. Peter succeeds where most special effects directors fail, he suspends disbelief so that even the most fake of creations is missed as the audience gets sucked into the events on screen. Speaking of special effects, Gollum/Smeagol will undoubtedly go down in history as the very first succesful completely computer generated characters on film. Yes he is obviously created by a computer, but he looks far better than anything else that has ever been presented and the character itself is an absolute treat and completely steels the show. The emotional high point of the film is stolen by Gollum in his two he scenes where he speaks quite disturbingly to himself as each other alter ego.The acting is all very sifficient and definately above average for any film of this style. Special credits should go to Brad Dourif as Wormtounge who is as evil and cunning as the genius of Peters vision, Elijah as Frodo and Sean as Sam who as a pair make for a great on screen plutonic chemistry defining a lost art of male comradeship, and of course Any Serkis as Gollum.The film is often very light hearted as John-Rhys Davis discards his sombre Dwarf character Gimli from the first film and settles in as the comic-relief, this is a sharp contrast to the films very dark themes. People die, limbs are hacked, the world falls apart around them, but all the while Peter remains focussed on the task at hand and delivers Tolkiens message with the edge that only he can.The Films three climaxes, the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Trashing of isengard and the Siege at Osgilith would all be a single fitting end to any epic film, and then the film leaves you breathless and wanting more... Such torture - if the ending to Fellowship had you wanting more, this willhave you tearing out the seats at the cinema in riot that you have to wait another year... Still to behold the scene at Helm's Deep will be enough, no words can describe this except to say that it is the biggest most spectacular battle on screen and will not fail tpo satify.These films are looking to be the defining trilogy of this century and are certainly groundbreaking near perfect cinema. This once weeped for a good portion of the film, I can only hope the experience is as good as that for everyone else. Peter Jackson, Heres to you and yours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why don't they make producers put disclaimers on movie posters like they do with cigarettes and prescription drugs that could have potentially negative side effects? Something like "Based very loosely on the book of the same title but don't get your hopes up" would have been appreciated. Then at least I could have waited for the DVD rental and not been duped out of the full price of a movie ticket. I felt really cheated after having seen this Disneyfied crapfest that relied heavily on special effects to give it the momentum it otherwise lacked. People who love literature just need to get used to the fact that American filmakers will never trust the American public enough to make a film that is true to the literature that inspired the film. If you don't have a problem with not being true to the original creation then this ranks up there with any other special effects extravaganza. This film lacked the passion and the nobility of the book. The characters said and did things that were not in the book and that went completely against the grain of the book. On a positive note, I'm glad Tolkein himself didn't have to see this parody. He would have been insulted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sympathise with contributors bewailing the changes made to the original text; I too am not completely happy about that! I accept, however,the film maker's right to make changes for technical and practical reasons. I have been most worried so far by the decision to radically alter the story line, vis a vis Frodo and Sam's dealings with Captain Faramir (my most favourite character in the book!); his character has been much diminished. More importantly maybe, I dislike the supposed need for Faramir to decide to send the Ring to Minas Tirith; and the scene which has Frodo actually offering the Ring to the leader of the Nazgul seemed ridiculous,I thought! I've read Peter Jackson's thoughts on the subject but am not convinced! Having read the book each autumn/fall for at least twenty five years, I confess to settled attitudes to the story, and gradiose plot variations do take some swallowing! Having griped, I must compliment all the actors, and production team on what is a truly wonderful film. Aragorn and Gollu seem particularly well realized. It seems unfair to pick ANY characters from so many, but I thought those two particularly splendid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite pearls of filmmaking, disappointing to the faithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Fellowship fully expecting to hate it. I love the books and have read them countless times and know the plots, characters, and even the back stories from Simarillion. Therefore, as I had never seen a book-made-movie that didn't butcher the original, I was ready to rant against the movie. But a funny thing happened: I LOVED IT. Though there were small changes and even large changes, Fellowship stayed true to the vision of Tolkien and brought the story to life quite fantastically.Having made all three movies at the same time, I am astounded that Jackson could have hit a homerun with one and failed so miserably (and blatantly) to follow through on Two Towers. I don't deny that it was visually stunning and, if I hadn't read the books I probably would have adored Towers more than Fellowship. And I also believe that much of the movie was wonderful and stayed true to Tolkien's vision. However, there were glaring aberrations that frankly ruined the movie for me.First and foremost was the TERRIBLE portrayal of Faramir's character. The entire plot of that storyline was changed. Faramir is in Ithilien precisely because he was nothing like his brother Boromir. He never attempts to take the ring, and in fact in the book he makes a point of saying that he knows how corrupting it is - Faramir as a character is closest to Aragorn in temperament. He aids Frodo and Sam on their way, despite knowing that his father (Denethor the Steward of Gondor) will hate him for it. Incidentally, the premise that he takes Frodo and Sam all the way to Osgiliath, where the Wraith sees Frodo and Frodo nearly gives him the ring is absurd, as Sauron would have sent every resource at his command to get the ring at that point - Frodo and Sam's only hope is that Sauron doesn't notice them!)Frankly, I have to say I could have lived much more easily with the other changes: elves at Helm's Deep, the decision to have Aragorn nearly die and appear at the last moment, and the back story of Arwen and Elrond (which ends, bizarrely, with Arwen leaving for the Grey Havens???!!! - I'm interested to see how Jackson extracts her from that), if the prior complaint hadn't made the other changes that more glaring. Unlike some, I understand why Towers did not end with Shelob and the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Orthanc - Return of the King is actually the shortest of the books in text (much of the printed book is actually appendices), and I find it plausible that these issues can be addressed satisfactorily in the next movie (though, if they are omitted at that point I will be sorely disappointed).All told, this is a movie that is good for folks who do not remember the book well, have not read the book, and/or don't really care about Tolkien's vision one whit. I plan to see it again to take it in without the horrified shock I experienced during my first viewing, but I really don't understand why Jackson strayed so far - in many places where the original story added much more depth and would not have detracted from the excitement of the movie or required any additional explanation.I still hold out hope for the final movie, as there were so many pearls in this movie (the Ent's razing of Orthanc was spectacular, the actors portrayed the characters with passion and heart, Gollum was fantastically conceived, and the schizophrenic nature of the book was nicely woven together), but on the whole I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be brief. I have not read any of the books, nor have a seen any of the television previews for this movie, so this was the first time I quite literally was at the edge of my seat! This movie rocked! My favourite part was when the ents finally assaulted Eisenguard, broke the dam, and watching all of Saruman's minions, and thus his dream of conquest, flush down the drain. The look of his face made me smile. I had no idea about the outcome of the battle of Helms Deep. In fact, I thought they were going to loose! After all, the track record about winning and losing in this series is fairly balanced. This was a true feel good movie, with a moral that even if there is few good in this world, it is worth fighting for.Also, with all the readers complaining how Peter Jackson hasn't kept to the book, remember that he is there to film a movie, not film a book. Why can't you critique the movie on its own?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the books in the same near-religious manner as Christopher Lee since I was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). So for the better part of twenty years, I have been immersed in the world of Tolkien and his characters. The simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story.The novel is often a confused tome. Events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. In spite of being the shortest volume in the series, The Two Towers takes the longest time to read. Partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because Tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. Even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people I've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is.I also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell Arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the Tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with Aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. This is actually a very good move. All we read about Arwen is a few sentences (if that) in The Fellowship Of The Ring, then maybe a chapter or two in The Return Of The King. The appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but Tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that Aragorn would choose a seemingly docile Elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. The film fixes this by making Arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been.Now where do I begin in describing the film? My only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. But aside from these problems, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Elrond stops telling people "YOU must do this, YOU must destroy that", drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving Middle-Earth while it is in such peril. And where do I begin with Gollum? We've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to George Lucas, but Gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. He gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes.Treebeard and his fellow Ents are little different. They look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of Tolkien to the viewer. Seeing the early stage of their battle in Isengard, I fully understood the meaning of one of the Sindarin themes in the score music. The English translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like "The forest has declared war", and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. Speaking of the score music, Gollum's Song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. With lyrics like "Don't say I didn't try" or "We are lost, we can never go home", it puts the viewer/listener in Gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while.You might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises.At first I was a bit perplexed by the ending. The novel ends with Shelob poisoing Frodo and Frodo being taken by Orcs while Sam takes the Ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with Gollum muttering to himself about how "she" will take care of those nasty, tricksy little Hobbitses. However, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how Shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what Gollum is on about now. And more than anything, the changes in expression on Gollum's face as the Halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between Frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to Gollum by Sam and the Men Of Gondor. As the film ends, and the credits roll over Gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience.To cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. They will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying "goo-goo gaa-gaa" for two and a half hours at them. Who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. Yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is without any doubt the ultimate showcase of how good cinema can get. Not only is Towers a worthy extenstion of the first instalment, Fellowship, but it is a stand alone thrill ride of cinematic genius.Without warning, without any form of reminder or any chance of catching ones breath, Peter Jackson thrusts us right back into the world of middle-earth and right back into his daring and exciting form of film-making. Unlike most sequals (I guess you can't really call this a sequal) Towers is a completely different and unique film from the first. Towers presents a darker more unforgiving Mddle-earth and is unquestionably a war epic of truly incredible proportions.Watching the film the energy that oozes off the screen in the extremely fast paced and action packed three hours gives you a bizz that many people would relate as the feeling they had when watching The Empire Strikes Back for the first time all those years ago. The chemistry between each character, aided undoubtedly by the first film is electric and every scene serves to advance the film in a positive and entertaining direction. One weeps at the sheer brilliance of the films complex construction and near perfect cinematic execution. This is the stuff dreams are made of, this is the stuff that shapes the way forward in the future of film.Towers is not without flaw, with a screen time limit of three hours much of the book has been cut and changed much to the displeasure of many fans and purists. Still the film stands alone all by itself as grand cinema regardless of how prescious the book is. There are some very obvious computer aided effects, especially when watching the Ents, but these are over shadowed by the sheer joy derived form the events on screen. Peter succeeds where most special effects directors fail, he suspends disbelief so that even the most fake of creations is missed as the audience gets sucked into the events on screen. Speaking of special effects, Gollum/Smeagol will undoubtedly go down in history as the very first succesful completely computer generated characters on film. Yes he is obviously created by a computer, but he looks far better than anything else that has ever been presented and the character itself is an absolute treat and completely steels the show. The emotional high point of the film is stolen by Gollum in his two he scenes where he speaks quite disturbingly to himself as each other alter ego.The acting is all very sifficient and definately above average for any film of this style. Special credits should go to Brad Dourif as Wormtounge who is as evil and cunning as the genius of Peters vision, Elijah as Frodo and Sean as Sam who as a pair make for a great on screen plutonic chemistry defining a lost art of male comradeship, and of course Any Serkis as Gollum.The film is often very light hearted as John-Rhys Davis discards his sombre Dwarf character Gimli from the first film and settles in as the comic-relief, this is a sharp contrast to the films very dark themes. People die, limbs are hacked, the world falls apart around them, but all the while Peter remains focussed on the task at hand and delivers Tolkiens message with the edge that only he can.The Films three climaxes, the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Trashing of isengard and the Siege at Osgilith would all be a single fitting end to any epic film, and then the film leaves you breathless and wanting more... Such torture - if the ending to Fellowship had you wanting more, this willhave you tearing out the seats at the cinema in riot that you have to wait another year... Still to behold the scene at Helm's Deep will be enough, no words can describe this except to say that it is the biggest most spectacular battle on screen and will not fail tpo satify.These films are looking to be the defining trilogy of this century and are certainly groundbreaking near perfect cinema. This once weeped for a good portion of the film, I can only hope the experience is as good as that for everyone else. Peter Jackson, Heres to you and yours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why don't they make producers put disclaimers on movie posters like they do with cigarettes and prescription drugs that could have potentially negative side effects? Something like "Based very loosely on the book of the same title but don't get your hopes up" would have been appreciated. Then at least I could have waited for the DVD rental and not been duped out of the full price of a movie ticket. I felt really cheated after having seen this Disneyfied crapfest that relied heavily on special effects to give it the momentum it otherwise lacked. People who love literature just need to get used to the fact that American filmakers will never trust the American public enough to make a film that is true to the literature that inspired the film. If you don't have a problem with not being true to the original creation then this ranks up there with any other special effects extravaganza. This film lacked the passion and the nobility of the book. The characters said and did things that were not in the book and that went completely against the grain of the book. On a positive note, I'm glad Tolkein himself didn't have to see this parody. He would have been insulted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sympathise with contributors bewailing the changes made to the original text; I too am not completely happy about that! I accept, however,the film maker's right to make changes for technical and practical reasons. I have been most worried so far by the decision to radically alter the story line, vis a vis Frodo and Sam's dealings with Captain Faramir (my most favourite character in the book!); his character has been much diminished. More importantly maybe, I dislike the supposed need for Faramir to decide to send the Ring to Minas Tirith; and the scene which has Frodo actually offering the Ring to the leader of the Nazgul seemed ridiculous,I thought! I've read Peter Jackson's thoughts on the subject but am not convinced! Having read the book each autumn/fall for at least twenty five years, I confess to settled attitudes to the story, and gradiose plot variations do take some swallowing! Having griped, I must compliment all the actors, and production team on what is a truly wonderful film. Aragorn and Gollu seem particularly well realized. It seems unfair to pick ANY characters from so many, but I thought those two particularly splendid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite pearls of filmmaking, disappointing to the faithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Fellowship fully expecting to hate it. I love the books and have read them countless times and know the plots, characters, and even the back stories from Simarillion. Therefore, as I had never seen a book-made-movie that didn't butcher the original, I was ready to rant against the movie. But a funny thing happened: I LOVED IT. Though there were small changes and even large changes, Fellowship stayed true to the vision of Tolkien and brought the story to life quite fantastically.Having made all three movies at the same time, I am astounded that Jackson could have hit a homerun with one and failed so miserably (and blatantly) to follow through on Two Towers. I don't deny that it was visually stunning and, if I hadn't read the books I probably would have adored Towers more than Fellowship. And I also believe that much of the movie was wonderful and stayed true to Tolkien's vision. However, there were glaring aberrations that frankly ruined the movie for me.First and foremost was the TERRIBLE portrayal of Faramir's character. The entire plot of that storyline was changed. Faramir is in Ithilien precisely because he was nothing like his brother Boromir. He never attempts to take the ring, and in fact in the book he makes a point of saying that he knows how corrupting it is - Faramir as a character is closest to Aragorn in temperament. He aids Frodo and Sam on their way, despite knowing that his father (Denethor the Steward of Gondor) will hate him for it. Incidentally, the premise that he takes Frodo and Sam all the way to Osgiliath, where the Wraith sees Frodo and Frodo nearly gives him the ring is absurd, as Sauron would have sent every resource at his command to get the ring at that point - Frodo and Sam's only hope is that Sauron doesn't notice them!)Frankly, I have to say I could have lived much more easily with the other changes: elves at Helm's Deep, the decision to have Aragorn nearly die and appear at the last moment, and the back story of Arwen and Elrond (which ends, bizarrely, with Arwen leaving for the Grey Havens???!!! - I'm interested to see how Jackson extracts her from that), if the prior complaint hadn't made the other changes that more glaring. Unlike some, I understand why Towers did not end with Shelob and the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Orthanc - Return of the King is actually the shortest of the books in text (much of the printed book is actually appendices), and I find it plausible that these issues can be addressed satisfactorily in the next movie (though, if they are omitted at that point I will be sorely disappointed).All told, this is a movie that is good for folks who do not remember the book well, have not read the book, and/or don't really care about Tolkien's vision one whit. I plan to see it again to take it in without the horrified shock I experienced during my first viewing, but I really don't understand why Jackson strayed so far - in many places where the original story added much more depth and would not have detracted from the excitement of the movie or required any additional explanation.I still hold out hope for the final movie, as there were so many pearls in this movie (the Ent's razing of Orthanc was spectacular, the actors portrayed the characters with passion and heart, Gollum was fantastically conceived, and the schizophrenic nature of the book was nicely woven together), but on the whole I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be brief. I have not read any of the books, nor have a seen any of the television previews for this movie, so this was the first time I quite literally was at the edge of my seat! This movie rocked! My favourite part was when the ents finally assaulted Eisenguard, broke the dam, and watching all of Saruman's minions, and thus his dream of conquest, flush down the drain. The look of his face made me smile. I had no idea about the outcome of the battle of Helms Deep. In fact, I thought they were going to loose! After all, the track record about winning and losing in this series is fairly balanced. This was a true feel good movie, with a moral that even if there is few good in this world, it is worth fighting for.Also, with all the readers complaining how Peter Jackson hasn't kept to the book, remember that he is there to film a movie, not film a book. Why can't you critique the movie on its own?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals, disappointing story changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While marveling at the astounding visuals presented in "The Two Towers", I could not help but be somewhat chagrined at the alterations to the original story line. Having been a Tolkien fan since the mid 1960s, and having read all of his writings, I could not but watch the movie with the hope of seeing a screen rendition to the original book. In the first film, "The Fellowship of the Ring", I was disappointed with the story changes, but saw the wisdom of them in light of the mission of making a movie of reasonable length which would also appeal to those unfamiliar with the original writings. In the second installment, "The Two Towers", I expected some abridgement of the story and the occasional addition or alteration for cinematic necessity. However, what I did in fact see, were some wholesale alterations to the story that did not seem to serve any cinematic purpose. The change in the story concerning the actions of the Ents was no shorter or clearer than a true rendering of the story would have been. The same was true with the banishment of Eomer, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn and the encounter between Frodo and Faramir (especially Faramir's kidnapping of Frodo to Osgiliath and the ridiculous encounter between Frodo and the flying Ringwraith there). Yes, the evil influence of the ring may have been somewhat more emphatic with the story changes, but this is more than offset by the loss of emphasis on Frodo's role in the story. If you are a fan of Tolkien's vision, I think that you should still go see the movie; changes notwithstanding. It is a visual masterpiece, especially the CGI Gollum. However, I think that it was Roger Ebert (in his review in the "Chicago Sun Times") who stated things best: "To do what he (Peter Jackson) has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver."</fullReview>

Having read the book each autumn/fall for at least twenty five years, I confess to settled attitudes to the story, and gradiose plot variations do take some swallowing! Having griped, I must compliment all the actors, and production team on what is a truly wonderful film. Aragorn and Gollu seem particularly well realized. It seems unfair to pick ANY characters from so many, but I thought those two particularly splendid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite pearls of filmmaking, disappointing to the faithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Fellowship fully expecting to hate it. I love the books and have read them countless times and know the plots, characters, and even the back stories from Simarillion. Therefore, as I had never seen a book-made-movie that didn't butcher the original, I was ready to rant against the movie. But a funny thing happened: I LOVED IT. Though there were small changes and even large changes, Fellowship stayed true to the vision of Tolkien and brought the story to life quite fantastically.Having made all three movies at the same time, I am astounded that Jackson could have hit a homerun with one and failed so miserably (and blatantly) to follow through on Two Towers. I don't deny that it was visually stunning and, if I hadn't read the books I probably would have adored Towers more than Fellowship. And I also believe that much of the movie was wonderful and stayed true to Tolkien's vision. However, there were glaring aberrations that frankly ruined the movie for me.First and foremost was the TERRIBLE portrayal of Faramir's character. The entire plot of that storyline was changed. Faramir is in Ithilien precisely because he was nothing like his brother Boromir. He never attempts to take the ring, and in fact in the book he makes a point of saying that he knows how corrupting it is - Faramir as a character is closest to Aragorn in temperament. He aids Frodo and Sam on their way, despite knowing that his father (Denethor the Steward of Gondor) will hate him for it. Incidentally, the premise that he takes Frodo and Sam all the way to Osgiliath, where the Wraith sees Frodo and Frodo nearly gives him the ring is absurd, as Sauron would have sent every resource at his command to get the ring at that point - Frodo and Sam's only hope is that Sauron doesn't notice them!)Frankly, I have to say I could have lived much more easily with the other changes: elves at Helm's Deep, the decision to have Aragorn nearly die and appear at the last moment, and the back story of Arwen and Elrond (which ends, bizarrely, with Arwen leaving for the Grey Havens???!!! - I'm interested to see how Jackson extracts her from that), if the prior complaint hadn't made the other changes that more glaring. Unlike some, I understand why Towers did not end with Shelob and the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Orthanc - Return of the King is actually the shortest of the books in text (much of the printed book is actually appendices), and I find it plausible that these issues can be addressed satisfactorily in the next movie (though, if they are omitted at that point I will be sorely disappointed).All told, this is a movie that is good for folks who do not remember the book well, have not read the book, and/or don't really care about Tolkien's vision one whit. I plan to see it again to take it in without the horrified shock I experienced during my first viewing, but I really don't understand why Jackson strayed so far - in many places where the original story added much more depth and would not have detracted from the excitement of the movie or required any additional explanation.I still hold out hope for the final movie, as there were so many pearls in this movie (the Ent's razing of Orthanc was spectacular, the actors portrayed the characters with passion and heart, Gollum was fantastically conceived, and the schizophrenic nature of the book was nicely woven together), but on the whole I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be brief. I have not read any of the books, nor have a seen any of the television previews for this movie, so this was the first time I quite literally was at the edge of my seat! This movie rocked! My favourite part was when the ents finally assaulted Eisenguard, broke the dam, and watching all of Saruman's minions, and thus his dream of conquest, flush down the drain. The look of his face made me smile. I had no idea about the outcome of the battle of Helms Deep. In fact, I thought they were going to loose! After all, the track record about winning and losing in this series is fairly balanced. This was a true feel good movie, with a moral that even if there is few good in this world, it is worth fighting for.Also, with all the readers complaining how Peter Jackson hasn't kept to the book, remember that he is there to film a movie, not film a book. Why can't you critique the movie on its own?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals, disappointing story changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While marveling at the astounding visuals presented in "The Two Towers", I could not help but be somewhat chagrined at the alterations to the original story line. Having been a Tolkien fan since the mid 1960s, and having read all of his writings, I could not but watch the movie with the hope of seeing a screen rendition to the original book. In the first film, "The Fellowship of the Ring", I was disappointed with the story changes, but saw the wisdom of them in light of the mission of making a movie of reasonable length which would also appeal to those unfamiliar with the original writings. In the second installment, "The Two Towers", I expected some abridgement of the story and the occasional addition or alteration for cinematic necessity. However, what I did in fact see, were some wholesale alterations to the story that did not seem to serve any cinematic purpose. The change in the story concerning the actions of the Ents was no shorter or clearer than a true rendering of the story would have been. The same was true with the banishment of Eomer, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn and the encounter between Frodo and Faramir (especially Faramir's kidnapping of Frodo to Osgiliath and the ridiculous encounter between Frodo and the flying Ringwraith there). Yes, the evil influence of the ring may have been somewhat more emphatic with the story changes, but this is more than offset by the loss of emphasis on Frodo's role in the story. If you are a fan of Tolkien's vision, I think that you should still go see the movie; changes notwithstanding. It is a visual masterpiece, especially the CGI Gollum. However, I think that it was Roger Ebert (in his review in the "Chicago Sun Times") who stated things best: "To do what he (Peter Jackson) has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dividing fans down the middle again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the books in the same near-religious manner as Christopher Lee since I was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). So for the better part of twenty years, I have been immersed in the world of Tolkien and his characters. The simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story.The novel is often a confused tome. Events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. In spite of being the shortest volume in the series, The Two Towers takes the longest time to read. Partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because Tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. Even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people I've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is.I also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell Arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the Tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with Aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. This is actually a very good move. All we read about Arwen is a few sentences (if that) in The Fellowship Of The Ring, then maybe a chapter or two in The Return Of The King. The appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but Tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that Aragorn would choose a seemingly docile Elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. The film fixes this by making Arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been.Now where do I begin in describing the film? My only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. But aside from these problems, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Elrond stops telling people "YOU must do this, YOU must destroy that", drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving Middle-Earth while it is in such peril. And where do I begin with Gollum? We've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to George Lucas, but Gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. He gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes.Treebeard and his fellow Ents are little different. They look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of Tolkien to the viewer. Seeing the early stage of their battle in Isengard, I fully understood the meaning of one of the Sindarin themes in the score music. The English translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like "The forest has declared war", and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. Speaking of the score music, Gollum's Song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. With lyrics like "Don't say I didn't try" or "We are lost, we can never go home", it puts the viewer/listener in Gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while.You might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises.At first I was a bit perplexed by the ending. The novel ends with Shelob poisoing Frodo and Frodo being taken by Orcs while Sam takes the Ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with Gollum muttering to himself about how "she" will take care of those nasty, tricksy little Hobbitses. However, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how Shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what Gollum is on about now. And more than anything, the changes in expression on Gollum's face as the Halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between Frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to Gollum by Sam and the Men Of Gondor. As the film ends, and the credits roll over Gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience.To cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. They will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying "goo-goo gaa-gaa" for two and a half hours at them. Who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. Yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is without any doubt the ultimate showcase of how good cinema can get. Not only is Towers a worthy extenstion of the first instalment, Fellowship, but it is a stand alone thrill ride of cinematic genius.Without warning, without any form of reminder or any chance of catching ones breath, Peter Jackson thrusts us right back into the world of middle-earth and right back into his daring and exciting form of film-making. Unlike most sequals (I guess you can't really call this a sequal) Towers is a completely different and unique film from the first. Towers presents a darker more unforgiving Mddle-earth and is unquestionably a war epic of truly incredible proportions.Watching the film the energy that oozes off the screen in the extremely fast paced and action packed three hours gives you a bizz that many people would relate as the feeling they had when watching The Empire Strikes Back for the first time all those years ago. The chemistry between each character, aided undoubtedly by the first film is electric and every scene serves to advance the film in a positive and entertaining direction. One weeps at the sheer brilliance of the films complex construction and near perfect cinematic execution. This is the stuff dreams are made of, this is the stuff that shapes the way forward in the future of film.Towers is not without flaw, with a screen time limit of three hours much of the book has been cut and changed much to the displeasure of many fans and purists. Still the film stands alone all by itself as grand cinema regardless of how prescious the book is. There are some very obvious computer aided effects, especially when watching the Ents, but these are over shadowed by the sheer joy derived form the events on screen. Peter succeeds where most special effects directors fail, he suspends disbelief so that even the most fake of creations is missed as the audience gets sucked into the events on screen. Speaking of special effects, Gollum/Smeagol will undoubtedly go down in history as the very first succesful completely computer generated characters on film. Yes he is obviously created by a computer, but he looks far better than anything else that has ever been presented and the character itself is an absolute treat and completely steels the show. The emotional high point of the film is stolen by Gollum in his two he scenes where he speaks quite disturbingly to himself as each other alter ego.The acting is all very sifficient and definately above average for any film of this style. Special credits should go to Brad Dourif as Wormtounge who is as evil and cunning as the genius of Peters vision, Elijah as Frodo and Sean as Sam who as a pair make for a great on screen plutonic chemistry defining a lost art of male comradeship, and of course Any Serkis as Gollum.The film is often very light hearted as John-Rhys Davis discards his sombre Dwarf character Gimli from the first film and settles in as the comic-relief, this is a sharp contrast to the films very dark themes. People die, limbs are hacked, the world falls apart around them, but all the while Peter remains focussed on the task at hand and delivers Tolkiens message with the edge that only he can.The Films three climaxes, the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Trashing of isengard and the Siege at Osgilith would all be a single fitting end to any epic film, and then the film leaves you breathless and wanting more... Such torture - if the ending to Fellowship had you wanting more, this willhave you tearing out the seats at the cinema in riot that you have to wait another year... Still to behold the scene at Helm's Deep will be enough, no words can describe this except to say that it is the biggest most spectacular battle on screen and will not fail tpo satify.These films are looking to be the defining trilogy of this century and are certainly groundbreaking near perfect cinema. This once weeped for a good portion of the film, I can only hope the experience is as good as that for everyone else. Peter Jackson, Heres to you and yours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why don't they make producers put disclaimers on movie posters like they do with cigarettes and prescription drugs that could have potentially negative side effects? Something like "Based very loosely on the book of the same title but don't get your hopes up" would have been appreciated. Then at least I could have waited for the DVD rental and not been duped out of the full price of a movie ticket. I felt really cheated after having seen this Disneyfied crapfest that relied heavily on special effects to give it the momentum it otherwise lacked. People who love literature just need to get used to the fact that American filmakers will never trust the American public enough to make a film that is true to the literature that inspired the film. If you don't have a problem with not being true to the original creation then this ranks up there with any other special effects extravaganza. This film lacked the passion and the nobility of the book. The characters said and did things that were not in the book and that went completely against the grain of the book. On a positive note, I'm glad Tolkein himself didn't have to see this parody. He would have been insulted.</fullReview>

If you don't have a problem with not being true to the original creation then this ranks up there with any other special effects extravaganza. This film lacked the passion and the nobility of the book. The characters said and did things that were not in the book and that went completely against the grain of the book. On a positive note, I'm glad Tolkein himself didn't have to see this parody. He would have been insulted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valiant attempt, but falls a little short in my i's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Tolkien's literary craftsmanship. His depth with words and languages was truly a gift to the world as presented in the LOTR masterpiece. A hindrance this presents itself as, in Jacksons LOTR: The Two Towers. In reviewing this movie it is very important for me to detach myself from having read the fantasy novel.That said, the stand-alone film is FILLED with tons of eye candy which is done very well... par for course, however, with today's technology and it is as good as anything out there. The cinematography didn't catch my eye as much as Fellowship did... Yes the Two Towers looks very nice, but I felt that Fellowship captured Tolkien's world a bit better in my eyes.Many new characters are introduced into the story very quickly and their brevity on-screen may have non-readers of the novel leaving the theater scratching their heads... A few examples: Wormtongue (cheesy I thought), Faramir (big deal, he's Boromir's brother, who excuses the captured hobbits before you find out too much about him), the Oliphant (in the movie, as I recall, the first time we see it is when Sam says "Look the Oliphant"... who cares). A way this could have been done better in my opinion, would have been to introduce things properly and give them a little time to grow on the screen. This would add a little time to the film, but some heli-cam shots from afar could easily be edited out in an effort to develop the characters a little bit better. Character development could be tightened.And Gollum, cheesy in my eyes. As cool as Yoda was in Episode 2. Oh and Gollum, he's probably the best villain in modern literature... Because he evokes sympathy among viewers/readers... A human emotion that we can all relate to. He represents the dark side of man... Addiction and acting upon that addiction. Not sure that the filmakers captured that concept.All aside, if you've read the novel, you should not like the ending of this film as I don't. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I'd love to rant about what was added and what left out (being very fond of Tolkien's works), that hardly seems worthwhile. For two reasons: anyone should know that all that can be put into film of a book like this is spectacle, and for filming purposes some things must be altered. One should never expect a movie to do complete justice to a book (what would be the point of reading it, then?). Secondly, so much was changed that it would be exhausting to try and discuss it all. Really, if you're going to re-write The Lord of the Rings (which is essentially what happened in this movie), call it something else, and do a good job. My criticism of this movie is based solely on its merit as a movie. I would give it 6 out of 10, for being incoherant, boring, and a really long non sequitor with a badly written script. The few things that are good about it (gollum being one) are so overshadowed by the absurdity of what goes on in the gruesomely plodding and confusing plotline as to be immemorable. I never want to see this again, not because it was dissapointing as compared to The Fellowship, but because it was simply an incredibly poor movie. Attack of the Clones was more enjoyable as far as being able to follow the action- and I like Star Trek! The proof that this movie was abyssmally bad: comic-relief Gimli hands it out in the form of getting an orc between the legs during a battle. Boo, Mr. Jackson, boo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the second part in the trilogy picks up from where the first left off, and i liked peter jackson's decision not to include any sort of retrospective of the fellowship of the ring. it wouldn't have felt right, and who didn't see the first movie anyway? that having been said, the movie does do a wonderful job of translating tolkien's novel to the screen, with some largely excusable (forgive me, lotr purists) alterations. cinematically, it largely works, though the relentless pace can get a little confusing. but the director had the difficult task in this movie of fusing together three independent storylines, and he manages it pretty successfully in the end. the casting was inspired. the actors all get into their characters and are really fun to watch, especially, of course, the one who doesn't appear on screen at all - andy serkis, who was digitized into the creature gollum on screen, turns in a simply remarkable performance as the schizophrenic gollum. the scenery and backgrounds are stunning, the battle scenes are choreographed to perfection, and above all, the movie manages to capture the essence (and not every nuance, but i'm sure the author would have understood) of the lord of the rings. the timeless struggle between good and evil, light and dark, free will and slavery, it's all there, larger than life. this is a movie that will remain with you for a long, long time. go ahead and watch it in theaters while you still can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how so many millions of people can be obsessed with this movie. I was looking so forward to "the fellowship" and it let me down. Then the buzz on "the two towers" was great, so I had high hopes for it. I haven't been this let down from a movie in a long time. I can promise you I won't be in line for "the return of the king". First of all the whole movie was basically made on computer which takes out all the realism. Beside the action, the story was just boring. And that's not giving the action a thumbs up. You've got 10,000 of these huge beasts marching towards this "fort knox" type castle, against 300 or so people. Yet when the fighting starts, rarely do you see any of the 10,000 beasts killing anything. Instead, Aragon rides through them like a hot knife through butter without a scratch. Come on, that's just awful. The movie completely relies on eyecandy, which is not how to make a movie. What happened to great movies with a great story and great dialogue. I'm looking very much forward to the day when the last of the lord of the rings series is out of our minds and out of the media. Terrible movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into great details about all of the aspects of the film. I found it extremely enjoyable - and not having read this book or The Return of the King I was somewhat apprehensive that I'd feel lost. That wasn't the case at all - I was engrossed for the entire three hours, and I particularly enjoyed seeing the further development of characters not given much screen time in the first film - particularly Legolas and Gimli. I found the characters of Merry and Pippin to have grown tremendously, as well. The absolute best part of the experience for me, however, was going to see the film with my husband and two boys, ages 16 &amp; 12. Our twelve year old read the book this past Summer and was really excited about the film going in. For the entire three hours he stayed literally on the edge of his seat - I'm not sure his back ever touched the chair. The look on his face and his body language spoke volumes - this film (as well as FOTR) will hold forever in his memory as great movie experiences. And that alone made it well worth the time spent and the price of admission.</fullReview>

I don't think he will disappoint us at all in The Return of the King. The Two Towers was, naturally, much darker than the first, and more filled with despair, and yet there is humor in it (dear old Gimli, and Sam as well) and the action climax is amazing! Plus there is added things not from the books between Arwen and Aragorn that show the immense struggle the future holds for them. On the whole, it's AWESOME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tolkien wrote a wonderful story; full of magic and wonder and valor and all those little elements that make an adventure book wonderful.Now, Jackson has made a brilliant adaptation of the book into a motion picture, full of magic and wonder and valor and all the elements that make an adventure movie wonderful.All the naysaying Tolkienites who criticize the movie need to get over themselves. I'd like to see them do better. True, the movie strayed from certain major details in the book, but what movie adapted from a book hasn't? Plus, all of the changes are not profane at all to the ends or themes of the books. If Jackson had spent as much time as most die-hard Ring fans would have him, the movie would be 9 hours long and would appeal only to those die-hard fans. I actually reviewed the chapters of the books, and he never strayed from the central, critical idea at all. I see a great culmination in "The Return of the King" coming together quite nicely.Additionally, The CGI is unreal. The Ents and Gollum are especially wonderful, and the battle scenes--although sometimes hard to follow--are especially elegant and crafty. Jackson in no way sacrificed character depth for graphics and imagery in the character of Gollum. In fact, Gollum's character deserves a nomination for best supporting actor.Jackson knows what he is doing here. He's cunning and brilliant, and to the distraught Tokienites who would have him beheaded, I say TTT is worthy of the "Best Picture" Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you or have you not read the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, all!I am in the FORTUNATE position to not only have READ all three LOTR books several times, and seen The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) NUMEROUS times AND The Two Towers (TTT) a few already, but ALSO loving both the books and the films. Listed below are a few ideas I think a few of you critics need to think about.1) Cliche as it is to say, if LOTR was turned into a film COMPLETELY after the books, it would have been about 36 hours long, if not more. Impossible. Some things need to be cut.2) LOTR are the best books I've ever read. THEY ARE STILL BORING AT TIMES. You cannot tell me that you want to see Sam and Frodo walking through Emyn Muil and the Dead Marshes for as long as they do in TTT? In that case you should consider seeing a shrink! I haven't seen anyone complaining about all the songs and poems being cut out in the films.3) The films need to be presented in a way that not only introduces LOTR to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the books, but to create a justifiable storyline and a visualization of LOTR to its readers and fans. That's a difficult job. LOTR: the films are NOT for its fans and readers only, NOR is it for the people who haven't heard of LOTR/read the books. It's for EVERYONE! And in terms of that, it could properly not have done better.OK, now I would like to say that yeah, as a fan of the books I have my pointers to the films, Why wasn't Tom Bombadil in the films? Why does Aragorn almost die in TTT? Why doesn't Sam look into the mirror of Galadriel? Why does Boromir die in the first film and not the second? Where is Shelob? But the point is, NOBODY CARES!!! We know all this, cause we've read the books. It's what we call INTERESTING/ADDITIONAL information. The people who haven't, DON'T CARE, they'll never know! So in this way, everybody is happy. But it does create a loophole for another question I think is more interesting: Why all the made-up stuff? Well, it is simply necessary to gain as large an audience as possible, and as stated above, THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE FILM, to be for EVERYBODY!I am sick of people saying that Peter Jackson is a bad director. The shots are fantastic, the actors (which have been directed) are doing a REALLY good job, the tenseness, which of course is different from person to person, is higher than in many other films, and the film has a feeling of art about it.I am sick of people who have read the books and complain about the film being crap and not doing the books justice, when they themselves can't be bothered to spell characters' names correctly. Go be miserable on your own while we others have fun. It's your loss.I am sick of people complaining about holes in the story when they simply haven't understood something. Gandalf becomes the white because he earned that title by killing the Balrog of Morgoth. DO SOME SIMPLE, FUN, EASY RESEARCH, read the books, or even easier: Listen to what the characters in the film are saying. Please don't put your stupidity on display like that.Guys and Gals, in the end, if you read the books, and then see the films, you'll know everything, you should be able to appreciate everything, and if you only want to see the films, that's fine, you're in for a long movie which should entertain you till the end. If you only want to read the books, that's fine as well, but more than anything, Peter Jackson's films are SUPPORTING Tolkien's work, not destroying it, not building on it, not overshadowing it. Supporting it. Giving it a new glance. And that, they do magnificently well.If you like the films, I feel sorry for you, for not being able to be done to, but I also respect your opinion, just make sense. And make sure that it makes sense to you, and that you're not just trying to be different, or trying to be critical. The LOTR films are too good to be spoiled in that way.The books are always going to be the ultimate work of Tolkien, and they will always be the best, if you need them to be. The films still complement the books, in the same way that the books complement the film.Remember that your vision may not be the same as Peter Jackson's. That does not mean that either of you are wrong. It just means he had the money and power to show everyone his ideas, but that shouldn't matter to you. Keep yours, and make them what they are to you, but accept Jackson's as another vision, as fit to exist as yours.I, for one, cannot wait until The Return Of The King (ROTK), when the trilogy will be completed, and in the meantime, I'll have fun reading Tolkien's masterpieces (while skipping over the boring bits, like we all do ;o).Enjoy the art.Monroe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Towering Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike last year, I am reviewing the new installment of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Not that I failed to enjoy `Fellowship of the Ring'-I found it to be an excellent example of the re-emergence of the epic and it was just plain fun. I had similar hopes heading into `Two Towers' and you know what, I was pretty much dead-on.`Two Towers' opens with proof that the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), my favorite character from the first installment, has not died a fiery death in the mines of Moriah, which certainly gladdened my heart. But that is just one of the four separate storylines that exists to enhance the plot (and make my summarization a much more difficult task).In plotline number two, a pair of our plucky Hobbit protagonists, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his companion, Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are traveling closer to the ultimate destination-Mt. Doom, the only place where the frighteningly powerful Ring of Power can be destroyed. But in a deal that falls as close to a deal with the devil, Frodo and Sam enlist the aid of the schizophrenic Gollum (Andy Serkis) to guide them to the fiery mount.The third plotline involves the other two Hobbits of the story-Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). After being kidnapped by vicious Uruk-Hai, the intrepid Halflings escape into the foreboding Fangorn Forest, where they are taken for a ride (literally) by an Ent-a tree-shepherd of the forest.The fourth and most dwelled upon plotline focuses on the three remaining heroes-the human uber-warrior, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the waggish dwarf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and the talented elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). To make what could be a long story short, this band of heroes comes to the aid of the embattled nation of Rohan, ruled by the wise (though sometimes misguided) Theoden (Bernard Hill). The quest of these heroes culminates in the spectacular battle of Helm's Deep.The thing that struck me the most about the movie was the jaw-dropping visuals. Combining amazing camera work and amazingly realistic special effects, the film was an absolute feast for the eyes. The only flaw that I readily noticed was in the shots of the two Hobbits riding atop the Ent-it seemed to be shot out of the 1950s, not the 21st Century, but one flaw out of three hours of film is a pretty good success rate.I may sound masochistic to say this (especially after consuming a cup of soda), but I think that the film could have been easily stretched another half-hour. Too much seems to be crammed into a relatively short three hours-not that I'm being nit-picky here. The plot already is excellent, but if it could possibly be stretched out to allow more development to each character, I'd be ecstatic. Well, maybe I'll just have to wait and see an unedited version on DVD.The acting was magnificent and I really had nothing against any of the performances, although if I were to pick out one weak point in the acting is in Sean Astin's character's speech to Frodo towards the end-a bit schmaltzy if you ask me.Overall, I was breathless after the splendor of `The Two Towers.' This, despite the myriad of special effects (which actually WORK here-as opposed to other films), is what a movie is supposed to be. If a few flaws were corrected and the movie stretched out a little bit, it would be a 10; as is, I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you or have you not read the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, all!I am in the FORTUNATE position to not only have READ all three LOTR books several times, and seen The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) NUMEROUS times AND The Two Towers (TTT) a few already, but ALSO loving both the books and the films. Listed below are a few ideas I think a few of you critics need to think about.1) Cliche as it is to say, if LOTR was turned into a film COMPLETELY after the books, it would have been about 36 hours long, if not more. Impossible. Some things need to be cut.2) LOTR are the best books I've ever read. THEY ARE STILL BORING AT TIMES. You cannot tell me that you want to see Sam and Frodo walking through Emyn Muil and the Dead Marshes for as long as they do in TTT? In that case you should consider seeing a shrink! I haven't seen anyone complaining about all the songs and poems being cut out in the films.3) The films need to be presented in a way that not only introduces LOTR to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the books, but to create a justifiable storyline and a visualization of LOTR to its readers and fans. That's a difficult job. LOTR: the films are NOT for its fans and readers only, NOR is it for the people who haven't heard of LOTR/read the books. It's for EVERYONE! And in terms of that, it could properly not have done better.OK, now I would like to say that yeah, as a fan of the books I have my pointers to the films, Why wasn't Tom Bombadil in the films? Why does Aragorn almost die in TTT? Why doesn't Sam look into the mirror of Galadriel? Why does Boromir die in the first film and not the second? Where is Shelob? But the point is, NOBODY CARES!!! We know all this, cause we've read the books. It's what we call INTERESTING/ADDITIONAL information. The people who haven't, DON'T CARE, they'll never know! So in this way, everybody is happy. But it does create a loophole for another question I think is more interesting: Why all the made-up stuff? Well, it is simply necessary to gain as large an audience as possible, and as stated above, THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE FILM, to be for EVERYBODY!I am sick of people saying that Peter Jackson is a bad director. The shots are fantastic, the actors (which have been directed) are doing a REALLY good job, the tenseness, which of course is different from person to person, is higher than in many other films, and the film has a feeling of art about it.I am sick of people who have read the books and complain about the film being crap and not doing the books justice, when they themselves can't be bothered to spell characters' names correctly. Go be miserable on your own while we others have fun. It's your loss.I am sick of people complaining about holes in the story when they simply haven't understood something. Gandalf becomes the white because he earned that title by killing the Balrog of Morgoth. DO SOME SIMPLE, FUN, EASY RESEARCH, read the books, or even easier: Listen to what the characters in the film are saying. Please don't put your stupidity on display like that.Guys and Gals, in the end, if you read the books, and then see the films, you'll know everything, you should be able to appreciate everything, and if you only want to see the films, that's fine, you're in for a long movie which should entertain you till the end. If you only want to read the books, that's fine as well, but more than anything, Peter Jackson's films are SUPPORTING Tolkien's work, not destroying it, not building on it, not overshadowing it. Supporting it. Giving it a new glance. And that, they do magnificently well.If you like the films, I feel sorry for you, for not being able to be done to, but I also respect your opinion, just make sense. And make sure that it makes sense to you, and that you're not just trying to be different, or trying to be critical. The LOTR films are too good to be spoiled in that way.The books are always going to be the ultimate work of Tolkien, and they will always be the best, if you need them to be. The films still complement the books, in the same way that the books complement the film.Remember that your vision may not be the same as Peter Jackson's. That does not mean that either of you are wrong. It just means he had the money and power to show everyone his ideas, but that shouldn't matter to you. Keep yours, and make them what they are to you, but accept Jackson's as another vision, as fit to exist as yours.I, for one, cannot wait until The Return Of The King (ROTK), when the trilogy will be completed, and in the meantime, I'll have fun reading Tolkien's masterpieces (while skipping over the boring bits, like we all do ;o).Enjoy the art.Monroe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Towering Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike last year, I am reviewing the new installment of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Not that I failed to enjoy `Fellowship of the Ring'-I found it to be an excellent example of the re-emergence of the epic and it was just plain fun. I had similar hopes heading into `Two Towers' and you know what, I was pretty much dead-on.`Two Towers' opens with proof that the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), my favorite character from the first installment, has not died a fiery death in the mines of Moriah, which certainly gladdened my heart. But that is just one of the four separate storylines that exists to enhance the plot (and make my summarization a much more difficult task).In plotline number two, a pair of our plucky Hobbit protagonists, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his companion, Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are traveling closer to the ultimate destination-Mt. Doom, the only place where the frighteningly powerful Ring of Power can be destroyed. But in a deal that falls as close to a deal with the devil, Frodo and Sam enlist the aid of the schizophrenic Gollum (Andy Serkis) to guide them to the fiery mount.The third plotline involves the other two Hobbits of the story-Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). After being kidnapped by vicious Uruk-Hai, the intrepid Halflings escape into the foreboding Fangorn Forest, where they are taken for a ride (literally) by an Ent-a tree-shepherd of the forest.The fourth and most dwelled upon plotline focuses on the three remaining heroes-the human uber-warrior, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the waggish dwarf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and the talented elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). To make what could be a long story short, this band of heroes comes to the aid of the embattled nation of Rohan, ruled by the wise (though sometimes misguided) Theoden (Bernard Hill). The quest of these heroes culminates in the spectacular battle of Helm's Deep.The thing that struck me the most about the movie was the jaw-dropping visuals. Combining amazing camera work and amazingly realistic special effects, the film was an absolute feast for the eyes. The only flaw that I readily noticed was in the shots of the two Hobbits riding atop the Ent-it seemed to be shot out of the 1950s, not the 21st Century, but one flaw out of three hours of film is a pretty good success rate.I may sound masochistic to say this (especially after consuming a cup of soda), but I think that the film could have been easily stretched another half-hour. Too much seems to be crammed into a relatively short three hours-not that I'm being nit-picky here. The plot already is excellent, but if it could possibly be stretched out to allow more development to each character, I'd be ecstatic. Well, maybe I'll just have to wait and see an unedited version on DVD.The acting was magnificent and I really had nothing against any of the performances, although if I were to pick out one weak point in the acting is in Sean Astin's character's speech to Frodo towards the end-a bit schmaltzy if you ask me.Overall, I was breathless after the splendor of `The Two Towers.' This, despite the myriad of special effects (which actually WORK here-as opposed to other films), is what a movie is supposed to be. If a few flaws were corrected and the movie stretched out a little bit, it would be a 10; as is, I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go back to the shadow, Peter Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I'd love to rant about what was added and what left out (being very fond of Tolkien's works), that hardly seems worthwhile. For two reasons: anyone should know that all that can be put into film of a book like this is spectacle, and for filming purposes some things must be altered. One should never expect a movie to do complete justice to a book (what would be the point of reading it, then?). Secondly, so much was changed that it would be exhausting to try and discuss it all. Really, if you're going to re-write The Lord of the Rings (which is essentially what happened in this movie), call it something else, and do a good job. My criticism of this movie is based solely on its merit as a movie. I would give it 6 out of 10, for being incoherant, boring, and a really long non sequitor with a badly written script. The few things that are good about it (gollum being one) are so overshadowed by the absurdity of what goes on in the gruesomely plodding and confusing plotline as to be immemorable. I never want to see this again, not because it was dissapointing as compared to The Fellowship, but because it was simply an incredibly poor movie. Attack of the Clones was more enjoyable as far as being able to follow the action- and I like Star Trek! The proof that this movie was abyssmally bad: comic-relief Gimli hands it out in the form of getting an orc between the legs during a battle. Boo, Mr. Jackson, boo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the second part in the trilogy picks up from where the first left off, and i liked peter jackson's decision not to include any sort of retrospective of the fellowship of the ring. it wouldn't have felt right, and who didn't see the first movie anyway? that having been said, the movie does do a wonderful job of translating tolkien's novel to the screen, with some largely excusable (forgive me, lotr purists) alterations. cinematically, it largely works, though the relentless pace can get a little confusing. but the director had the difficult task in this movie of fusing together three independent storylines, and he manages it pretty successfully in the end. the casting was inspired. the actors all get into their characters and are really fun to watch, especially, of course, the one who doesn't appear on screen at all - andy serkis, who was digitized into the creature gollum on screen, turns in a simply remarkable performance as the schizophrenic gollum. the scenery and backgrounds are stunning, the battle scenes are choreographed to perfection, and above all, the movie manages to capture the essence (and not every nuance, but i'm sure the author would have understood) of the lord of the rings. the timeless struggle between good and evil, light and dark, free will and slavery, it's all there, larger than life. this is a movie that will remain with you for a long, long time. go ahead and watch it in theaters while you still can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With most of the characters plotted out, this film was able to just let the action rip. There was more than just action but at no time was there a drop in interest for what was on the screen. The graphics were seamless; Costumes wonderful and I don't think I've ever seen more realistic scum on an Orc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film; not to be degraded by the naysaying Tolkienites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tolkien wrote a wonderful story; full of magic and wonder and valor and all those little elements that make an adventure book wonderful.Now, Jackson has made a brilliant adaptation of the book into a motion picture, full of magic and wonder and valor and all the elements that make an adventure movie wonderful.All the naysaying Tolkienites who criticize the movie need to get over themselves. I'd like to see them do better. True, the movie strayed from certain major details in the book, but what movie adapted from a book hasn't? Plus, all of the changes are not profane at all to the ends or themes of the books. If Jackson had spent as much time as most die-hard Ring fans would have him, the movie would be 9 hours long and would appeal only to those die-hard fans. I actually reviewed the chapters of the books, and he never strayed from the central, critical idea at all. I see a great culmination in "The Return of the King" coming together quite nicely.Additionally, The CGI is unreal. The Ents and Gollum are especially wonderful, and the battle scenes--although sometimes hard to follow--are especially elegant and crafty. Jackson in no way sacrificed character depth for graphics and imagery in the character of Gollum. In fact, Gollum's character deserves a nomination for best supporting actor.Jackson knows what he is doing here. He's cunning and brilliant, and to the distraught Tokienites who would have him beheaded, I say TTT is worthy of the "Best Picture" Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you people nuts? what's with the 9.1 average rating? Not a good movie at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I"m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings ahead of?ahead of the....Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic moviesI mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, "Did I gain anything from watching this movie?" The answer is no2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS.In my opinion, FOTR was a brilliant film. I rated it a 10.0 here (the Extended DVD version). For me, as for many others, it laid to rest any doubts that Peter Jackson could pull off the impossible and create a truly worthy, magnificent film version of LOTR, one which even Tolkien would likely have been proud. I honestly must say that after viewing The Two Towers, those doubts have returned for me.When I left the theatre after having viewed FOTR for the first time, I had a few quibbles about PJ's interpretation, but in general I felt thrilled and elated and raring to see it again. This time I came out feeling let down and a little short-changed and wanting to see it again just to give it the benefit of the doubt.Part of this reaction was because I had read too many advanced reviews which built my expectations too high. And part of it was because, as so many others have pointed out, TTT is more of an action/battle novel while FOTR was very character/quest driven.But these rationalizations are letting PJ off the hook too easily. In my opinion, he released a product that could have been significantly better, given the time he had to complete it.Like others who have criticized TTT, I felt that Jackson gave short shrift to the hobbits, particularly Merry and Pippen. I loved the banter between M &amp; P that existed in FOTR. In TTT, the two basically just sat on Treebeard's arms with their mouths agape. What didn't help was that the CGI quality of the Ent sequences was well below that of the rest of the movie. I've read that Jackson cut ou a lot of Ent material(the Ent draught scene in particular), material that will likely go back into the extended DVD, so this might help things. And he'll probably work on improving the quality of the animation renderings as well (he did that in the first movie).I felt that Frodo's characterization was surprisingly weak. At the end of FOTR, Frodo was resolute as he viewed the plains of Mordor. At the beginning of TTT, he appeared already half-delirious from the influence of the ring. The passage of time was not just rushed; it was non-existent.Also as countless others have stated, I felt that Faramir was shortchanged to some degree. He was a more noble, likeable character in the novel. But frankly, the change wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected. He was not a clone of Boromir. Having just reread the book, I would challenge anyone to prove that PJ's characterization of Faramir was that far off the mark. Yes he was portrayed as more cold and distant than he appeared in Tolkien's novel, but not by any stretch did he covet the ring as did Boromir. Nor did I find the trip to Osgiliath particularly objectionable.IMO, these criticisms are relatively minor compared to my main criticism: that the ending was a butchered edit job. A build-up of two hours to the battle of Helms Deep emphasizing the Rohirrim's feeling of despair and utter hopelessness of being vastly outnumbered, a great sequence of battle scenes, and then in the space of 5 minutes, it's over. Gandalf appears on Shadowfax on a hillside, and the Uruk Hai basically run for their lives. Ten thousand creatures that 'don't know pain, don't know fear' turn tail at the site of 300 men on horseback. That's not the way it happened in the book. It was the Huorn (trees) that saved the day. I guess Jackson felt that it was too much to ask the viewing audience to accept the Ents/trees saving the day twice (Helms Deep and Isengard). That thinking in itself is OK. But he could have drawn out the fighting sequences after Gandalf and the Rohirrim appeared. The battle was simply over too quickly.Worse, the climax with Gandalf was treated almost as an aside. The scene of the wizard and the riders of Rohan charging down the mountain was not even presented in 'real time' in the movie. Instead it was simply a backdrop to Sam's hokey motivational speech to Frodo. The intermingled scenes of Gandalf and the Ent's flooding of Isengard played second fiddle to this speech, which frankly was so corny, I cringed a little in my seat.Even worse, the final ending scenes paled in their impact compared to that in FOTR. I don't buy the excuse that this had to be because TTT was the middle movie. The end of FOTR was beautifully and intelligently scripted and was very emotional. In particular, the scene with Frodo standing in silence on the banks of the river with the ring in his hand was one of the highlights of the movie for me, and one of the reasons why I could return to watching it again and again. In contrast, TTT just ENDS. There's no sense of suspense or drama. To me, it came across as if PJ was editing the movie, realized that it was 2 hours and 59 minutes long, and said to himself "Oh my god, I've only got one minute left! I'll just throw in this quick pan of Shelob's mountain and be done with it!" In my opinion, he should have continued the plot right up until the brink of the confrontation with Shelob.Two other minor criticisms: the make-up job on the pre-exorcised Theodin was way over the top. Yes, he was possessed. But couldn't Jackson had made the point more subtly? It's like he didn't trust the audience's intelligence and had to hit them over the head by turning Theodin into a caricature.And the confrontation of Frodo with the black rider on the back of the flying creature (not nearly as frighteningly rendered as the black horses in FOTR): why was that necessary? It undermined one of the main sources of suspense in Tolkien's novels: that Frodo and Sam manage to stay just outside the view of Mordor.For these reasons, I rate TTT an 8.0. And I think that's being generous. In fairness, I am going to see this movie again (but probably only once again, in contrast to the fifteen times that I have scene FOTR), mostly to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if my opinion of it improves upon further viewing.Also in fairness, I had let my expectations build to the point that the movie could not do anything but disappoint. After all, these two movies together represent possibly the greatest epic ever to be filmed, and the third is hopefully going to be a return to the quality of the first. Though I must admit that I now have some doubts, something I would NOT have said after seeing FOTR.Also, on the plus side, the animation of Gollum was IMHO just AWESOME. Makes Yoda and Jar Jar Binks (hate to even mention him) and Dobby seem like hand puppets.Bottom line: I cannot hide a sense of disappointment. The tribute to Tolkien and Jackson is that I regard this LOTR trilogy - and PJ's films - as a personal possession, and I have lost a little pride in that possession upon the first viewing of TTT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part of this epic trilogy has been masterfully crafted on film. I found myself deeply moved by the emotional richness of The Two Towers, though it be in darker spirits than the first.Acting was high caliber (for the most part) bringing each character's strengths and frailties to life. Gollum takes my Best Actor award as well as compliments on FX.Battle scenes were aplenty, if a little too fast-paced at times for my taste. Cinematography and score left little to be desired; though I wondered where "Lux Aeterna" resounded!Do not attempt to compare the book and the film too closely. They are different media, each with their own inherent strengths and failings. I feel Jackson did an excellent job of stitching together the complexities of this story in the ever-so-short time alloted, balancing well struggles both epic and personal. Most importantly, he captured the essence of looming despair and the undying flicker of hope that made The Two Towers my favorite in the trilogy.Oh, and if you do not shed tears when you see "Arwen's Mortal Love" sequence (as I like to call it), then you have not felt the movie, nor do you possess the capacity to appreciate pure cinematic bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I give a 7 out of 10. After reading the book I was just a bit disappointed because they left a lot but added scenes to make up for it. I was extremely dissappointed when I found out there would be no scene where Pippin looks in the Palantir.The characters have the same qualities. The comic releif goes towards Gimli, Gollum, Pippin, and Treebeard while the action aspects go to Legolas, Aragorn, Gandalf, Eomer, and Ugluk. The new characters are awesome and portray there wholes exactly like the book. Grima Wormtounge I have to say was the best.The Scenes that left you at the edge of you seat the most include: Helms Deep, The Black Gates, The Wargs, The Olipaunt, The Ents taking over Isengard, and Gandalf healing Theoden.Overall the movie was good but just needed the extra touches that Tolien describes in his excellent novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible and Brilliant! There are no other adjectives to describe the magnificence of this film! Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's truth to the screen, and I can't wait for Return of the King. This trilogy will quickly become one of the classic films of cinema history! I saw the flick three times on Opening Day, and will definitely be seeing it many more times! (And I obviously can't stop using exclamation marks!) The acting was superb! Elijah Wood just sucked all the energy out of me, because my heart went out to this poor hobbit over and over and over! What a talented young actor!

I did feel at times that a few of them were a little cartoony (Dark Crystal-ish even), but who knows what real walking talking trees look like! I felt that the movie WAS sorely lacking in Merry and Pippin scenes and action, and yet it worked. However, I do expect more in the DVD! :) The stunning eye candy that this movie throws at you is just reason enough to see it a million times, and the story is another million. the cast and crew definitely deserve all praise they get, because they have accomplished a masterpiece. Although I found that the music wasn't as memorable as the first, it picked up on all the beautiful themes and underscored all the emotion perfectly. I sat at the end of the credits and just yearned for Return of the King to be placed before me. One more year??? Yeah...we can do it. Incredible...did I mention that?</fullReview>

And part of it was because, as so many others have pointed out, TTT is more of an action/battle novel while FOTR was very character/quest driven.But these rationalizations are letting PJ off the hook too easily. In my opinion, he released a product that could have been significantly better, given the time he had to complete it.Like others who have criticized TTT, I felt that Jackson gave short shrift to the hobbits, particularly Merry and Pippen. I loved the banter between M &amp; P that existed in FOTR. In TTT, the two basically just sat on Treebeard's arms with their mouths agape. What didn't help was that the CGI quality of the Ent sequences was well below that of the rest of the movie. I've read that Jackson cut ou a lot of Ent material(the Ent draught scene in particular), material that will likely go back into the extended DVD, so this might help things. And he'll probably work on improving the quality of the animation renderings as well (he did that in the first movie).I felt that Frodo's characterization was surprisingly weak. At the end of FOTR, Frodo was resolute as he viewed the plains of Mordor. At the beginning of TTT, he appeared already half-delirious from the influence of the ring. The passage of time was not just rushed; it was non-existent.Also as countless others have stated, I felt that Faramir was shortchanged to some degree. He was a more noble, likeable character in the novel. But frankly, the change wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected. He was not a clone of Boromir. Having just reread the book, I would challenge anyone to prove that PJ's characterization of Faramir was that far off the mark. Yes he was portrayed as more cold and distant than he appeared in Tolkien's novel, but not by any stretch did he covet the ring as did Boromir. Nor did I find the trip to Osgiliath particularly objectionable.IMO, these criticisms are relatively minor compared to my main criticism: that the ending was a butchered edit job. A build-up of two hours to the battle of Helms Deep emphasizing the Rohirrim's feeling of despair and utter hopelessness of being vastly outnumbered, a great sequence of battle scenes, and then in the space of 5 minutes, it's over. Gandalf appears on Shadowfax on a hillside, and the Uruk Hai basically run for their lives. Ten thousand creatures that 'don't know pain, don't know fear' turn tail at the site of 300 men on horseback. That's not the way it happened in the book. It was the Huorn (trees) that saved the day. I guess Jackson felt that it was too much to ask the viewing audience to accept the Ents/trees saving the day twice (Helms Deep and Isengard). That thinking in itself is OK. But he could have drawn out the fighting sequences after Gandalf and the Rohirrim appeared. The battle was simply over too quickly.Worse, the climax with Gandalf was treated almost as an aside. The scene of the wizard and the riders of Rohan charging down the mountain was not even presented in 'real time' in the movie. Instead it was simply a backdrop to Sam's hokey motivational speech to Frodo. The intermingled scenes of Gandalf and the Ent's flooding of Isengard played second fiddle to this speech, which frankly was so corny, I cringed a little in my seat.Even worse, the final ending scenes paled in their impact compared to that in FOTR. I don't buy the excuse that this had to be because TTT was the middle movie. The end of FOTR was beautifully and intelligently scripted and was very emotional. In particular, the scene with Frodo standing in silence on the banks of the river with the ring in his hand was one of the highlights of the movie for me, and one of the reasons why I could return to watching it again and again. In contrast, TTT just ENDS. There's no sense of suspense or drama. To me, it came across as if PJ was editing the movie, realized that it was 2 hours and 59 minutes long, and said to himself "Oh my god, I've only got one minute left! I'll just throw in this quick pan of Shelob's mountain and be done with it!" In my opinion, he should have continued the plot right up until the brink of the confrontation with Shelob.Two other minor criticisms: the make-up job on the pre-exorcised Theodin was way over the top. Yes, he was possessed. But couldn't Jackson had made the point more subtly? It's like he didn't trust the audience's intelligence and had to hit them over the head by turning Theodin into a caricature.And the confrontation of Frodo with the black rider on the back of the flying creature (not nearly as frighteningly rendered as the black horses in FOTR): why was that necessary? It undermined one of the main sources of suspense in Tolkien's novels: that Frodo and Sam manage to stay just outside the view of Mordor.For these reasons, I rate TTT an 8.0. And I think that's being generous. In fairness, I am going to see this movie again (but probably only once again, in contrast to the fifteen times that I have scene FOTR), mostly to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if my opinion of it improves upon further viewing.Also in fairness, I had let my expectations build to the point that the movie could not do anything but disappoint. After all, these two movies together represent possibly the greatest epic ever to be filmed, and the third is hopefully going to be a return to the quality of the first. Though I must admit that I now have some doubts, something I would NOT have said after seeing FOTR.Also, on the plus side, the animation of Gollum was IMHO just AWESOME. Makes Yoda and Jar Jar Binks (hate to even mention him) and Dobby seem like hand puppets.Bottom line: I cannot hide a sense of disappointment. The tribute to Tolkien and Jackson is that I regard this LOTR trilogy - and PJ's films - as a personal possession, and I have lost a little pride in that possession upon the first viewing of TTT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part of this epic trilogy has been masterfully crafted on film. I found myself deeply moved by the emotional richness of The Two Towers, though it be in darker spirits than the first.Acting was high caliber (for the most part) bringing each character's strengths and frailties to life. Gollum takes my Best Actor award as well as compliments on FX.Battle scenes were aplenty, if a little too fast-paced at times for my taste. Cinematography and score left little to be desired; though I wondered where "Lux Aeterna" resounded!Do not attempt to compare the book and the film too closely. They are different media, each with their own inherent strengths and failings. I feel Jackson did an excellent job of stitching together the complexities of this story in the ever-so-short time alloted, balancing well struggles both epic and personal. Most importantly, he captured the essence of looming despair and the undying flicker of hope that made The Two Towers my favorite in the trilogy.Oh, and if you do not shed tears when you see "Arwen's Mortal Love" sequence (as I like to call it), then you have not felt the movie, nor do you possess the capacity to appreciate pure cinematic bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I give a 7 out of 10. After reading the book I was just a bit disappointed because they left a lot but added scenes to make up for it. I was extremely dissappointed when I found out there would be no scene where Pippin looks in the Palantir.The characters have the same qualities. The comic releif goes towards Gimli, Gollum, Pippin, and Treebeard while the action aspects go to Legolas, Aragorn, Gandalf, Eomer, and Ugluk. The new characters are awesome and portray there wholes exactly like the book. Grima Wormtounge I have to say was the best.The Scenes that left you at the edge of you seat the most include: Helms Deep, The Black Gates, The Wargs, The Olipaunt, The Ents taking over Isengard, and Gandalf healing Theoden.Overall the movie was good but just needed the extra touches that Tolien describes in his excellent novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible and Brilliant! There are no other adjectives to describe the magnificence of this film! Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's truth to the screen, and I can't wait for Return of the King. This trilogy will quickly become one of the classic films of cinema history!

Elijah Wood just sucked all the energy out of me, because my heart went out to this poor hobbit over and over and over! What a talented young actor!

I felt that the movie WAS sorely lacking in Merry and Pippin scenes and action, and yet it worked. However, I do expect more in the DVD! :) The stunning eye candy that this movie throws at you is just reason enough to see it a million times, and the story is another million. the cast and crew definitely deserve all praise they get, because they have accomplished a masterpiece. Although I found that the music wasn't as memorable as the first, it picked up on all the beautiful themes and underscored all the emotion perfectly. I sat at the end of the credits and just yearned for Return of the King to be placed before me. One more year??? Yeah...we can do it. Incredible...did I mention that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This second movie in the trilogy, can by no means match the first one. But as some people already stated, it would have been like comparing two different pieces of a jig-saw puzzle.

Perhaps it partly is because of the altered plot, as well as the exclusions of crucial parts. The Two Towers is my favorite book in the trilogy mainly because the wonderful description of the Ents and the Elves leaving the men behind to fight their war on their own. This totally disappears, but hopefully there is at least more scenes of the Ents in the upcoming extended version.Never the less, this IS a great movie. Just a more mainstream one than the last one.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS.In my opinion, FOTR was a brilliant film. I rated it a 10.0 here (the Extended DVD version).

To me, it came across as if PJ was editing the movie, realized that it was 2 hours and 59 minutes long, and said to himself "Oh my god, I've only got one minute left! I'll just throw in this quick pan of Shelob's mountain and be done with it!" In my opinion, he should have continued the plot right up until the brink of the confrontation with Shelob.Two other minor criticisms: the make-up job on the pre-exorcised Theodin was way over the top. Yes, he was possessed. But couldn't Jackson had made the point more subtly? It's like he didn't trust the audience's intelligence and had to hit them over the head by turning Theodin into a caricature.And the confrontation of Frodo with the black rider on the back of the flying creature (not nearly as frighteningly rendered as the black horses in FOTR): why was that necessary? It undermined one of the main sources of suspense in Tolkien's novels: that Frodo and Sam manage to stay just outside the view of Mordor.For these reasons, I rate TTT an 8.0. And I think that's being generous. In fairness, I am going to see this movie again (but probably only once again, in contrast to the fifteen times that I have scene FOTR), mostly to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if my opinion of it improves upon further viewing.Also in fairness, I had let my expectations build to the point that the movie could not do anything but disappoint. After all, these two movies together represent possibly the greatest epic ever to be filmed, and the third is hopefully going to be a return to the quality of the first. Though I must admit that I now have some doubts, something I would NOT have said after seeing FOTR.Also, on the plus side, the animation of Gollum was IMHO just AWESOME. Makes Yoda and Jar Jar Binks (hate to even mention him) and Dobby seem like hand puppets.Bottom line: I cannot hide a sense of disappointment. The tribute to Tolkien and Jackson is that I regard this LOTR trilogy - and PJ's films - as a personal possession, and I have lost a little pride in that possession upon the first viewing of TTT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part of this epic trilogy has been masterfully crafted on film. I found myself deeply moved by the emotional richness of The Two Towers, though it be in darker spirits than the first.Acting was high caliber (for the most part) bringing each character's strengths and frailties to life. Gollum takes my Best Actor award as well as compliments on FX.Battle scenes were aplenty, if a little too fast-paced at times for my taste. Cinematography and score left little to be desired; though I wondered where "Lux Aeterna" resounded!Do not attempt to compare the book and the film too closely. They are different media, each with their own inherent strengths and failings. I feel Jackson did an excellent job of stitching together the complexities of this story in the ever-so-short time alloted, balancing well struggles both epic and personal. Most importantly, he captured the essence of looming despair and the undying flicker of hope that made The Two Towers my favorite in the trilogy.Oh, and if you do not shed tears when you see "Arwen's Mortal Love" sequence (as I like to call it), then you have not felt the movie, nor do you possess the capacity to appreciate pure cinematic bliss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, James Bond and Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It used to be that the big action films and their sequels came out in the summer but that seems to be changing. Recently, the latest entries in four of the most famous film series of all time were released and I decided to see them all and perhaps compare them. The two older ones, James Bond and Star Trek, have shown their age in recent years, both of them often rehashing old plots and situations. The two newer ones, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, have caught the imagination of the public and have produced some of the most popular and admired movies of our time. To my surprise, I liked the old geezers better than the now more celebrated newcomers. I just found them more exciting and more entertaining. Isn't that what you pay a ticket for?I didn't care for the first Lord of the Rings, called "The Fellowship of the Ring". I was amazed by the special effects, which surpassed anything that I had seen before. The story, however seemed more like a protracted nightmare than an adventure. The heroes lacked any sense of esprit de corps. They looked more like the victims in a horror film, wondering if they were going to survive through the next scene. I just wanted it to end. Critics and friends said this one was better and I did like it more. There were more scenes that took place in the daylight. there was more humor, such as the Yogi Berraisms of the walking trees, ("You are small so you could be right"), and a fascinating character in Gollum, with his split personality paralleling the story of the ring, with the characters battling their darker natures. But it's still a three hour tour through a nightmare given by a cast of Lears. The battle scenes are spectacular, (the effects are even better than in the first film) and horrific. The army of Uruks with their Freddy Krueger faces and mounts that are described as wolves but snarl like grizzly bears are far more frightening than the Cylons of the Star Wars films but not much more effectual. Frodo Baggins has to be the least interesting epic hero of our times. I grew up with D'Artanian and Luke Skywalker. This is quite a comedown. Elijah Woods brings a worried look and little else to the role. Lord of the Rings has more meat on it's bones than other action films but it's not really entertaining in the truest sense.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was much more enjoyable than the first Lord of tthe Rings. It has plenty of action and was full of British whimsy and humor. The child-heroes had real charm. I looked forward to the new one, "The Chamber of Secrets". I liked it, too but not quite as much. The whimsy and wonder was more sublimated to fright-night horrors and an ending that seemed more like something out of Lord of the Rings. Perhaps they are trying to compete? They even have a dwarf character who is somewhat the equivalent of Gollum but not very similar or as interesting. I think Harry should use his wits and his magic to save the day, not a sword.The last James Bond film I saw was on a plane to Hawaii. It was called "Tomorrow Never Dies" and gave me no desire to see another one. It was all chase scenes and violent students while a glum-looking Pierce Brosnan never seemed to ruffle his Arrow shirt. There was no discernible plot or characterization. the whole thing simply seemed like an ad for a video game. "Die Another Day" proved to be a pleasant surprise. Bond is humanized by being captured and tortured for 14 months in a North Korean prison. He then is accused of spilling secrets by his own people, from whom he escapes and goes on a one man quest for revenge. As the movie goes on, this promising beginning evaporates and we go back to the video game absurdities, including Bond wind-surfing a seismic wave. But Halle Berry is worth a look and the film is never boring.Star Trek: Nemesis, while dismissed by critics, (as usual), proved to be the pick of the litter. It has as much action as the other series, (without overkill). It provides us with human characters we can really relate to and a story that is about something. In this case, it is about the very thing the film's critics complains it lacks: youth. The hero used to be a cocky, ambitious young officer wanting to make a name for himself. He's grown beyond that and now confronts a cloned version of himself with all the traits he used to possess, magnified by a childhood ordeal and now possessing great power. Captain Picard has to use what he knows about himself and what he has learned to win the day. He's helped by Data who effectively regresses to an earlier version of himself and will now have to retake the journey of experience and wisdom. There is more useful thought in this film than in the others combined and just as much excitement.But now I feel a great desire to see something about real people living real lives with real problems. It would be a welcome change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how I feel about this movie yet. The battle scenes were breathtaking, the special effects amazing, but I don't know. I am tired of movies that are really terrific including cheesy filler in the dialogue--which occurs frequently between Gimli and Legolas during very serious battle scenes. Moreover, the pitiful attempts at romance were strained at best. The battle scene, which was one of the best I have ever scene on film, was interrupted several times to delve further into the parallel stories. I felt that this detracted from the battle, which was the climax of the movie and should have developed uninterrupted. So--right now I'm not sure how I feel about it. I loved the first one, and I am trying very hard to endorse this one. Overall, it is definitely worth viewing at the theater, and I will definitely buy the DVD. Peter Jackson, if you are reading, no more cheesy lines!!! Please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not an LOTR fan, this was an incredible movie. I saw some of the digital effects on TV prior to going to the show and the movie held up to its end of the bargain: it was rich in stunning special effects, with realistic CG characters that offered life-like AI. Indeed, the massive combat scene towards the end was well worth the wait. While many of my fellow movie goers felt the need to wander out into the lobby, I was compelled to watch the entire thing. Spellbinding, I was glued to my seat for most of the entire 3 hour ordeal. The ending, which is really a beginning, left me feeling cheated and wanting more. Sadly, this movie will probably fade away in a few years due to its length, but I look forward to watching sequel in this (trilogy?). Elija Wood makes a great lead character into a device that compels the audience into the story even further than the original.This movie is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from New Zealand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is excellent, New Zealand landscape is amazing and the people in New Zealand are making such a masterpiece. The battle at Helm´s Deep is the most breathtaking scene that has been seen in a film. Gollrir is the best CG character that has been created. Andy Serkis surely does deserve an Oscar nomination. Lord of the rings is stolen from our mythology, called Snorra-Edda. Many characters bears Icelandic names, such as Gimli, Freya, and Grima Wormstongue. The both films have made New Zealand such a popular country in Iceland and we have been watching astonished how beautiful New Zealand is. Peter Jackson is adored in Iceland and is the most respected director. He has won the hearts of thousands of Icelanders. All the actors are doing a great job and are very convincing. The computer graphics is such a revolution and the mass scene at Helm´s Deep is so huge that the film really must watched again. New Zealanders simply deserve a huge bravo for their fascinating work.

		<fullReview>OK I just got back from seeing it and unlike the first one this one had a much more epic mood, throughout is nothing but extreme battles to save mankind. THe Beginning was amazing ..and the middle was incredible .. the ending was astonishing. The graphics were beyond what your imagination can take you to - certainly a kick in the balls to star wars. The textures the dynamics the realism ... will leave CG freaks like me drooling speechlessly.The main reason why this movie kicks ass is cause there are three battles going on at the same time at different parts of the country. I loved the pacing of the movie this time, Eisendor got their ass kicked just in just enough time for their last hope to come in. The realism of Gollum takes alot more then just motion capture, and for that I REALLLLY acredit the special effects team and Jason Schleifer since Gollum reminds me of this anorexic bitch I know from school. His role is of a bipolar schizofrenic( split personality) which in some parts is very humorus.For the ENTs, it's pretty obvoius why guardian Trees would fight for their 'kind' but when you get to see battle ......that @#%$ing just owns. There is a specific group of bad guys that took part in the book in the Hobbit (if you've read it) they are called the Goblin Scouts, I wont ruin that part for you, cause that part I was really anticipating how PJ was gonna pull that off.... and yes that blew me away too. Legolas is still a bad ass elf, and Gimli plays a great comical role, Aarogon is becomign more noticed by his people, and Sam still fat yet faithful to his friend that is slowly being consumed by the ring. Excellent plot modification of the sequence of events.:rollin certainly something no one should miss.For those of you that like to so called 'analyze' the comparison between a book and movie...well analyze this... MOVIES ARENT MADE TO BECOME EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE BOOK. NO ONE CARES WHICH PART THE DIRECTOR MISSED OUT. If its missed out and modified, its done for a perfectly GOOD REASON (ie film time, and broken down story telling for the feeble minded illiterates) If you read the trilogy, GOOD FOR YOU NO ONE CARES. Movies are INTERPRETATIONS. If you are going to judge a movie derived down from a book judge it on how well the director tried to meet percisness and credit its actors, its script, and special effects to enhance the signitured parts of the story interpreted.::COnsiderations you must take in hand before judging::::1) NOT ALL PEOPLE READ BOOKS like we do..WE may very well be the last of the literate beings- seeing how the majority youth of the new generation is falling due to television, which is the main part of the general public. This is One reason why the movie has to be well modified without the complex transitions minor events leading to the major events on after the other -- specifically modified so the general audience can have a piece of the fun too (as well as LOTR gurus) with out derailing off-track into the confusion of the true series of events but more or less a main general plot.For example, Why do you think the high vocabulary filled WALL STREET Journal isnt our daily newspaper? BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS 'Business and the fluctuation of the World's Economy' the main language of Stock marketers-brokers etc.. Face it! Thats just too many 'big' words for the general public, henceforth the reason why the METRO section was created for everyday public newspapers. They dilute such insane high intellectual knowledge into something more convenient and basic for everyone.2)BUDGET and FILMING TIME- If they were to accurately transfer the ENTIRE book (including the emotional detailed elongated parts to capture the audiences deep emotions and the transitoin parts to explaing the connection of certain events) into a movie, it would be as long as that gay ass DBZ series. Then people will complain that the movie was TOO LONG. ..But wait what if they fit the Entire book into the filming time Peter Jackson provides for each of his movies (3 hours per) for 3 movies ---then many emotional parts would be played too quickly enough for the audience to capture the real feeling for the developement of the characters.(ie Hobbit the cartoon- sucked major ass too @#%$n quick)(book obviously better)So the main point is.. dont expect too much.Be happy PJ so far has done a great job of interpretting this epic trilogy from an extraordinarily imaginative point of view. I dont think he's senile enough to pull a 'george lucas' move anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that the wait was well worthwhile. Having seen the first film turn out so well I knew that the second one was going to be of a similar standard, and I wasn't disappointed. The film just never stopped ratcheting up the tension. Bernard Hill played a great Theoden, it was a very memorable scene when he was crying over the grave of his son. The battle at Helms Deep was breath-taking. Just how I imagined it reading the book. Gollum was the best character I've seen in a film in years. The whole audience were laughing as he had that argument with himself. I still find it hard to believe that he was computer generated! New Zealand stole the show again! How can one small country have so many beautiful locations, and epic mountain ranges?If Peter Jackson ever reads this----- THANKS!Can't wait for next one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the criticism, is highly deserving of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid. Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time. Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care. The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.A number of viewers have commented on how "different" the movie is from the book. However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally. A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well. How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book. Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once? Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence. Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies. They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is for this trilogy what The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars. I don't know that The Return of the King will manage to be quite the film that this one is. The forboding and intensity is something that the finale by its very nature simply cannot be. I am a big fan of the middle chapter of any work because that is where the soul of the work lies. True drama lies in the characters and their struggles. Gollum is a wonder to behold. And despite the claims of many critics, The Ents are an awesome screen presence (They are my favorite characters in the novel). Their final attack on Saruman's Tower is one of the film's most incredible sights. The only real issue I have with the film is the meandering middle section. The Gondor/Rohan scenes are a bit of a drag. I personally enjoy films like this when they are showing me new and wonderful sights. The human story is a bit blah at times. Though it does culminate in the awesome battle of Helm's Deep, which is probably the best battle scene I've seen. Gimli the dwarf makes for perfect comic relief, especially as he tells Aragorn "Don't tell the elf you tossed me". The opening is wonderful as we hear the voice of Gandalf echoing through the stunning Middle Earth mountains and delightfully recognize where we are in the story. A fabulous movie that surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that the wait was well worthwhile. Having seen the first film turn out so well I knew that the second one was going to be of a similar standard, and I wasn't disappointed. The film just never stopped ratcheting up the tension. Bernard Hill played a great Theoden, it was a very memorable scene when he was crying over the grave of his son. The battle at Helms Deep was breath-taking. Just how I imagined it reading the book. Gollum was the best character I've seen in a film in years. The whole audience were laughing as he had that argument with himself. I still find it hard to believe that he was computer generated! New Zealand stole the show again! How can one small country have so many beautiful locations, and epic mountain ranges?If Peter Jackson ever reads this----- THANKS!Can't wait for next one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the criticism, is highly deserving of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid. Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time. Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care. The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.A number of viewers have commented on how "different" the movie is from the book. However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally. A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well. How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book. Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once? Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence. Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies. They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is for this trilogy what The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars. I don't know that The Return of the King will manage to be quite the film that this one is. The forboding and intensity is something that the finale by its very nature simply cannot be. I am a big fan of the middle chapter of any work because that is where the soul of the work lies. True drama lies in the characters and their struggles. Gollum is a wonder to behold. And despite the claims of many critics, The Ents are an awesome screen presence (They are my favorite characters in the novel). Their final attack on Saruman's Tower is one of the film's most incredible sights. The only real issue I have with the film is the meandering middle section. The Gondor/Rohan scenes are a bit of a drag. I personally enjoy films like this when they are showing me new and wonderful sights. The human story is a bit blah at times. Though it does culminate in the awesome battle of Helm's Deep, which is probably the best battle scene I've seen. Gimli the dwarf makes for perfect comic relief, especially as he tells Aragorn "Don't tell the elf you tossed me". The opening is wonderful as we hear the voice of Gandalf echoing through the stunning Middle Earth mountains and delightfully recognize where we are in the story. A fabulous movie that surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally moved by this movie! Right from the first few frames of the movie i was sucked in. I was totally transported to Middle Earth and felt as though I was a character in this epic adventure! The filmakers and actors should give themselves 100 pats on the back for this incredible performance! No other movie could compare to this - Wow!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite sure yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how I feel about this movie yet. The battle scenes were breathtaking, the special effects amazing, but I don't know. I am tired of movies that are really terrific including cheesy filler in the dialogue--which occurs frequently between Gimli and Legolas during very serious battle scenes. Moreover, the pitiful attempts at romance were strained at best. The battle scene, which was one of the best I have ever scene on film, was interrupted several times to delve further into the parallel stories. I felt that this detracted from the battle, which was the climax of the movie and should have developed uninterrupted. So--right now I'm not sure how I feel about it. I loved the first one, and I am trying very hard to endorse this one. Overall, it is definitely worth viewing at the theater, and I will definitely buy the DVD. Peter Jackson, if you are reading, no more cheesy lines!!! Please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not an LOTR fan, this was an incredible movie. I saw some of the digital effects on TV prior to going to the show and the movie held up to its end of the bargain: it was rich in stunning special effects, with realistic CG characters that offered life-like AI. Indeed, the massive combat scene towards the end was well worth the wait. While many of my fellow movie goers felt the need to wander out into the lobby, I was compelled to watch the entire thing. Spellbinding, I was glued to my seat for most of the entire 3 hour ordeal. The ending, which is really a beginning, left me feeling cheated and wanting more. Sadly, this movie will probably fade away in a few years due to its length, but I look forward to watching sequel in this (trilogy?). Elija Wood makes a great lead character into a device that compels the audience into the story even further than the original.This movie is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lord of the rings is without a doubt the greatest trilogy of all time which makes this one of the greatest films of all time. JRR Tolkien is an absolute genius he created these amazing characters himself like gollum and gandalf, aragorn and legolas they were all in Tolkiens head the man is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from New Zealand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is excellent, New Zealand landscape is amazing and the people in New Zealand are making such a masterpiece. The battle at Helm´s Deep is the most breathtaking scene that has been seen in a film. Gollrir is the best CG character that has been created. Andy Serkis surely does deserve an Oscar nomination. Lord of the rings is stolen from our mythology, called Snorra-Edda. Many characters bears Icelandic names, such as Gimli, Freya, and Grima Wormstongue. The both films have made New Zealand such a popular country in Iceland and we have been watching astonished how beautiful New Zealand is. Peter Jackson is adored in Iceland and is the most respected director. He has won the hearts of thousands of Icelanders. All the actors are doing a great job and are very convincing. The computer graphics is such a revolution and the mass scene at Helm´s Deep is so huge that the film really must watched again. New Zealanders simply deserve a huge bravo for their fascinating work. Thanks for this xmas gift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I just got back from seeing it and unlike the first one this one had a much more epic mood, throughout is nothing but extreme battles to save mankind. THe Beginning was amazing ..and the middle was incredible .. the ending was astonishing. The graphics were beyond what your imagination can take you to - certainly a kick in the balls to star wars. The textures the dynamics the realism ... will leave CG freaks like me drooling speechlessly.The main reason why this movie kicks ass is cause there are three battles going on at the same time at different parts of the country. I loved the pacing of the movie this time, Eisendor got their ass kicked just in just enough time for their last hope to come in. The realism of Gollum takes alot more then just motion capture, and for that I REALLLLY acredit the special effects team and Jason Schleifer since Gollum reminds me of this anorexic bitch I know from school. His role is of a bipolar schizofrenic( split personality) which in some parts is very humorus.For the ENTs, it's pretty obvoius why guardian Trees would fight for their 'kind' but when you get to see battle ......that @#%$ing just owns. There is a specific group of bad guys that took part in the book in the Hobbit (if you've read it) they are called the Goblin Scouts, I wont ruin that part for you, cause that part I was really anticipating how PJ was gonna pull that off.... and yes that blew me away too. Legolas is still a bad ass elf, and Gimli plays a great comical role, Aarogon is becomign more noticed by his people, and Sam still fat yet faithful to his friend that is slowly being consumed by the ring. Excellent plot modification of the sequence of events.:rollin certainly something no one should miss.For those of you that like to so called 'analyze' the comparison between a book and movie...well analyze this... MOVIES ARENT MADE TO BECOME EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE BOOK. NO ONE CARES WHICH PART THE DIRECTOR MISSED OUT. If its missed out and modified, its done for a perfectly GOOD REASON (ie film time, and broken down story telling for the feeble minded illiterates) If you read the trilogy, GOOD FOR YOU NO ONE CARES. Movies are INTERPRETATIONS. If you are going to judge a movie derived down from a book judge it on how well the director tried to meet percisness and credit its actors, its script, and special effects to enhance the signitured parts of the story interpreted.::COnsiderations you must take in hand before judging::::1) NOT ALL PEOPLE READ BOOKS like we do..WE may very well be the last of the literate beings- seeing how the majority youth of the new generation is falling due to television, which is the main part of the general public. This is One reason why the movie has to be well modified without the complex transitions minor events leading to the major events on after the other -- specifically modified so the general audience can have a piece of the fun too (as well as LOTR gurus) with out derailing off-track into the confusion of the true series of events but more or less a main general plot.For example, Why do you think the high vocabulary filled WALL STREET Journal isnt our daily newspaper? BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS 'Business and the fluctuation of the World's Economy' the main language of Stock marketers-brokers etc.. Face it! Thats just too many 'big' words for the general public, henceforth the reason why the METRO section was created for everyday public newspapers. They dilute such insane high intellectual knowledge into something more convenient and basic for everyone.2)BUDGET and FILMING TIME- If they were to accurately transfer the ENTIRE book (including the emotional detailed elongated parts to capture the audiences deep emotions and the transitoin parts to explaing the connection of certain events) into a movie, it would be as long as that gay ass DBZ series. Then people will complain that the movie was TOO LONG. ..But wait what if they fit the Entire book into the filming time Peter Jackson provides for each of his movies (3 hours per) for 3 movies ---then many emotional parts would be played too quickly enough for the audience to capture the real feeling for the developement of the characters.(ie Hobbit the cartoon- sucked major ass too @#%$n quick)(book obviously better)So the main point is.. dont expect too much.Be happy PJ so far has done a great job of interpretting this epic trilogy from an extraordinarily imaginative point of view. I dont think he's senile enough to pull a 'george lucas' move anytime soon.</fullReview>

The Gondor/Rohan scenes are a bit of a drag. I personally enjoy films like this when they are showing me new and wonderful sights. The human story is a bit blah at times. Though it does culminate in the awesome battle of Helm's Deep, which is probably the best battle scene I've seen. Gimli the dwarf makes for perfect comic relief, especially as he tells Aragorn "Don't tell the elf you tossed me". The opening is wonderful as we hear the voice of Gandalf echoing through the stunning Middle Earth mountains and delightfully recognize where we are in the story. A fabulous movie that surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

I was totally transported to Middle Earth and felt as though I was a character in this epic adventure! The filmakers and actors should give themselves 100 pats on the back for this incredible performance! No other movie could compare to this - Wow!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how I feel about this movie yet. The battle scenes were breathtaking, the special effects amazing, but I don't know. I am tired of movies that are really terrific including cheesy filler in the dialogue--which occurs frequently between Gimli and Legolas during very serious battle scenes. Moreover, the pitiful attempts at romance were strained at best. The battle scene, which was one of the best I have ever scene on film, was interrupted several times to delve further into the parallel stories. I felt that this detracted from the battle, which was the climax of the movie and should have developed uninterrupted. So--right now I'm not sure how I feel about it. I loved the first one, and I am trying very hard to endorse this one. Overall, it is definitely worth viewing at the theater, and I will definitely buy the DVD. Peter Jackson, if you are reading, no more cheesy lines!!! Please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not an LOTR fan, this was an incredible movie. I saw some of the digital effects on TV prior to going to the show and the movie held up to its end of the bargain: it was rich in stunning special effects, with realistic CG characters that offered life-like AI. Indeed, the massive combat scene towards the end was well worth the wait. While many of my fellow movie goers felt the need to wander out into the lobby, I was compelled to watch the entire thing. Spellbinding, I was glued to my seat for most of the entire 3 hour ordeal. The ending, which is really a beginning, left me feeling cheated and wanting more. Sadly, this movie will probably fade away in a few years due to its length, but I look forward to watching sequel in this (trilogy?). Elija Wood makes a great lead character into a device that compels the audience into the story even further than the original.This movie is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from New Zealand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is excellent, New Zealand landscape is amazing and the people in New Zealand are making such a masterpiece. The battle at Helm´s Deep is the most breathtaking scene that has been seen in a film. Gollrir is the best CG character that has been created. Andy Serkis surely does deserve an Oscar nomination. Lord of the rings is stolen from our mythology, called Snorra-Edda. Many characters bears Icelandic names, such as Gimli, Freya, and Grima Wormstongue. The both films have made New Zealand such a popular country in Iceland and we have been watching astonished how beautiful New Zealand is. Peter Jackson is adored in Iceland and is the most respected director. He has won the hearts of thousands of Icelanders. All the actors are doing a great job and are very convincing. The computer graphics is such a revolution and the mass scene at Helm´s Deep is so huge that the film really must watched again. New Zealanders simply deserve a huge bravo for their fascinating work. Thanks for this xmas gift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I just got back from seeing it and unlike the first one this one had a much more epic mood, throughout is nothing but extreme battles to save mankind. THe Beginning was amazing ..and the middle was incredible .. the ending was astonishing. The graphics were beyond what your imagination can take you to - certainly a kick in the balls to star wars. The textures the dynamics the realism ... will leave CG freaks like me drooling speechlessly.The main reason why this movie kicks ass is cause there are three battles going on at the same time at different parts of the country. I loved the pacing of the movie this time, Eisendor got their ass kicked just in just enough time for their last hope to come in. The realism of Gollum takes alot more then just motion capture, and for that I REALLLLY acredit the special effects team and Jason Schleifer since Gollum reminds me of this anorexic bitch I know from school. His role is of a bipolar schizofrenic( split personality) which in some parts is very humorus.For the ENTs, it's pretty obvoius why guardian Trees would fight for their 'kind' but when you get to see battle ......that @#%$ing just owns. There is a specific group of bad guys that took part in the book in the Hobbit (if you've read it) they are called the Goblin Scouts, I wont ruin that part for you, cause that part I was really anticipating how PJ was gonna pull that off.... and yes that blew me away too. Legolas is still a bad ass elf, and Gimli plays a great comical role, Aarogon is becomign more noticed by his people, and Sam still fat yet faithful to his friend that is slowly being consumed by the ring. Excellent plot modification of the sequence of events.:rollin certainly something no one should miss.For those of you that like to so called 'analyze' the comparison between a book and movie...well analyze this... MOVIES ARENT MADE TO BECOME EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE BOOK. NO ONE CARES WHICH PART THE DIRECTOR MISSED OUT. If its missed out and modified, its done for a perfectly GOOD REASON (ie film time, and broken down story telling for the feeble minded illiterates) If you read the trilogy, GOOD FOR YOU NO ONE CARES. Movies are INTERPRETATIONS. If you are going to judge a movie derived down from a book judge it on how well the director tried to meet percisness and credit its actors, its script, and special effects to enhance the signitured parts of the story interpreted.::COnsiderations you must take in hand before judging::::1) NOT ALL PEOPLE READ BOOKS like we do..WE may very well be the last of the literate beings- seeing how the majority youth of the new generation is falling due to television, which is the main part of the general public. This is One reason why the movie has to be well modified without the complex transitions minor events leading to the major events on after the other -- specifically modified so the general audience can have a piece of the fun too (as well as LOTR gurus) with out derailing off-track into the confusion of the true series of events but more or less a main general plot.For example, Why do you think the high vocabulary filled WALL STREET Journal isnt our daily newspaper? BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS 'Business and the fluctuation of the World's Economy' the main language of Stock marketers-brokers etc.. Face it! Thats just too many 'big' words for the general public, henceforth the reason why the METRO section was created for everyday public newspapers. They dilute such insane high intellectual knowledge into something more convenient and basic for everyone.2)BUDGET and FILMING TIME- If they were to accurately transfer the ENTIRE book (including the emotional detailed elongated parts to capture the audiences deep emotions and the transitoin parts to explaing the connection of certain events) into a movie, it would be as long as that gay ass DBZ series. Then people will complain that the movie was TOO LONG. ..But wait what if they fit the Entire book into the filming time Peter Jackson provides for each of his movies (3 hours per) for 3 movies ---then many emotional parts would be played too quickly enough for the audience to capture the real feeling for the developement of the characters.(ie Hobbit the cartoon- sucked major ass too @#%$n quick)(book obviously better)So the main point is.. dont expect too much.Be happy PJ so far has done a great job of interpretting this epic trilogy from an extraordinarily imaginative point of view. I dont think he's senile enough to pull a 'george lucas' move anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that the wait was well worthwhile. Having seen the first film turn out so well I knew that the second one was going to be of a similar standard, and I wasn't disappointed. The film just never stopped ratcheting up the tension. Bernard Hill played a great Theoden, it was a very memorable scene when he was crying over the grave of his son. The battle at Helms Deep was breath-taking. Just how I imagined it reading the book. Gollum was the best character I've seen in a film in years. The whole audience were laughing as he had that argument with himself. I still find it hard to believe that he was computer generated! New Zealand stole the show again! How can one small country have so many beautiful locations, and epic mountain ranges?If Peter Jackson ever reads this----- THANKS!Can't wait for next one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the criticism, is highly deserving of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid. Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time. Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care. The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.A number of viewers have commented on how "different" the movie is from the book. However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally. A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well. How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book. Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once? Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence. Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies. They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is for this trilogy what The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars. I don't know that The Return of the King will manage to be quite the film that this one is. The forboding and intensity is something that the finale by its very nature simply cannot be. I am a big fan of the middle chapter of any work because that is where the soul of the work lies. True drama lies in the characters and their struggles. Gollum is a wonder to behold. And despite the claims of many critics, The Ents are an awesome screen presence (They are my favorite characters in the novel). Their final attack on Saruman's Tower is one of the film's most incredible sights. The only real issue I have with the film is the meandering middle section.

		<fullReview>Although not an LOTR fan, this was an incredible movie. I saw some of the digital effects on TV prior to going to the show and the movie held up to its end of the bargain: it was rich in stunning special effects, with realistic CG characters that offered life-like AI. Indeed, the massive combat scene towards the end was well worth the wait. While many of my fellow movie goers felt the need to wander out into the lobby, I was compelled to watch the entire thing. Spellbinding, I was glued to my seat for most of the entire 3 hour ordeal. The ending, which is really a beginning, left me feeling cheated and wanting more. Sadly, this movie will probably fade away in a few years due to its length, but I look forward to watching sequel in this (trilogy?). Elija Wood makes a great lead character into a device that compels the audience into the story even further than the original.This movie is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I just got back from seeing it and unlike the first one this one had a much more epic mood, throughout is nothing but extreme battles to save mankind. THe Beginning was amazing ..and the middle was incredible .. the ending was astonishing. The graphics were beyond what your imagination can take you to - certainly a kick in the balls to star wars. The textures the dynamics the realism ... will leave CG freaks like me drooling speechlessly.The main reason why this movie kicks ass is cause there are three battles going on at the same time at different parts of the country. I loved the pacing of the movie this time, Eisendor got their ass kicked just in just enough time for their last hope to come in. The realism of Gollum takes alot more then just motion capture, and for that I REALLLLY acredit the special effects team and Jason Schleifer since Gollum reminds me of this anorexic bitch I know from school. His role is of a bipolar schizofrenic( split personality) which in some parts is very humorus.For the ENTs, it's pretty obvoius why guardian Trees would fight for their 'kind' but when you get to see battle ......that @#%$ing just owns. There is a specific group of bad guys that took part in the book in the Hobbit (if you've read it) they are called the Goblin Scouts, I wont ruin that part for you, cause that part I was really anticipating how PJ was gonna pull that off.... and yes that blew me away too. Legolas is still a bad ass elf, and Gimli plays a great comical role, Aarogon is becomign more noticed by his people, and Sam still fat yet faithful to his friend that is slowly being consumed by the ring. Excellent plot modification of the sequence of events.:rollin certainly something no one should miss.For those of you that like to so called 'analyze' the comparison between a book and movie...well analyze this... MOVIES ARENT MADE TO BECOME EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE BOOK. NO ONE CARES WHICH PART THE DIRECTOR MISSED OUT. If its missed out and modified, its done for a perfectly GOOD REASON (ie film time, and broken down story telling for the feeble minded illiterates) If you read the trilogy, GOOD FOR YOU NO ONE CARES. Movies are INTERPRETATIONS. If you are going to judge a movie derived down from a book judge it on how well the director tried to meet percisness and credit its actors, its script, and special effects to enhance the signitured parts of the story interpreted.::COnsiderations you must take in hand before judging::::1) NOT ALL PEOPLE READ BOOKS like we do..WE may very well be the last of the literate beings- seeing how the majority youth of the new generation is falling due to television, which is the main part of the general public. This is One reason why the movie has to be well modified without the complex transitions minor events leading to the major events on after the other -- specifically modified so the general audience can have a piece of the fun too (as well as LOTR gurus) with out derailing off-track into the confusion of the true series of events but more or less a main general plot.For example, Why do you think the high vocabulary filled WALL STREET Journal isnt our daily newspaper? BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS 'Business and the fluctuation of the World's Economy' the main language of Stock marketers-brokers etc.. Face it! Thats just too many 'big' words for the general public, henceforth the reason why the METRO section was created for everyday public newspapers. They dilute such insane high intellectual knowledge into something more convenient and basic for everyone.2)BUDGET and FILMING TIME- If they were to accurately transfer the ENTIRE book (including the emotional detailed elongated parts to capture the audiences deep emotions and the transitoin parts to explaing the connection of certain events) into a movie, it would be as long as that gay ass DBZ series. Then people will complain that the movie was TOO LONG. ..But wait what if they fit the Entire book into the filming time Peter Jackson provides for each of his movies (3 hours per) for 3 movies ---then many emotional parts would be played too quickly enough for the audience to capture the real feeling for the developement of the characters.(ie Hobbit the cartoon- sucked major ass too @#%$n quick)(book obviously better)So the main point is.. dont expect too much.Be happy PJ so far has done a great job of interpretting this epic trilogy from an extraordinarily imaginative point of view. I dont think he's senile enough to pull a 'george lucas' move anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that the wait was well worthwhile. Having seen the first film turn out so well I knew that the second one was going to be of a similar standard, and I wasn't disappointed. The film just never stopped ratcheting up the tension. Bernard Hill played a great Theoden, it was a very memorable scene when he was crying over the grave of his son. The battle at Helms Deep was breath-taking. Just how I imagined it reading the book. Gollum was the best character I've seen in a film in years. The whole audience were laughing as he had that argument with himself. I still find it hard to believe that he was computer generated! New Zealand stole the show again! How can one small country have so many beautiful locations, and epic mountain ranges?If Peter Jackson ever reads this----- THANKS!Can't wait for next one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the criticism, is highly deserving of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid. Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time. Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care. The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.A number of viewers have commented on how "different" the movie is from the book. However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally. A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well. How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book. Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once? Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence. Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies. They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is for this trilogy what The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars. I don't know that The Return of the King will manage to be quite the film that this one is. The forboding and intensity is something that the finale by its very nature simply cannot be. I am a big fan of the middle chapter of any work because that is where the soul of the work lies. True drama lies in the characters and their struggles. Gollum is a wonder to behold. And despite the claims of many critics, The Ents are an awesome screen presence (They are my favorite characters in the novel). Their final attack on Saruman's Tower is one of the film's most incredible sights. The only real issue I have with the film is the meandering middle section. The Gondor/Rohan scenes are a bit of a drag. I personally enjoy films like this when they are showing me new and wonderful sights. The human story is a bit blah at times. Though it does culminate in the awesome battle of Helm's Deep, which is probably the best battle scene I've seen. Gimli the dwarf makes for perfect comic relief, especially as he tells Aragorn "Don't tell the elf you tossed me". The opening is wonderful as we hear the voice of Gandalf echoing through the stunning Middle Earth mountains and delightfully recognize where we are in the story. A fabulous movie that surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how I feel about this movie yet. The battle scenes were breathtaking, the special effects amazing, but I don't know. I am tired of movies that are really terrific including cheesy filler in the dialogue--which occurs frequently between Gimli and Legolas during very serious battle scenes. Moreover, the pitiful attempts at romance were strained at best. The battle scene, which was one of the best I have ever scene on film, was interrupted several times to delve further into the parallel stories. I felt that this detracted from the battle, which was the climax of the movie and should have developed uninterrupted. So--right now I'm not sure how I feel about it. I loved the first one, and I am trying very hard to endorse this one. Overall, it is definitely worth viewing at the theater, and I will definitely buy the DVD. Peter Jackson, if you are reading, no more cheesy lines!!! Please!!!</fullReview>

Ok, I'm admittedly not a fantasy fan, and I'm probably the only person back in my high school in the 70's that didn't have any desire to read the novels, and still haven't to this day. With that said, the special effects were brilliant, and the cinematography superior. But for the life of me, I cannot understand the affection for the main Hobbit characters, they're boring, boring and more boring. The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show. I was also forced to see the first movie, and I thought that one would never end. Ditto for this one. Can hardly wait for the next one in a couple of years. Then again, I'm still waiting for a sequel to Killer Clowns from Outer Space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Gollum his deserved Oscar!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece. Although the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.Overall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely stunning....biblical. Can't wait another year :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much that can be said that hasn't already been chronicled in other viewers comments. I was incredibly surprised at how moving the film actually was. During the sequences leading up to the Battle at Helms Deep I was riveted to the screen. Not really being a fan of cgi I had been afraid that the portrayal of Gollum was going to be nothing more than a lame computer generated graphic. How wrong I was. It was Gollum who probably had more depth than any other character in the film. Watching his conflicted discussions really brought home the insidiousness of the Ring for me. I had read LOTR probably 25 times over the last 20 yrs and Follum was never as vivid as he was on screen.I have never before seen a battle filmed that can hold a candle to Helm's Deep, even the Ents storming Isengard was amazing. Its true that Peter Jackson took some serious liberties with the story line. And although I consider myself a Tolkien purist at heart the film was simply amazing. This interpretation complements Tolkiens work well and I think that JRR would be pleased with how it has come out so far. I cant wait until they release the extended version of TTT like FOTR, I could have used an extra 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic sequel lives up to "The Fellowship..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here we are, one year after THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. After all, if THE TWO TOWERS is anything like THE FELLOWSHIP. then it will undoubtedly be good. This is the obvious case. That's what happens when you have a director, Peter Jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. They are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. When THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING opened last year on December 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. What's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the Christmas holiday; rather it held on. With talk of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, THE FELLOWSHIP. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. Now, after one year of waiting we have THE TWO TOWERS. George Lucas, creator of the STAR WARS Trilogy and INDIANA JONES said it best during an interview about the original STAR WARS Trilogy. George said that every play has three acts. In the first act, there is a small victory. The second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. And in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. That's the case with THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy. THE FELLOWSHIP. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. THE TWO TOWERS pits its characters in the worst possible situation. Naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in THE RETURN OF THE KING. As for THE TWO TOWERS, Frodo and Sam are off in the land of Mordor, trying to get to the gates of Mordor to destroy `the one ring.' However, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but Gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of Bilbo. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him lead them to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gimly the dwarf, and Legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of THE FELLOWSHIP., Merry and Pippin. But the lands of Middle Earth are in more peril than ever, and Saruman The White is sending his army of Uruk-hai against the lands of Middle Earth. In this case, it is primarily the land of Rohan. It is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of Rohan, and with the help of Gandalf The White, formally The Grey. They lead the people of Rohan into an immense battle in a place called Helm's Deep.Obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. And I'm sure that those of you who haven't seen THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. If you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. But THE TWO TOWERS is equally as good as THE FELLOWSHIP. was. I can't really decide which film is better, or which I would prefer to watch. THE TWO TOWERS is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. The acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. But the acting isn't phony either. In fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. It's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. If you were not able to see THE FELLOWSHIP. theatrically, I urge you to see this one theatrically. Especially in a digital sound theater if you can. The film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on `the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. It's become more than a film. Rather, the release of THE TWO TOWERS is an event. I was fortunate enough to see it this morning in Albany at Hoyts Crossgates Cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. And believe me, I've been to many megaplexes from here to Florida. The show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. Like seeing the original STAR WARS on it's opening day reissue back on January 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. These films are amazing. See them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did it, at least, match your imagination? It surpassed mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all of my friends know that I read LOTR only when I found out that the book was voted as the greatest book of the century. Prior to that I've never even heard or give a sh*t abt Tolkien. I haven't read any single book in the top 10 list and was determined to at least read the book that tops the list even if it kills me. Yes, I was motivated to read LOTR out of vanity. It took me close to a year to finish it the first time around. It was laborious. Honestly, LOTR is a difficult book to read. It took me so long because I would stop every so often to re-read every sentence until it made sense in this little mind of mine.But the genius of the book didn't hit me until much later. I was reading the part when Frodo said "It's getting heavier" when I decided I couldn't stand it any longer and hurled the the book against the wall (which will explain why my copy of the book is in such bad shape and why it has been scotch-taped in so many places.) I didn't continue until weeks later. THAT was how powerful the book is. Frodo's burden became my burden. I didn't even realise that it was taking over my life until I came to that precise moment.For the longest time Middle Earth existed only in my head (of course today we all know that it is also known in modern times as New Zealand). I couldn't even talk about the book because no one else I know have read it and even when I tried I found that I could not convey the awe and respect that I feel towards the book and its writer. It's now 2002 and since then I've read the book maybe 20 additional times. 2 movies from the trilogy have been released. Today, everyone (unless you've been living with your head up your a** all these while) have at least heard of Frodo the blue-eyed hobbit and the delectable Arwen Evenstar.Well I have been of the opinion that it is impossible to bring the book to celluloid. IMPOSSIBLE. So when FOTR came out, I suspended all hopes and expectations. I told myself it doesn't matter -- even if FOTR tanked to high heavens I would already be so grateful for the effort to bringing it to life. Bring it on.And I was grateful. I still am. Honestly, there are very few things that I don't like abt both movies. And 'don't like' is such a strong phrase. I'd rephrase that to say that there are very few things that I thought could have been handled better. My initial reaction to the FOTR stands -- the fighting scenes were incredible but were not captured well enough -- and the same feeling came over me in TTT. The close-ups were disturbing and messy but didn't convey the urgency and desperation of war. But battle scenes have always been difficult to film anyway and very few directors have managed to do this gracefully (I can only name Kurosawa, no one else comes to mind at this point of time). The second one is this, I still think Aragon should be taller and statelier (he is from the race of kings, after all) and more tormented -- for someone who's forced to reclaim his throne and lead the last great war of the Third Age -- somehow I didn't think his pain and solitude came across very well in the movies. But, what do I know? It's probably a tactical strategy on Peter Jackson's part so that the focus of the film remains on the hobbits.But apart from that, there are many things to love. In TTT, Gollum is a wonder. The scene of him singing at the Forbidden Pool is priceless and when he was brutally captured by Faramir's soldiers - although you know it's just CGI - you can't help but feel sorry for it. The CGI is excellent. I gladly revoke my loyalty to Squaresoft and pass the torch to WETA. In the book I hated Gollum and couldn't understand why Frodo didn't kill it; just as I felt no sadness for Boromir when he died. Watching the films made me see the other sides of these 2 unfortunate characters -- I only saw the evil when I read the book but the films brought out their humanity.My favourite scenes are actually the ones that PJ added into the movie ie the scenes at Helm's Deep between (i) Legolas vs Gimli when Gimli complains that he can't see any of the battle.. the only scene where Legolas smiles voluntarily and (ii) Aragorn vs Gimli when they are about to ambush the orcs using the side door.What can I say? If you haven't watched TTT -- go! Not because it is a great fantasy fiction flick but because it is simply Lord Of The Rings -- the book from which, in my humble opinion, all fantasy fiction books/movies were born from. If reading is not your thing (and the book is more than 1,000 pages long the appendices alone can kill you) the movies are worthy substitutes. They are not 100% JRR Tolkien... no one can achieve that I think, but the heart and spirit of the movies are very close the what was conveyed in the book.And of course, the Legolas in the movies is so much cuter than the Legolas I had in my mind :-)TTT is an excellent piece of work and a worthy successor to FOTR. Miss this at your own peril!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is probably the greatest movie i have ever seen. Wonderful performances by all of the characters but especially Andy Serkis, who performed Seamgol/ Gollum. Excellant battle sequence, compared to the measly 15 min ,give or take, in Fellowship. 10/10 hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much that can be said that hasn't already been chronicled in other viewers comments. I was incredibly surprised at how moving the film actually was. During the sequences leading up to the Battle at Helms Deep I was riveted to the screen. Not really being a fan of cgi I had been afraid that the portrayal of Gollum was going to be nothing more than a lame computer generated graphic. How wrong I was. It was Gollum who probably had more depth than any other character in the film. Watching his conflicted discussions really brought home the insidiousness of the Ring for me. I had read LOTR probably 25 times over the last 20 yrs and Follum was never as vivid as he was on screen.I have never before seen a battle filmed that can hold a candle to Helm's Deep, even the Ents storming Isengard was amazing. Its true that Peter Jackson took some serious liberties with the story line. And although I consider myself a Tolkien purist at heart the film was simply amazing. This interpretation complements Tolkiens work well and I think that JRR would be pleased with how it has come out so far. I cant wait until they release the extended version of TTT like FOTR, I could have used an extra 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic sequel lives up to "The Fellowship..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here we are, one year after THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. After all, if THE TWO TOWERS is anything like THE FELLOWSHIP. then it will undoubtedly be good. This is the obvious case. That's what happens when you have a director, Peter Jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. They are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. When THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING opened last year on December 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. What's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the Christmas holiday; rather it held on. With talk of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, THE FELLOWSHIP. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. Now, after one year of waiting we have THE TWO TOWERS. George Lucas, creator of the STAR WARS Trilogy and INDIANA JONES said it best during an interview about the original STAR WARS Trilogy. George said that every play has three acts. In the first act, there is a small victory. The second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. And in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. That's the case with THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy. THE FELLOWSHIP. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. THE TWO TOWERS pits its characters in the worst possible situation. Naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in THE RETURN OF THE KING. As for THE TWO TOWERS, Frodo and Sam are off in the land of Mordor, trying to get to the gates of Mordor to destroy `the one ring.' However, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but Gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of Bilbo. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him lead them to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gimly the dwarf, and Legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of THE FELLOWSHIP., Merry and Pippin. But the lands of Middle Earth are in more peril than ever, and Saruman The White is sending his army of Uruk-hai against the lands of Middle Earth. In this case, it is primarily the land of Rohan. It is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of Rohan, and with the help of Gandalf The White, formally The Grey. They lead the people of Rohan into an immense battle in a place called Helm's Deep.Obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. And I'm sure that those of you who haven't seen THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. If you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. But THE TWO TOWERS is equally as good as THE FELLOWSHIP. was. I can't really decide which film is better, or which I would prefer to watch. THE TWO TOWERS is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. The acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. But the acting isn't phony either. In fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. It's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. If you were not able to see THE FELLOWSHIP. theatrically, I urge you to see this one theatrically. Especially in a digital sound theater if you can. The film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on `the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. It's become more than a film. Rather, the release of THE TWO TOWERS is an event. I was fortunate enough to see it this morning in Albany at Hoyts Crossgates Cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. And believe me, I've been to many megaplexes from here to Florida. The show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. Like seeing the original STAR WARS on it's opening day reissue back on January 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. These films are amazing. See them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did it, at least, match your imagination? It surpassed mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all of my friends know that I read LOTR only when I found out that the book was voted as the greatest book of the century. Prior to that I've never even heard or give a sh*t abt Tolkien. I haven't read any single book in the top 10 list and was determined to at least read the book that tops the list even if it kills me. Yes, I was motivated to read LOTR out of vanity. It took me close to a year to finish it the first time around. It was laborious. Honestly, LOTR is a difficult book to read. It took me so long because I would stop every so often to re-read every sentence until it made sense in this little mind of mine.But the genius of the book didn't hit me until much later. I was reading the part when Frodo said "It's getting heavier" when I decided I couldn't stand it any longer and hurled the the book against the wall (which will explain why my copy of the book is in such bad shape and why it has been scotch-taped in so many places.) I didn't continue until weeks later. THAT was how powerful the book is. Frodo's burden became my burden. I didn't even realise that it was taking over my life until I came to that precise moment.For the longest time Middle Earth existed only in my head (of course today we all know that it is also known in modern times as New Zealand). I couldn't even talk about the book because no one else I know have read it and even when I tried I found that I could not convey the awe and respect that I feel towards the book and its writer. It's now 2002 and since then I've read the book maybe 20 additional times. 2 movies from the trilogy have been released. Today, everyone (unless you've been living with your head up your a** all these while) have at least heard of Frodo the blue-eyed hobbit and the delectable Arwen Evenstar.Well I have been of the opinion that it is impossible to bring the book to celluloid. IMPOSSIBLE. So when FOTR came out, I suspended all hopes and expectations. I told myself it doesn't matter -- even if FOTR tanked to high heavens I would already be so grateful for the effort to bringing it to life. Bring it on.And I was grateful. I still am. Honestly, there are very few things that I don't like abt both movies. And 'don't like' is such a strong phrase. I'd rephrase that to say that there are very few things that I thought could have been handled better. My initial reaction to the FOTR stands -- the fighting scenes were incredible but were not captured well enough -- and the same feeling came over me in TTT. The close-ups were disturbing and messy but didn't convey the urgency and desperation of war. But battle scenes have always been difficult to film anyway and very few directors have managed to do this gracefully (I can only name Kurosawa, no one else comes to mind at this point of time). The second one is this, I still think Aragon should be taller and statelier (he is from the race of kings, after all) and more tormented -- for someone who's forced to reclaim his throne and lead the last great war of the Third Age -- somehow I didn't think his pain and solitude came across very well in the movies. But, what do I know? It's probably a tactical strategy on Peter Jackson's part so that the focus of the film remains on the hobbits.But apart from that, there are many things to love. In TTT, Gollum is a wonder. The scene of him singing at the Forbidden Pool is priceless and when he was brutally captured by Faramir's soldiers - although you know it's just CGI - you can't help but feel sorry for it. The CGI is excellent. I gladly revoke my loyalty to Squaresoft and pass the torch to WETA. In the book I hated Gollum and couldn't understand why Frodo didn't kill it; just as I felt no sadness for Boromir when he died. Watching the films made me see the other sides of these 2 unfortunate characters -- I only saw the evil when I read the book but the films brought out their humanity.My favourite scenes are actually the ones that PJ added into the movie ie the scenes at Helm's Deep between (i) Legolas vs Gimli when Gimli complains that he can't see any of the battle.. the only scene where Legolas smiles voluntarily and (ii) Aragorn vs Gimli when they are about to ambush the orcs using the side door.What can I say? If you haven't watched TTT -- go! Not because it is a great fantasy fiction flick but because it is simply Lord Of The Rings -- the book from which, in my humble opinion, all fantasy fiction books/movies were born from. If reading is not your thing (and the book is more than 1,000 pages long the appendices alone can kill you) the movies are worthy substitutes. They are not 100% JRR Tolkien... no one can achieve that I think, but the heart and spirit of the movies are very close the what was conveyed in the book.And of course, the Legolas in the movies is so much cuter than the Legolas I had in my mind :-)TTT is an excellent piece of work and a worthy successor to FOTR. Miss this at your own peril!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is probably the greatest movie i have ever seen. Wonderful performances by all of the characters but especially Andy Serkis, who performed Seamgol/ Gollum. Excellant battle sequence, compared to the measly 15 min ,give or take, in Fellowship. 10/10 hands down.</fullReview>

I love Legolas and Sam and saw this movie the other day. 3 hours didn't even feel like 3 hours. at the end everyone in the theater clapped- i love it when that happens...I highly recommend this one, it's rather intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely stunning....biblical. Can't wait another year :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much that can be said that hasn't already been chronicled in other viewers comments. I was incredibly surprised at how moving the film actually was. During the sequences leading up to the Battle at Helms Deep I was riveted to the screen. Not really being a fan of cgi I had been afraid that the portrayal of Gollum was going to be nothing more than a lame computer generated graphic. How wrong I was. It was Gollum who probably had more depth than any other character in the film. Watching his conflicted discussions really brought home the insidiousness of the Ring for me. I had read LOTR probably 25 times over the last 20 yrs and Follum was never as vivid as he was on screen.I have never before seen a battle filmed that can hold a candle to Helm's Deep, even the Ents storming Isengard was amazing. Its true that Peter Jackson took some serious liberties with the story line. And although I consider myself a Tolkien purist at heart the film was simply amazing. This interpretation complements Tolkiens work well and I think that JRR would be pleased with how it has come out so far. I cant wait until they release the extended version of TTT like FOTR, I could have used an extra 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic sequel lives up to "The Fellowship..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here we are, one year after THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. After all, if THE TWO TOWERS is anything like THE FELLOWSHIP. then it will undoubtedly be good. This is the obvious case. That's what happens when you have a director, Peter Jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. They are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. When THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING opened last year on December 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. What's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the Christmas holiday; rather it held on. With talk of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, THE FELLOWSHIP. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. Now, after one year of waiting we have THE TWO TOWERS. George Lucas, creator of the STAR WARS Trilogy and INDIANA JONES said it best during an interview about the original STAR WARS Trilogy. George said that every play has three acts. In the first act, there is a small victory. The second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. And in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. That's the case with THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy. THE FELLOWSHIP. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. THE TWO TOWERS pits its characters in the worst possible situation. Naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in THE RETURN OF THE KING. As for THE TWO TOWERS, Frodo and Sam are off in the land of Mordor, trying to get to the gates of Mordor to destroy `the one ring.' However, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but Gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of Bilbo. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him lead them to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gimly the dwarf, and Legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of THE FELLOWSHIP., Merry and Pippin. But the lands of Middle Earth are in more peril than ever, and Saruman The White is sending his army of Uruk-hai against the lands of Middle Earth. In this case, it is primarily the land of Rohan. It is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of Rohan, and with the help of Gandalf The White, formally The Grey. They lead the people of Rohan into an immense battle in a place called Helm's Deep.Obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. And I'm sure that those of you who haven't seen THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. If you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. But THE TWO TOWERS is equally as good as THE FELLOWSHIP. was. I can't really decide which film is better, or which I would prefer to watch. THE TWO TOWERS is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. The acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. But the acting isn't phony either. In fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. It's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. If you were not able to see THE FELLOWSHIP. theatrically, I urge you to see this one theatrically. Especially in a digital sound theater if you can. The film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on `the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. It's become more than a film. Rather, the release of THE TWO TOWERS is an event. I was fortunate enough to see it this morning in Albany at Hoyts Crossgates Cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. And believe me, I've been to many megaplexes from here to Florida. The show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. Like seeing the original STAR WARS on it's opening day reissue back on January 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. These films are amazing. See them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did it, at least, match your imagination? It surpassed mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all of my friends know that I read LOTR only when I found out that the book was voted as the greatest book of the century. Prior to that I've never even heard or give a sh*t abt Tolkien. I haven't read any single book in the top 10 list and was determined to at least read the book that tops the list even if it kills me. Yes, I was motivated to read LOTR out of vanity. It took me close to a year to finish it the first time around. It was laborious. Honestly, LOTR is a difficult book to read. It took me so long because I would stop every so often to re-read every sentence until it made sense in this little mind of mine.But the genius of the book didn't hit me until much later. I was reading the part when Frodo said "It's getting heavier" when I decided I couldn't stand it any longer and hurled the the book against the wall (which will explain why my copy of the book is in such bad shape and why it has been scotch-taped in so many places.) I didn't continue until weeks later. THAT was how powerful the book is. Frodo's burden became my burden. I didn't even realise that it was taking over my life until I came to that precise moment.For the longest time Middle Earth existed only in my head (of course today we all know that it is also known in modern times as New Zealand). I couldn't even talk about the book because no one else I know have read it and even when I tried I found that I could not convey the awe and respect that I feel towards the book and its writer. It's now 2002 and since then I've read the book maybe 20 additional times. 2 movies from the trilogy have been released. Today, everyone (unless you've been living with your head up your a** all these while) have at least heard of Frodo the blue-eyed hobbit and the delectable Arwen Evenstar.Well I have been of the opinion that it is impossible to bring the book to celluloid. IMPOSSIBLE. So when FOTR came out, I suspended all hopes and expectations. I told myself it doesn't matter -- even if FOTR tanked to high heavens I would already be so grateful for the effort to bringing it to life. Bring it on.And I was grateful. I still am. Honestly, there are very few things that I don't like abt both movies. And 'don't like' is such a strong phrase. I'd rephrase that to say that there are very few things that I thought could have been handled better. My initial reaction to the FOTR stands -- the fighting scenes were incredible but were not captured well enough -- and the same feeling came over me in TTT. The close-ups were disturbing and messy but didn't convey the urgency and desperation of war. But battle scenes have always been difficult to film anyway and very few directors have managed to do this gracefully (I can only name Kurosawa, no one else comes to mind at this point of time). The second one is this, I still think Aragon should be taller and statelier (he is from the race of kings, after all) and more tormented -- for someone who's forced to reclaim his throne and lead the last great war of the Third Age -- somehow I didn't think his pain and solitude came across very well in the movies. But, what do I know? It's probably a tactical strategy on Peter Jackson's part so that the focus of the film remains on the hobbits.But apart from that, there are many things to love. In TTT, Gollum is a wonder. The scene of him singing at the Forbidden Pool is priceless and when he was brutally captured by Faramir's soldiers - although you know it's just CGI - you can't help but feel sorry for it. The CGI is excellent. I gladly revoke my loyalty to Squaresoft and pass the torch to WETA. In the book I hated Gollum and couldn't understand why Frodo didn't kill it; just as I felt no sadness for Boromir when he died. Watching the films made me see the other sides of these 2 unfortunate characters -- I only saw the evil when I read the book but the films brought out their humanity.My favourite scenes are actually the ones that PJ added into the movie ie the scenes at Helm's Deep between (i) Legolas vs Gimli when Gimli complains that he can't see any of the battle.. the only scene where Legolas smiles voluntarily and (ii) Aragorn vs Gimli when they are about to ambush the orcs using the side door.What can I say? If you haven't watched TTT -- go! Not because it is a great fantasy fiction flick but because it is simply Lord Of The Rings -- the book from which, in my humble opinion, all fantasy fiction books/movies were born from. If reading is not your thing (and the book is more than 1,000 pages long the appendices alone can kill you) the movies are worthy substitutes. They are not 100% JRR Tolkien... no one can achieve that I think, but the heart and spirit of the movies are very close the what was conveyed in the book.And of course, the Legolas in the movies is so much cuter than the Legolas I had in my mind :-)TTT is an excellent piece of work and a worthy successor to FOTR. Miss this at your own peril!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on opening day and waited 2 hours to see it and i work at the theater i saw it at, the number of people alone ensured me that this movie would blow my mind the same way as the first.This movie has no beginning and no end so it feels incomplete at first which was a problem i had coming out of the film because the last thing i remember about the movie was nothing. But the bad ending aside(we all knew it was coming anyways) this movie was spectacular. The battle scenes were like nothing ever seen before and just a tastse of what we will be seeing in the third film. The only drawbacks to the film were the few peices of comic relief because it seemed so horribly out of place, mainly because in the first film the comedy was just feel good stuff that made you comfortable with the charachters and made you truely care for them so that when they are put in danger you worry more. But in two towers they just make wise comments which seem to mock the movie, i think the comedy should have been left out because it was hard to feel the emotions of certain scenes because of a generic one liner, in parcitular the beginning of the battle of helms deep gimli is waiting next to legolas in the fort for the uru kai charge and while i started getting that powerful feeling of dread for the danger the characters were in it was quickly shot by the camera goin to gimmlis head not going over the wall and he cracked a rediculous joke about not being able to see and the audience cracked up and i laughed but the scene was dead and the uru kai charged and a truly powerful scene was lost for me. I want to view this movie again in a smaller crowd and truely expirence it for myself which i advise everyone to do because when theres a crowd laughing hysterically during a battle scene it because very hard to get into it.But enough gripes dont get me wrong because this was more than an amazing movie because it made me realize that if a film can be this good and there are three of them and they are each different and the next one will be better then i am proud to be witness to what in my opinion is the greatest event in cinematic history. Movies like the these are the movies that will truely inspire you, because it inspired me. Sorry for the long review.. here this is for those of you who wont read the whole thingGO SEE THIS MOVIE IT IS AMAZING AND FAN OR NOT ULL EITHER STAY ONE OR BECOME ONE YOU CANT LOSE.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better than the book! Jackson triumphs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm a huge fan of the novels (I won't dispute that it's among the best literary works), Tolken DOES possess flaws...flaws that I think Peter Jackson is correcting with the movie trilogy. "The Two Towers" was always my least favorite book, mainly because it all feels like setup to what happens in "Return of the King" and was a little too quiet after "Fellowship." However, Jackson's film not only tops last year's "Fellowship" movie, he also improves on the book!People fail to realize that if you filmed the books page by page, the movies would be a total mess. The stories are divided up in a way that doesn't pay attention to structure...something three feature-length films hinge on. What if "Fellowship" had just ended when they got out of their boats? Not only do the new scenes add more meat to the characters and story, it also tops the scope of the first movie and gives each running storyline a fullfilling climax. These films are the perfect adaptations of the novels. Jackson has taken the most difficult and complex translation in film history and made it into a masterpiece of story and beauty that we will probably never see the likes of again. Also, all the harsh criticisms I see here seem to be made by people who don't have the slightest clue about filmmaking. People like "Grrr from England" are just literary snobs who don't deserve to have an opinion, because their complaints are silly and ungrounded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were tremendous moments in this film. There were scenes that made your hair stand on end and take your breath away. But then there were sections where I started staring at the walls and ceiling. It seemed to me that the areas where Jackson strayed the most from the book were the sections that were the least entertaining and the most jerky. Also, some of Jackson's changes where very non-original going to over used "hero over the cliff, thought lost, but wait." Of course things must be rearranged to fit a movie, but many were just done poorly giving a very jerky and inconsistent feel to the movie.Despite all its flaws, this is still a better movie than most. The highs still overcome its lows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's own yardstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't sweat the fidelity of such a splendid action flick to it's source. No one is really keeping score of that, are they? I mean, anyone who is has been burned by Hollywood nearly every time a book or play has been "adapted", at least from the time of the Mid-1930s Midsummer Night's Dream, which included the writer credit "From the Shakespeare Play, with additional dialog by Sam Taylor." I choose instead to judge it on it's internal logic, for the most part, it's wholeness as an experience, and how much it satisfies. --Do I have to ignore an inordinate number of stupid things along the way in order to keep my mind right with the film? Judged thusly, it is a hell of a ride. It often comes much closer to old fashioned Romantic film-making than anything that has come to the screen since the death of David Lean. (Very high praise for an epic.) Any complaint I have here would be small-view carping. One of many memorable scenes: The enemy --a kind of manimal-- is ferocious as any ever put on film, and to see them 10,000+ strong and marching massed for battle is genuinely hackles-raising. I am not a Tolkienite; I find most literature about made up mythologies silly in the extreme. And still, I was swept away by this film. I would recommend it to everybody who has no delusions that Hollywood gives a hang about maintaining the integrity of the works they adapt to blockbuster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted this movie strayed from the book, but Tolkien had some boring spots in all 3 books. I could have done without the dogs of war, but, what a great play on words. This movie moved me and amused me and was the subject of discussion for 3 hours after. It did what all great movies do, entertain. You felt like you were there, in the great hall, in the fortress, great sets, writing and acting. The stunts and extras did an amazing job of carrying on. Some of the special effects were a little lame, but I can let that ride. What would have been nice is a break in the middle. I'm too old to go that long with out a trip to the bathroom. I look forward to the dvd so I can watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you read the book, read all of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, it deviates with the book, but it's not as bad as some people apparently think. My only problem is that the people who made this film seem to want to emphasize that men are weak and stupid, and I think Faramir and Theoden suffer unfairly in their characterizations for it. That aside, I found this adaptation just swell. Really, that's all I have to say about the film itself.I wasn't going to review this film, but I read something saying two things that show less knowledge of the book than the writer apparently believes to be in possession of.1. Return of the King is the longest book of the series. It has 544 pages if you count all of them. The appendices and index at the back of that volume, though, amount to about 144 pages, and the story portion of The Return of the King comes in at more like 400 pages. It's actually a lot shorter then The Fellowship of the Ring, which clocks in at 527 pages. I also don't mind leaving the business of Shelob, and Gandalf's confrontation of Saruman at Orthanc to the beginning of the next film. After thinking about it a little, perhaps keeping them in The Two Towers would have been somewhat anti-climactic. Leaving those bits until the next film, however, will not expand its length over much. It may even balance out the timing a little. We'll see.2. The business about the love of Arwen and Aragorn is nowhere in the book. Check out appendix A from the abovementioned sections. It's all there. It's just that Tolkien places it happening before all the business of this story gets started. I suppose it could have been handled in flashback, but that might have been intrusive. That's a judgment call, and Jackson's choice didn't bother me.In fact, there are numerous references to the appendices, as well as occasional nods at The Silmarillion, throughout both films, and I expect the third will have many more. Don't assume the filmmakers made them up unless you've read those sections. There are deviations from the book, but they are no worse in this film than the first. If they bothered you overmuch in the first film, then you probably want to avoid the second. If you think the second has a lot more departures, then you probably stopped reading when you hit the appendices, and you should read them before condemning their use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********Spoiler Warning****************I just saw the Two Towers, and much like the Fellowship it'll probably be a while before I decide how I really feel about it. It was darker than the Fellowship, and didn't quite have same sense of panorama, the sweeping grandeur and spectacle. It fits a role akin to the Empire Strikes Back, filling in the middle part of the story, advancing the plot, but not resolving it. It does have a lot more things going on, and from what I can tell some Tolkein fans are going ape that Peter Jackson edited and changed some things around. I haven't read the books, and therefore don't know all the ins and outs of the story; it didn't look too bad to me, and I think the streamlining may have helped as I was already getting confused who was who halfway through.Three parts of the movie were very weak to me and didn't work at all. First was the attacking wolf hounds or hyenas or whatever they were, which didn't look very real and didn't add much to the plot save to toss Aragorn off a cliff. Secondly was the Uruk-Hai, who had seemed like such animal monsters in the first film now were talking and acting like a bunch of cannibalistic British soccer fans--where did the accents come from all of a sudden? The other was the walking trees. Definitely an item of legend and myth, but not something that translates too well on the screen, in other words they looked pretty silly. On the other hand I really hope that Rohan princess appears again in the next movie--I thought she was even better looking than Liv Tyler.The battle scenes were spectacular, but I think they still fell far short of the intensity of Kurosawa's Ran or Saving Private Ryan. Since we all know there's a third movie coming the primary characters aren't going to die, but there's not the visceral feeling of life or death, only impressively huge armies running into each other and very quick fighting shots. However, the ending to this one does make a better sort of finality than the Fellowship, as events get ready for the third installment. Did it fall short of my expectations? Slightly, but then those expectations were pretty high. Am I looking forward to "Return of the King?" Absolutely.</fullReview>

It was OK, but I found the Two Towers to be a much better stand alone movie. It was three hours of pure movie entertainment. Great action, great background (both computer generated and real life), great acting, and gullum was just unreal. Even the part with the live trees was OK, I never thought they would be able to pull that off. All in all it was just great fun. This is not a movie for real young children.

		<fullReview>Absolutely outstanding!When people ask me about this movie, one thing that crops up in 9 out of 10 conversations is the question `Is the movie true to the book?' To me this is an unfair question. If you had asked Peter Jackson to make a movie that was beyond all doubt ?true' to the book, you would have a sequence of 9 hour movies instead of 3 hour movies. Also, the movies would be disjointed, dull and unwatchable. Why, you ask? Because movies require a unique combination of flow and pace that books are not constrained to, and transferring a story to film without adapting it for the job would be a big mistake. Book and film are not compatible media. What I often say is that the movie is true to the SPIRIT of the book. I get the same feeling watching the film that I got when I'd sit up late at night, reading under lamp-light because I could not tear myself away from the story. The characters on screen look to me as though secret agents from Weta Workshops mind reading department have tiptoed in to my bedroom at night and plucked the images from my mind ? and I'm not the only person who says that ? all the hardcore Tolkien fans I have shared this thought with have agreed with great enthusiasm. After watching this film, I feel justified in my past comments that PJ is a genius. I have been a fan since he produced the cult classic BAD TASTE in 1987, an alien/zombie movie that relied on vision and talent as opposed to a big budget? or any real kind of budget at all, to be honest. The movie was improvised from start to finish (that's right, made up as they went along), and only received any kind of funding (beyond that which came from PJ's own pocket) just before its completion.Jackson is a creative genius, and deserves every word of praise he gets. No other person could translate the greatest fiction ever written in to the greatest film ever made the way he has. I give the Lord Of The Rings a score of 15 out of 10.(This review has been submitted verbatim for both The Fellowship Of The Ring &amp; The Two Towers)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am... speechless. I still can't decide if I like the Two Towers more then the Fellowship of the Ring. This is definately one of the greateset movies I have ever seen. I would give it 10 10's out of 10. I would nominate the Two Towers for every Oscar category. This is THE BEST special effects movie to date. I'm gonna go see it again right now. Everyone on earth should see this movie at least twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're going to base a movie on a book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that there is no argument that Jackson has a lot of technical skill. The movie was extremely well done, was acted well, and had great special effects, Gollum especially. It's also plain that in order to fit these movies into three hours, a lot of editing had to be done, not only to make it fit, but also to modify the story for the silver screen. Having said that, I have to say that I was not happy with the changes that Jackson made.What's the point of claiming to be based on a book if you're not going to be faithful to the spirit of the original? If you go to see something being touted as a James Bond film and the main character is a five-year old girl, you have a right to be upset. Not that Jackson went to this extreme, but my point is that there is certainly grounds to complain about the changes. One of the things that I love about Tolkein's books is the depth of the detail. I feel like I KNOW Tolkein's world. I was upset, then, when I realized that what was on the screen was no longer Tolkein's world, but Jackson's. If you haven't yet seen this film, I would say go ahead and see it anyway, but if you're a purist, be prepared to get p***ed off. I managed to keep myself from booing until the end. Barely.*********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***********There are parts of Tolkein's mythos that Jackson completely ignored. For instance, one of the themes of Lord of the Rings was that the age of the elves was coming to an end. There's a reason why they do almost nothing as a race throughout the book. Why then, do they show up in the movie at Helm's Deep? Perhaps so that Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel can have more of a reason for showing up in the film at all! I wonder if a certain amount of screen time was written into their contracts.Also, the magic in Tolkein's world, both wizardly and elven, was a subtle kind, except perhaps for Gandalf's fireworks. Jackson got a bit ham-handed with his magic. Saruman's possession of Theoden not only didn't make sense (between raising an army and talking to Sauron, where did Saruman get the time to keep Theoden senile and old-looking?), it was nothing like any other magic in the book. At one point, Frodo throws an elven cloak over himself and Sam, making them look like a big rock, down to the rough surface and rocky shape. In the book, Pippin actually makes a point of asking if the cloaks are magic and is told that the cloaks just tend to change hues with the environment. Nothing is said about magical shape changing.I could go on, but let me just finish by saying that I would still recommend this film, if only to make the bridge between The Fellowship of the Ring and the (hopefully better) Return of the King, but if seeing a movie that's faithful to the book is particularly important to you, get your booing muscles ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson, have mercy. . .(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that I had been sitting in the theater, watching "The Two Towers", for a very long time --much longer than the usual time a modern person's body clock allows for watching a single movie. So when a certain blackout occurred on the screen --despite the fact that I knew that there was more story still to go in the book of "The Two Towers", that Frodo and Sam had still to meet "Her", that Gandalf had still to confront Saruman and both Pippin and Aragorn to look in the Palantir of Orthanc-- despite all the story left to be told, I eyed this particular blackout on the screen with trepidation, and drew back in my chair, holding my breath. And then, came the words I knew must come and yet hoped might be delayed just a little longer. They were the first words of the ending credits, telling me that the film I had just seen, which was now over, had been directed by Peter Jackson. I let out my breath. Yes, I thought. It is over.And then I thought: I AM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE I SEE THE REST OF THIS FILM.Peter Jackson, couldn't you make a nice Summer 2003 release of The Return of the King? Huh? Please?I won't even bother to rave and gush about how great this film was. Everyone else is already doing it for me, and it kind of goes without saying. However, I wouldn't be the true LOTR geek that I am if I didn't quibble just a little bit about a few minor things. In no order of importance: (1) the Jackson-fabricated bit where Aragorn falls over the cliff and is telepathically "resurrected" by Arwen was completely unnecessary. Also, between that bit and what has already happened to Gandalf, there is a danger of oversaturating and therefore desensitizing the audience. How many more characters can we expect to fall a great distance and be given up for dead, only to make a spectacular, emotional comeback? Speaking of which, (2) the return of Gandalf, and particularly the revelation of Gandalf to the others in the Fellowship, is treated with very broad swift strokes in this film. (3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli). (4) Eowyn is far too sunny and "girlish". All that "poison" that Wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. She's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) While I understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having Faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath, intending to bring the Ring as a weapon to Gondor, I wish Peter Jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast Faramir in such a bad light. In the book, Faramir "shows his quality" by rejecting the Ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. Why must he be so much weaker in the film? And finally, (6) Huorns!! Where are the Huorns? Don't tell me, Peter Jackson, that you can make CGI mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and Gollum and Ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking Orc-swallowing demon forest??But seriously, a summer release for Return of the King. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best 9 i could ever give</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to rate this movie because it doesn't seem like a separate movie. Although I'm a huge fan of lord of the rings i gave this one a 9. The only real drawback was that it skipped around way too much. Every time I started to get into one scene it would switch to something else. Of course the scenery, special effects, the attention to detail, costumes, weapons, armor, the CGI , and the list goes on was the best of the best the only drawback, like i said, was that it just skipped around as soon as i got into it. It made the fight scenes less memorable unlike the first one. Still a VERY VERY f***in BADA** movie that you HAVE TO see. The movie still feels like a legend being brought to life. Its definetly an experience. I need to see it mmm... 6 more times within the next 10 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming the ending of an Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darkness. Bleakness. Age. The final mustering of strength of a weary warrior and of weary, ruined kingdoms long past their splendor. The end of an Age of the world. That is what the Two Towers invokes. Watching this film reminded me in a way that Fellowship did not that I am witnessing before my eyes the end of the Third Age. That is what this film is about. The darkness is not just the darkness of Mordor consuming Middle Earth, it is the darkness and bleakness of the end of an Age. Yes, elves are leaving Middle Earth. But, men and the kingdom of men also seem at their end, long past their glory. These ancient, worn kingdoms of men seem called upon to master their last strength, strength that is long past its glory; their kingdoms seem shadows, ruins, remnants of their former glory. Even when Theoden is no longer "possessed", Rohan and Theoden still seem past their glory, weary warriors, Rohan seems a weary kingdom, devoid of life, at the end of its days, gray and worn, devoid of many people. There are no teeming multitudes in Rohan. It seems an empty cold, windy chilled plain, a barren land. Osgilath, the ruined city of Gondor is in decay. Even the sky throughout the film is gray and bleak, like a gray, depressing November or December day at the end of a year, the dying season, winter. Sams words at the end of the film (pulled directly from the book) echoes this theme, what will there be left to save at the end? Will anything that once was remain the same? All will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as PJ has already hinted at for the Return of the King and as readers of the books already know. This is a movie about war. In this, it is much different than Fellowship of the Ring. Fellowship of the Ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. Two Towers, as PJ said, is a movie about men, about warfare. The movie, for me, at least, centers around Rohan and Theoden and Aragon (and Faramir) and the war of men (Rohan and Gondor) against Saruman and Mordor. This movie is much less Frodo-centric than Fellowship of the Ring. I remember in the DVD of Fellowship that Phillipa said that Fellowship was rewritten to make all the story Frodo-centric, centered around Frodo and the ring. While Frodo is still important in the Two Towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on Rohan and the plight of men (the plight of Osgilath and Farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. Gondor and Rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. When the banner of Rohan falls before Aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of Middle Earth at the time of the film. To me, the main characters in this film are Theoden and Aragon, the old king of Rohan and the future king of Gondor. In Theoden we see the passing of the Third Age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in Germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. He is torn about leading his people to war. He knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. He might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. I found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic. Viggo again does a wonderful job as Aragon. As for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. John Rhyss-Davies is hilarious as Gimli. I love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of Fellowship and not returned to Fellowship until the extended DVD. As for Gollum, I did not find him as believable as many people have stated. Throughout he seemed to me CGI. However, in close ups of his face, he did look like Andy Serkis. Truly this was an actor acting Gollum when we focused on Gollum's face. I felt pity for Smeagol and terror of Gollum. PJ does a great job at the turmoil of Smeagol/Gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how Gollum is what Frodo is already becoming because of his "addiction" to the ring. I did not find the changes to Faramir's character jarring. I had always found the Faramir section of the Two Towers rather boring, so I liked that there was more tension involved. In the end, Faramir is the Faramir that we know from the books. He doesn't give in to the ring. &gt; The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with Arwen. I did however think the scene where we see Arwen and Elrond together and Arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film. As for the Ents, Treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. Some of the other Ents however looked a little "cutesy". I did have some misgivings that the Ents did not after Entmoot say right away that they would attack Saruman, but having Pippin and Merry lead Treebeard toward Orthanc to show him the desolation Saruman had created does give Pippin and Merry a more important role to play. We do get to see Pippin and Merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of Theoden/Aragon and the other of Frodo/Golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer). Gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. Again, I think because the script was written toward focusing on the Aragon and Theoden comparison and the Frodo and Gollum comparison. On the whole this is a very different film from Fellowship. Fellowship was about Frodo. This is about the ending of an Age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times. Did I like it? Yes. But for different reasons than Fellowship because this is a very different film than Fellowship as PJ has said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Stopping Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To try and describe this incredible work of genius with words would be a fruitless and futile effort. There are times throughout history when some things shine so brilliant, when some things stand so far above the rest that you can only stand back and admire in awe of thier perfection and greatness. This is one of those times. LOTR The two towers is a jaw-dropping thrill ride...that will push the limits of imagination and bring you into a world where the line between the screen and real life is eliminated. You will become the story. This must by any standards be the most visually stunning and impressive movie ever created. The effects and visual mastery have reached the point of perfection, and the boundless detail and special effect vividness have passed the point of imagination. At three hours, the film is packed with enough storyline and visual effects for 100 movies. The three hours, however, will blink by in the wink of an eye. The script and storyline are flawless, the movie has simply everything that is great and good in cinema, mind-numbing special effects, chracters to be remembered forever, and gripping power. If you can only see a few films in a lifetime...see this masterpiece. For those of you who do not like it, I would recommend you to not watch movies.for nothing will please you. This movie cannot really be described, it is something you just have to see for yourself. Unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not the book on the screen. It is Peter Jacksons version. That said, this piece of art is simply breathtaking - awesome!"Two Towers" tells the middle part of "The Lord of the Rings" with great imagery and love for details. The story focuses on the lands of Rohan and struggle of its people to survive, while switching every now and then to accompany Frodo.Just one more thing - GOLLUM - cg character with acting, with emotions, you wont believe how good this is until you have seen him yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen this year. Now I am not even a fan of Tolkien's book -- never read the tale. But I was just captivated by this. It is epic movie making at its best. The battle scene at the end was just UNBELIEVABLE.I first saw Akira Kurasawa's "Seven Samurai" in college, and the relentless battles staged in "Two Towers" reminded me of those in the Japanese firm. In the "Two Towers" they are just as skillfully directed and edited, but they are SO MUCH GRANDER from the technology and money of today's Hollywood. This movie testifies to the dominance of Hollywood in the world entertainment. It is a sheer joy to be transported to the fantasy world on Middle Earth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. One of the best I've seen. That being said this is not The Two Towers book. This is pretty much a movie based on a book. Too much was changed or left out if you are a fan of the books. Unfortunately, most people who will see this movie will not have read the books. I guess that is good for the movie producers. Do yourself a favor and read the Trilogy and The Hobbit. They are amazing. Then look at this as a good movie based on some awesome books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some rationalization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw Two Towers on opening day I was definitely disappointed. Plot and characterization changes were getting to me. But after being so completely impressed with Fellowship, I didn't understand how since TT was made at the same time, by the same people, how it could be so different. So I tried to rationalize the seemingly abundant liberties taken by the film makers. Everything made sense once I put myself in their shoes. On the second viewing I enjoyed this movie on the same level as I did Fellowship. Here are some of my justification for the more major changes made:*Faramir is such a steadfast and comforting character in the book(possibly my favorite character). He's a man we all could serve under, respect, and love. But he is static without much development at all. He would add no tension or conflict to frodo and sams journey. If the ring is tempting to all men, including Aragorn, he would add an inconsisteny as well. Although I dont like this change, I can see why they would decide to do what they did. In the end he does turn true to character although I hope in ROTK he really shows his virtues to the fore.*When the Nazgul sees frodo at osgiliath-that took awhile for me to justify. It takes away sam and frodos biggest advantage in their trek-that Sauron doesnt know where the ring is. But he does assume it will be taken to gondor and men will attempt to use it against him. Well it has been seen in Osgiliath (in GONDOR) by people who are retreating to minas tirith. It still appears to be heading in that direction.*Warg riders are mentioned by Tolkien, just not in TT. So its not like they are using something of their own invention. This also gives them a way to bring in the relationship with arwen through flashbacks. And the material used for that is overwhelmingly Tolkien's from the Appendix. I like it a lot.*Cutting the movie after helms deep and after frodo's and sam's release-well if you look at Book 6 there are only three chapters till the climax of the story-this gives them more to work with in ROTK. Shelob WILL be there. Book 5 is mostly fighting as well, this will give them more variety of material to use. (And ROTK is the shortest book once you take out the couple hundred pages of appendix)*Rohirrim-many of the details were switched around, but this was probably good in that it eliminated some minor characters and places (Dunharrow) which could add so much confusion to mostly all firstcomers. In the end nothing of overall plot importance was changed. Hopefully Eomer will get to do a little more and Theoden will continue to grow as a leader of men in ROTK.*It was hard to care about the new MEN introduced in TT in comparison to Boromir. We got to watch him and feel for him through his journey. Cant say that for faramir, eomer, and theoden (not as much though) yet. I want to care for them more. But there is room for this in ROTK. They could be excellently contrasted to Denethor (the only major character yet to get screen time).A couple other comments: Gollum-WOW! they showed so many various and honest emotions through a CGI character. WOW! Performances-I thought were even stronger in this installment-there were a few ackward moments in FOTR, but can't remember any in TT</fullReview>

Of course the scenery, special effects, the attention to detail, costumes, weapons, armor, the CGI , and the list goes on was the best of the best the only drawback, like i said, was that it just skipped around as soon as i got into it. It made the fight scenes less memorable unlike the first one. Still a VERY VERY f***in BADA** movie that you HAVE TO see. The movie still feels like a legend being brought to life. Its definetly an experience. I need to see it mmm... 6 more times within the next 10 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming the ending of an Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darkness. Bleakness. Age. The final mustering of strength of a weary warrior and of weary, ruined kingdoms long past their splendor. The end of an Age of the world. That is what the Two Towers invokes. Watching this film reminded me in a way that Fellowship did not that I am witnessing before my eyes the end of the Third Age. That is what this film is about. The darkness is not just the darkness of Mordor consuming Middle Earth, it is the darkness and bleakness of the end of an Age. Yes, elves are leaving Middle Earth. But, men and the kingdom of men also seem at their end, long past their glory. These ancient, worn kingdoms of men seem called upon to master their last strength, strength that is long past its glory; their kingdoms seem shadows, ruins, remnants of their former glory. Even when Theoden is no longer "possessed", Rohan and Theoden still seem past their glory, weary warriors, Rohan seems a weary kingdom, devoid of life, at the end of its days, gray and worn, devoid of many people. There are no teeming multitudes in Rohan. It seems an empty cold, windy chilled plain, a barren land. Osgilath, the ruined city of Gondor is in decay. Even the sky throughout the film is gray and bleak, like a gray, depressing November or December day at the end of a year, the dying season, winter. Sams words at the end of the film (pulled directly from the book) echoes this theme, what will there be left to save at the end? Will anything that once was remain the same? All will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as PJ has already hinted at for the Return of the King and as readers of the books already know. This is a movie about war. In this, it is much different than Fellowship of the Ring. Fellowship of the Ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. Two Towers, as PJ said, is a movie about men, about warfare. The movie, for me, at least, centers around Rohan and Theoden and Aragon (and Faramir) and the war of men (Rohan and Gondor) against Saruman and Mordor. This movie is much less Frodo-centric than Fellowship of the Ring. I remember in the DVD of Fellowship that Phillipa said that Fellowship was rewritten to make all the story Frodo-centric, centered around Frodo and the ring. While Frodo is still important in the Two Towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on Rohan and the plight of men (the plight of Osgilath and Farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. Gondor and Rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. When the banner of Rohan falls before Aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of Middle Earth at the time of the film. To me, the main characters in this film are Theoden and Aragon, the old king of Rohan and the future king of Gondor. In Theoden we see the passing of the Third Age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in Germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. He is torn about leading his people to war. He knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. He might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. I found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic. Viggo again does a wonderful job as Aragon. As for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. John Rhyss-Davies is hilarious as Gimli. I love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of Fellowship and not returned to Fellowship until the extended DVD. As for Gollum, I did not find him as believable as many people have stated. Throughout he seemed to me CGI. However, in close ups of his face, he did look like Andy Serkis. Truly this was an actor acting Gollum when we focused on Gollum's face. I felt pity for Smeagol and terror of Gollum. PJ does a great job at the turmoil of Smeagol/Gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how Gollum is what Frodo is already becoming because of his "addiction" to the ring. I did not find the changes to Faramir's character jarring. I had always found the Faramir section of the Two Towers rather boring, so I liked that there was more tension involved. In the end, Faramir is the Faramir that we know from the books. He doesn't give in to the ring. &gt; The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with Arwen. I did however think the scene where we see Arwen and Elrond together and Arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film. As for the Ents, Treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. Some of the other Ents however looked a little "cutesy". I did have some misgivings that the Ents did not after Entmoot say right away that they would attack Saruman, but having Pippin and Merry lead Treebeard toward Orthanc to show him the desolation Saruman had created does give Pippin and Merry a more important role to play. We do get to see Pippin and Merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of Theoden/Aragon and the other of Frodo/Golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer). Gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. Again, I think because the script was written toward focusing on the Aragon and Theoden comparison and the Frodo and Gollum comparison. On the whole this is a very different film from Fellowship. Fellowship was about Frodo. This is about the ending of an Age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times. Did I like it? Yes. But for different reasons than Fellowship because this is a very different film than Fellowship as PJ has said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To try and describe this incredible work of genius with words would be a fruitless and futile effort. There are times throughout history when some things shine so brilliant, when some things stand so far above the rest that you can only stand back and admire in awe of thier perfection and greatness. This is one of those times. LOTR The two towers is a jaw-dropping thrill ride...that will push the limits of imagination and bring you into a world where the line between the screen and real life is eliminated. You will become the story. This must by any standards be the most visually stunning and impressive movie ever created. The effects and visual mastery have reached the point of perfection, and the boundless detail and special effect vividness have passed the point of imagination. At three hours, the film is packed with enough storyline and visual effects for 100 movies. The three hours, however, will blink by in the wink of an eye. The script and storyline are flawless, the movie has simply everything that is great and good in cinema, mind-numbing special effects, chracters to be remembered forever, and gripping power. If you can only see a few films in a lifetime...see this masterpiece. For those of you who do not like it, I would recommend you to not watch movies.for nothing will please you. This movie cannot really be described, it is something you just have to see for yourself. Unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. One of the best I've seen. That being said this is not The Two Towers book. This is pretty much a movie based on a book. Too much was changed or left out if you are a fan of the books. Unfortunately, most people who will see this movie will not have read the books. I guess that is good for the movie producers. Do yourself a favor and read the Trilogy and The Hobbit. They are amazing. Then look at this as a good movie based on some awesome books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some rationalization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw Two Towers on opening day I was definitely disappointed. Plot and characterization changes were getting to me. But after being so completely impressed with Fellowship, I didn't understand how since TT was made at the same time, by the same people, how it could be so different. So I tried to rationalize the seemingly abundant liberties taken by the film makers. Everything made sense once I put myself in their shoes. On the second viewing I enjoyed this movie on the same level as I did Fellowship. Here are some of my justification for the more major changes made:*Faramir is such a steadfast and comforting character in the book(possibly my favorite character). He's a man we all could serve under, respect, and love. But he is static without much development at all. He would add no tension or conflict to frodo and sams journey. If the ring is tempting to all men, including Aragorn, he would add an inconsisteny as well. Although I dont like this change, I can see why they would decide to do what they did. In the end he does turn true to character although I hope in ROTK he really shows his virtues to the fore.*When the Nazgul sees frodo at osgiliath-that took awhile for me to justify. It takes away sam and frodos biggest advantage in their trek-that Sauron doesnt know where the ring is. But he does assume it will be taken to gondor and men will attempt to use it against him. Well it has been seen in Osgiliath (in GONDOR) by people who are retreating to minas tirith. It still appears to be heading in that direction.*Warg riders are mentioned by Tolkien, just not in TT. So its not like they are using something of their own invention. This also gives them a way to bring in the relationship with arwen through flashbacks. And the material used for that is overwhelmingly Tolkien's from the Appendix. I like it a lot.*Cutting the movie after helms deep and after frodo's and sam's release-well if you look at Book 6 there are only three chapters till the climax of the story-this gives them more to work with in ROTK. Shelob WILL be there. Book 5 is mostly fighting as well, this will give them more variety of material to use. (And ROTK is the shortest book once you take out the couple hundred pages of appendix)*Rohirrim-many of the details were switched around, but this was probably good in that it eliminated some minor characters and places (Dunharrow) which could add so much confusion to mostly all firstcomers. In the end nothing of overall plot importance was changed. Hopefully Eomer will get to do a little more and Theoden will continue to grow as a leader of men in ROTK.*It was hard to care about the new MEN introduced in TT in comparison to Boromir. We got to watch him and feel for him through his journey. Cant say that for faramir, eomer, and theoden (not as much though) yet. I want to care for them more. But there is room for this in ROTK. They could be excellently contrasted to Denethor (the only major character yet to get screen time).A couple other comments: Gollum-WOW! they showed so many various and honest emotions through a CGI character. WOW! Performances-I thought were even stronger in this installment-there were a few ackward moments in FOTR, but can't remember any in TT</fullReview>

I would give it 10 10's out of 10. I would nominate the Two Towers for every Oscar category. This is THE BEST special effects movie to date. I'm gonna go see it again right now.

		<shortDescription>If you're going to base a movie on a book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that there is no argument that Jackson has a lot of technical skill. The movie was extremely well done, was acted well, and had great special effects, Gollum especially. It's also plain that in order to fit these movies into three hours, a lot of editing had to be done, not only to make it fit, but also to modify the story for the silver screen. Having said that, I have to say that I was not happy with the changes that Jackson made.What's the point of claiming to be based on a book if you're not going to be faithful to the spirit of the original? If you go to see something being touted as a James Bond film and the main character is a five-year old girl, you have a right to be upset. Not that Jackson went to this extreme, but my point is that there is certainly grounds to complain about the changes. One of the things that I love about Tolkein's books is the depth of the detail. I feel like I KNOW Tolkein's world. I was upset, then, when I realized that what was on the screen was no longer Tolkein's world, but Jackson's. If you haven't yet seen this film, I would say go ahead and see it anyway, but if you're a purist, be prepared to get p***ed off. I managed to keep myself from booing until the end. Barely.*********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***********There are parts of Tolkein's mythos that Jackson completely ignored. For instance, one of the themes of Lord of the Rings was that the age of the elves was coming to an end. There's a reason why they do almost nothing as a race throughout the book. Why then, do they show up in the movie at Helm's Deep? Perhaps so that Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel can have more of a reason for showing up in the film at all! I wonder if a certain amount of screen time was written into their contracts.Also, the magic in Tolkein's world, both wizardly and elven, was a subtle kind, except perhaps for Gandalf's fireworks. Jackson got a bit ham-handed with his magic. Saruman's possession of Theoden not only didn't make sense (between raising an army and talking to Sauron, where did Saruman get the time to keep Theoden senile and old-looking?), it was nothing like any other magic in the book. At one point, Frodo throws an elven cloak over himself and Sam, making them look like a big rock, down to the rough surface and rocky shape. In the book, Pippin actually makes a point of asking if the cloaks are magic and is told that the cloaks just tend to change hues with the environment. Nothing is said about magical shape changing.I could go on, but let me just finish by saying that I would still recommend this film, if only to make the bridge between The Fellowship of the Ring and the (hopefully better) Return of the King, but if seeing a movie that's faithful to the book is particularly important to you, get your booing muscles ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson, have mercy. . .(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that I had been sitting in the theater, watching "The Two Towers", for a very long time --much longer than the usual time a modern person's body clock allows for watching a single movie. So when a certain blackout occurred on the screen --despite the fact that I knew that there was more story still to go in the book of "The Two Towers", that Frodo and Sam had still to meet "Her", that Gandalf had still to confront Saruman and both Pippin and Aragorn to look in the Palantir of Orthanc-- despite all the story left to be told, I eyed this particular blackout on the screen with trepidation, and drew back in my chair, holding my breath. And then, came the words I knew must come and yet hoped might be delayed just a little longer. They were the first words of the ending credits, telling me that the film I had just seen, which was now over, had been directed by Peter Jackson. I let out my breath. Yes, I thought. It is over.And then I thought: I AM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE I SEE THE REST OF THIS FILM.Peter Jackson, couldn't you make a nice Summer 2003 release of The Return of the King? Huh? Please?I won't even bother to rave and gush about how great this film was. Everyone else is already doing it for me, and it kind of goes without saying. However, I wouldn't be the true LOTR geek that I am if I didn't quibble just a little bit about a few minor things. In no order of importance: (1) the Jackson-fabricated bit where Aragorn falls over the cliff and is telepathically "resurrected" by Arwen was completely unnecessary. Also, between that bit and what has already happened to Gandalf, there is a danger of oversaturating and therefore desensitizing the audience. How many more characters can we expect to fall a great distance and be given up for dead, only to make a spectacular, emotional comeback? Speaking of which, (2) the return of Gandalf, and particularly the revelation of Gandalf to the others in the Fellowship, is treated with very broad swift strokes in this film. (3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli). (4) Eowyn is far too sunny and "girlish". All that "poison" that Wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. She's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) While I understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having Faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath, intending to bring the Ring as a weapon to Gondor, I wish Peter Jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast Faramir in such a bad light. In the book, Faramir "shows his quality" by rejecting the Ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. Why must he be so much weaker in the film? And finally, (6) Huorns!! Where are the Huorns? Don't tell me, Peter Jackson, that you can make CGI mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and Gollum and Ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking Orc-swallowing demon forest??But seriously, a summer release for Return of the King. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. One of the best I've seen. That being said this is not The Two Towers book. This is pretty much a movie based on a book. Too much was changed or left out if you are a fan of the books. Unfortunately, most people who will see this movie will not have read the books. I guess that is good for the movie producers. Do yourself a favor and read the Trilogy and The Hobbit. They are amazing. Then look at this as a good movie based on some awesome books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some rationalization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw Two Towers on opening day I was definitely disappointed. Plot and characterization changes were getting to me. But after being so completely impressed with Fellowship, I didn't understand how since TT was made at the same time, by the same people, how it could be so different. So I tried to rationalize the seemingly abundant liberties taken by the film makers. Everything made sense once I put myself in their shoes. On the second viewing I enjoyed this movie on the same level as I did Fellowship. Here are some of my justification for the more major changes made:*Faramir is such a steadfast and comforting character in the book(possibly my favorite character). He's a man we all could serve under, respect, and love. But he is static without much development at all. He would add no tension or conflict to frodo and sams journey. If the ring is tempting to all men, including Aragorn, he would add an inconsisteny as well. Although I dont like this change, I can see why they would decide to do what they did. In the end he does turn true to character although I hope in ROTK he really shows his virtues to the fore.*When the Nazgul sees frodo at osgiliath-that took awhile for me to justify. It takes away sam and frodos biggest advantage in their trek-that Sauron doesnt know where the ring is. But he does assume it will be taken to gondor and men will attempt to use it against him. Well it has been seen in Osgiliath (in GONDOR) by people who are retreating to minas tirith. It still appears to be heading in that direction.*Warg riders are mentioned by Tolkien, just not in TT. So its not like they are using something of their own invention. This also gives them a way to bring in the relationship with arwen through flashbacks. And the material used for that is overwhelmingly Tolkien's from the Appendix. I like it a lot.*Cutting the movie after helms deep and after frodo's and sam's release-well if you look at Book 6 there are only three chapters till the climax of the story-this gives them more to work with in ROTK. Shelob WILL be there. Book 5 is mostly fighting as well, this will give them more variety of material to use. (And ROTK is the shortest book once you take out the couple hundred pages of appendix)*Rohirrim-many of the details were switched around, but this was probably good in that it eliminated some minor characters and places (Dunharrow) which could add so much confusion to mostly all firstcomers. In the end nothing of overall plot importance was changed. Hopefully Eomer will get to do a little more and Theoden will continue to grow as a leader of men in ROTK.*It was hard to care about the new MEN introduced in TT in comparison to Boromir. We got to watch him and feel for him through his journey. Cant say that for faramir, eomer, and theoden (not as much though) yet. I want to care for them more. But there is room for this in ROTK. They could be excellently contrasted to Denethor (the only major character yet to get screen time).A couple other comments: Gollum-WOW! they showed so many various and honest emotions through a CGI character. WOW! Performances-I thought were even stronger in this installment-there were a few ackward moments in FOTR, but can't remember any in TT</fullReview>

I would give it 10 10's out of 10. I would nominate the Two Towers for every Oscar category. This is THE BEST special effects movie to date. I'm gonna go see it again right now.

		<shortDescription>If you're going to base a movie on a book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that there is no argument that Jackson has a lot of technical skill. The movie was extremely well done, was acted well, and had great special effects, Gollum especially. It's also plain that in order to fit these movies into three hours, a lot of editing had to be done, not only to make it fit, but also to modify the story for the silver screen. Having said that, I have to say that I was not happy with the changes that Jackson made.What's the point of claiming to be based on a book if you're not going to be faithful to the spirit of the original? If you go to see something being touted as a James Bond film and the main character is a five-year old girl, you have a right to be upset. Not that Jackson went to this extreme, but my point is that there is certainly grounds to complain about the changes. One of the things that I love about Tolkein's books is the depth of the detail. I feel like I KNOW Tolkein's world. I was upset, then, when I realized that what was on the screen was no longer Tolkein's world, but Jackson's. If you haven't yet seen this film, I would say go ahead and see it anyway, but if you're a purist, be prepared to get p***ed off. I managed to keep myself from booing until the end. Barely.*********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***********There are parts of Tolkein's mythos that Jackson completely ignored. For instance, one of the themes of Lord of the Rings was that the age of the elves was coming to an end. There's a reason why they do almost nothing as a race throughout the book. Why then, do they show up in the movie at Helm's Deep? Perhaps so that Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel can have more of a reason for showing up in the film at all! I wonder if a certain amount of screen time was written into their contracts.Also, the magic in Tolkein's world, both wizardly and elven, was a subtle kind, except perhaps for Gandalf's fireworks. Jackson got a bit ham-handed with his magic. Saruman's possession of Theoden not only didn't make sense (between raising an army and talking to Sauron, where did Saruman get the time to keep Theoden senile and old-looking?), it was nothing like any other magic in the book. At one point, Frodo throws an elven cloak over himself and Sam, making them look like a big rock, down to the rough surface and rocky shape. In the book, Pippin actually makes a point of asking if the cloaks are magic and is told that the cloaks just tend to change hues with the environment. Nothing is said about magical shape changing.I could go on, but let me just finish by saying that I would still recommend this film, if only to make the bridge between The Fellowship of the Ring and the (hopefully better) Return of the King, but if seeing a movie that's faithful to the book is particularly important to you, get your booing muscles ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson, have mercy. . .(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that I had been sitting in the theater, watching "The Two Towers", for a very long time --much longer than the usual time a modern person's body clock allows for watching a single movie. So when a certain blackout occurred on the screen --despite the fact that I knew that there was more story still to go in the book of "The Two Towers", that Frodo and Sam had still to meet "Her", that Gandalf had still to confront Saruman and both Pippin and Aragorn to look in the Palantir of Orthanc-- despite all the story left to be told, I eyed this particular blackout on the screen with trepidation, and drew back in my chair, holding my breath. And then, came the words I knew must come and yet hoped might be delayed just a little longer. They were the first words of the ending credits, telling me that the film I had just seen, which was now over, had been directed by Peter Jackson. I let out my breath. Yes, I thought. It is over.And then I thought: I AM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE I SEE THE REST OF THIS FILM.Peter Jackson, couldn't you make a nice Summer 2003 release of The Return of the King? Huh? Please?I won't even bother to rave and gush about how great this film was. Everyone else is already doing it for me, and it kind of goes without saying. However, I wouldn't be the true LOTR geek that I am if I didn't quibble just a little bit about a few minor things. In no order of importance: (1) the Jackson-fabricated bit where Aragorn falls over the cliff and is telepathically "resurrected" by Arwen was completely unnecessary. Also, between that bit and what has already happened to Gandalf, there is a danger of oversaturating and therefore desensitizing the audience. How many more characters can we expect to fall a great distance and be given up for dead, only to make a spectacular, emotional comeback? Speaking of which, (2) the return of Gandalf, and particularly the revelation of Gandalf to the others in the Fellowship, is treated with very broad swift strokes in this film. (3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli). (4) Eowyn is far too sunny and "girlish". All that "poison" that Wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. She's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) While I understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having Faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath, intending to bring the Ring as a weapon to Gondor, I wish Peter Jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast Faramir in such a bad light. In the book, Faramir "shows his quality" by rejecting the Ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. Why must he be so much weaker in the film? And finally, (6) Huorns!! Where are the Huorns? Don't tell me, Peter Jackson, that you can make CGI mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and Gollum and Ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking Orc-swallowing demon forest??But seriously, a summer release for Return of the King. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best 9 i could ever give</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to rate this movie because it doesn't seem like a separate movie. Although I'm a huge fan of lord of the rings i gave this one a 9. The only real drawback was that it skipped around way too much. Every time I started to get into one scene it would switch to something else. Of course the scenery, special effects, the attention to detail, costumes, weapons, armor, the CGI , and the list goes on was the best of the best the only drawback, like i said, was that it just skipped around as soon as i got into it. It made the fight scenes less memorable unlike the first one. Still a VERY VERY f***in BADA** movie that you HAVE TO see. The movie still feels like a legend being brought to life. Its definetly an experience. I need to see it mmm... 6 more times within the next 10 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming the ending of an Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darkness. Bleakness. Age. The final mustering of strength of a weary warrior and of weary, ruined kingdoms long past their splendor. The end of an Age of the world. That is what the Two Towers invokes. Watching this film reminded me in a way that Fellowship did not that I am witnessing before my eyes the end of the Third Age. That is what this film is about. The darkness is not just the darkness of Mordor consuming Middle Earth, it is the darkness and bleakness of the end of an Age. Yes, elves are leaving Middle Earth. But, men and the kingdom of men also seem at their end, long past their glory. These ancient, worn kingdoms of men seem called upon to master their last strength, strength that is long past its glory; their kingdoms seem shadows, ruins, remnants of their former glory. Even when Theoden is no longer "possessed", Rohan and Theoden still seem past their glory, weary warriors, Rohan seems a weary kingdom, devoid of life, at the end of its days, gray and worn, devoid of many people. There are no teeming multitudes in Rohan. It seems an empty cold, windy chilled plain, a barren land. Osgilath, the ruined city of Gondor is in decay. Even the sky throughout the film is gray and bleak, like a gray, depressing November or December day at the end of a year, the dying season, winter. Sams words at the end of the film (pulled directly from the book) echoes this theme, what will there be left to save at the end? Will anything that once was remain the same? All will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as PJ has already hinted at for the Return of the King and as readers of the books already know. This is a movie about war. In this, it is much different than Fellowship of the Ring. Fellowship of the Ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. Two Towers, as PJ said, is a movie about men, about warfare. The movie, for me, at least, centers around Rohan and Theoden and Aragon (and Faramir) and the war of men (Rohan and Gondor) against Saruman and Mordor. This movie is much less Frodo-centric than Fellowship of the Ring. I remember in the DVD of Fellowship that Phillipa said that Fellowship was rewritten to make all the story Frodo-centric, centered around Frodo and the ring. While Frodo is still important in the Two Towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on Rohan and the plight of men (the plight of Osgilath and Farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. Gondor and Rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. When the banner of Rohan falls before Aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of Middle Earth at the time of the film. To me, the main characters in this film are Theoden and Aragon, the old king of Rohan and the future king of Gondor. In Theoden we see the passing of the Third Age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in Germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. He is torn about leading his people to war. He knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. He might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. I found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic. Viggo again does a wonderful job as Aragon. As for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. John Rhyss-Davies is hilarious as Gimli. I love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of Fellowship and not returned to Fellowship until the extended DVD. As for Gollum, I did not find him as believable as many people have stated. Throughout he seemed to me CGI. However, in close ups of his face, he did look like Andy Serkis. Truly this was an actor acting Gollum when we focused on Gollum's face. I felt pity for Smeagol and terror of Gollum. PJ does a great job at the turmoil of Smeagol/Gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how Gollum is what Frodo is already becoming because of his "addiction" to the ring. I did not find the changes to Faramir's character jarring. I had always found the Faramir section of the Two Towers rather boring, so I liked that there was more tension involved. In the end, Faramir is the Faramir that we know from the books. He doesn't give in to the ring. &gt; The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with Arwen. I did however think the scene where we see Arwen and Elrond together and Arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film. As for the Ents, Treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. Some of the other Ents however looked a little "cutesy". I did have some misgivings that the Ents did not after Entmoot say right away that they would attack Saruman, but having Pippin and Merry lead Treebeard toward Orthanc to show him the desolation Saruman had created does give Pippin and Merry a more important role to play. We do get to see Pippin and Merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of Theoden/Aragon and the other of Frodo/Golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer). Gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. Again, I think because the script was written toward focusing on the Aragon and Theoden comparison and the Frodo and Gollum comparison. On the whole this is a very different film from Fellowship. Fellowship was about Frodo. This is about the ending of an Age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times. Did I like it? Yes. But for different reasons than Fellowship because this is a very different film than Fellowship as PJ has said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Stopping Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To try and describe this incredible work of genius with words would be a fruitless and futile effort. There are times throughout history when some things shine so brilliant, when some things stand so far above the rest that you can only stand back and admire in awe of thier perfection and greatness. This is one of those times. LOTR The two towers is a jaw-dropping thrill ride...that will push the limits of imagination and bring you into a world where the line between the screen and real life is eliminated. You will become the story. This must by any standards be the most visually stunning and impressive movie ever created. The effects and visual mastery have reached the point of perfection, and the boundless detail and special effect vividness have passed the point of imagination. At three hours, the film is packed with enough storyline and visual effects for 100 movies. The three hours, however, will blink by in the wink of an eye. The script and storyline are flawless, the movie has simply everything that is great and good in cinema, mind-numbing special effects, chracters to be remembered forever, and gripping power. If you can only see a few films in a lifetime...see this masterpiece. For those of you who do not like it, I would recommend you to not watch movies.for nothing will please you. This movie cannot really be described, it is something you just have to see for yourself. Unbelievable.</fullReview>

That said, this piece of art is simply breathtaking - awesome!"Two Towers" tells the middle part of "The Lord of the Rings" with great imagery and love for details. The story focuses on the lands of Rohan and struggle of its people to survive, while switching every now and then to accompany Frodo.Just one more thing - GOLLUM - cg character with acting, with emotions, you wont believe how good this is until you have seen him yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen this year. Now I am not even a fan of Tolkien's book -- never read the tale. But I was just captivated by this. It is epic movie making at its best. The battle scene at the end was just UNBELIEVABLE.I first saw Akira Kurasawa's "Seven Samurai" in college, and the relentless battles staged in "Two Towers" reminded me of those in the Japanese firm. In the "Two Towers" they are just as skillfully directed and edited, but they are SO MUCH GRANDER from the technology and money of today's Hollywood. This movie testifies to the dominance of Hollywood in the world entertainment. It is a sheer joy to be transported to the fantasy world on Middle Earth!</fullReview>

(3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli). (4) Eowyn is far too sunny and "girlish". All that "poison" that Wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. She's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) While I understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having Faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath, intending to bring the Ring as a weapon to Gondor, I wish Peter Jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast Faramir in such a bad light. In the book, Faramir "shows his quality" by rejecting the Ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. Why must he be so much weaker in the film? And finally, (6) Huorns!! Where are the Huorns? Don't tell me, Peter Jackson, that you can make CGI mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and Gollum and Ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking Orc-swallowing demon forest??But seriously, a summer release for Return of the King. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best 9 i could ever give</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to rate this movie because it doesn't seem like a separate movie. Although I'm a huge fan of lord of the rings i gave this one a 9. The only real drawback was that it skipped around way too much. Every time I started to get into one scene it would switch to something else. Of course the scenery, special effects, the attention to detail, costumes, weapons, armor, the CGI , and the list goes on was the best of the best the only drawback, like i said, was that it just skipped around as soon as i got into it. It made the fight scenes less memorable unlike the first one. Still a VERY VERY f***in BADA** movie that you HAVE TO see. The movie still feels like a legend being brought to life. Its definetly an experience. I need to see it mmm... 6 more times within the next 10 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming the ending of an Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darkness. Bleakness. Age. The final mustering of strength of a weary warrior and of weary, ruined kingdoms long past their splendor. The end of an Age of the world. That is what the Two Towers invokes. Watching this film reminded me in a way that Fellowship did not that I am witnessing before my eyes the end of the Third Age. That is what this film is about. The darkness is not just the darkness of Mordor consuming Middle Earth, it is the darkness and bleakness of the end of an Age. Yes, elves are leaving Middle Earth. But, men and the kingdom of men also seem at their end, long past their glory. These ancient, worn kingdoms of men seem called upon to master their last strength, strength that is long past its glory; their kingdoms seem shadows, ruins, remnants of their former glory. Even when Theoden is no longer "possessed", Rohan and Theoden still seem past their glory, weary warriors, Rohan seems a weary kingdom, devoid of life, at the end of its days, gray and worn, devoid of many people. There are no teeming multitudes in Rohan. It seems an empty cold, windy chilled plain, a barren land. Osgilath, the ruined city of Gondor is in decay. Even the sky throughout the film is gray and bleak, like a gray, depressing November or December day at the end of a year, the dying season, winter. Sams words at the end of the film (pulled directly from the book) echoes this theme, what will there be left to save at the end? Will anything that once was remain the same? All will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as PJ has already hinted at for the Return of the King and as readers of the books already know. This is a movie about war. In this, it is much different than Fellowship of the Ring. Fellowship of the Ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. Two Towers, as PJ said, is a movie about men, about warfare. The movie, for me, at least, centers around Rohan and Theoden and Aragon (and Faramir) and the war of men (Rohan and Gondor) against Saruman and Mordor. This movie is much less Frodo-centric than Fellowship of the Ring. I remember in the DVD of Fellowship that Phillipa said that Fellowship was rewritten to make all the story Frodo-centric, centered around Frodo and the ring. While Frodo is still important in the Two Towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on Rohan and the plight of men (the plight of Osgilath and Farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. Gondor and Rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. When the banner of Rohan falls before Aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of Middle Earth at the time of the film. To me, the main characters in this film are Theoden and Aragon, the old king of Rohan and the future king of Gondor. In Theoden we see the passing of the Third Age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in Germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. He is torn about leading his people to war. He knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. He might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. I found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic. Viggo again does a wonderful job as Aragon. As for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. John Rhyss-Davies is hilarious as Gimli. I love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of Fellowship and not returned to Fellowship until the extended DVD. As for Gollum, I did not find him as believable as many people have stated. Throughout he seemed to me CGI. However, in close ups of his face, he did look like Andy Serkis. Truly this was an actor acting Gollum when we focused on Gollum's face. I felt pity for Smeagol and terror of Gollum. PJ does a great job at the turmoil of Smeagol/Gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how Gollum is what Frodo is already becoming because of his "addiction" to the ring. I did not find the changes to Faramir's character jarring. I had always found the Faramir section of the Two Towers rather boring, so I liked that there was more tension involved. In the end, Faramir is the Faramir that we know from the books. He doesn't give in to the ring. &gt; The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with Arwen. I did however think the scene where we see Arwen and Elrond together and Arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film. As for the Ents, Treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. Some of the other Ents however looked a little "cutesy". I did have some misgivings that the Ents did not after Entmoot say right away that they would attack Saruman, but having Pippin and Merry lead Treebeard toward Orthanc to show him the desolation Saruman had created does give Pippin and Merry a more important role to play. We do get to see Pippin and Merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of Theoden/Aragon and the other of Frodo/Golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer). Gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. Again, I think because the script was written toward focusing on the Aragon and Theoden comparison and the Frodo and Gollum comparison. On the whole this is a very different film from Fellowship. Fellowship was about Frodo. This is about the ending of an Age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times. Did I like it? Yes. But for different reasons than Fellowship because this is a very different film than Fellowship as PJ has said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To try and describe this incredible work of genius with words would be a fruitless and futile effort. There are times throughout history when some things shine so brilliant, when some things stand so far above the rest that you can only stand back and admire in awe of thier perfection and greatness. This is one of those times. LOTR The two towers is a jaw-dropping thrill ride...that will push the limits of imagination and bring you into a world where the line between the screen and real life is eliminated. You will become the story. This must by any standards be the most visually stunning and impressive movie ever created. The effects and visual mastery have reached the point of perfection, and the boundless detail and special effect vividness have passed the point of imagination. At three hours, the film is packed with enough storyline and visual effects for 100 movies. The three hours, however, will blink by in the wink of an eye. The script and storyline are flawless, the movie has simply everything that is great and good in cinema, mind-numbing special effects, chracters to be remembered forever, and gripping power. If you can only see a few films in a lifetime...see this masterpiece. For those of you who do not like it, I would recommend you to not watch movies.for nothing will please you. This movie cannot really be described, it is something you just have to see for yourself. Unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're going to base a movie on a book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that there is no argument that Jackson has a lot of technical skill. The movie was extremely well done, was acted well, and had great special effects, Gollum especially. It's also plain that in order to fit these movies into three hours, a lot of editing had to be done, not only to make it fit, but also to modify the story for the silver screen. Having said that, I have to say that I was not happy with the changes that Jackson made.What's the point of claiming to be based on a book if you're not going to be faithful to the spirit of the original? If you go to see something being touted as a James Bond film and the main character is a five-year old girl, you have a right to be upset. Not that Jackson went to this extreme, but my point is that there is certainly grounds to complain about the changes. One of the things that I love about Tolkein's books is the depth of the detail. I feel like I KNOW Tolkein's world. I was upset, then, when I realized that what was on the screen was no longer Tolkein's world, but Jackson's. If you haven't yet seen this film, I would say go ahead and see it anyway, but if you're a purist, be prepared to get p***ed off. I managed to keep myself from booing until the end. Barely.*********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***********There are parts of Tolkein's mythos that Jackson completely ignored. For instance, one of the themes of Lord of the Rings was that the age of the elves was coming to an end. There's a reason why they do almost nothing as a race throughout the book. Why then, do they show up in the movie at Helm's Deep? Perhaps so that Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel can have more of a reason for showing up in the film at all! I wonder if a certain amount of screen time was written into their contracts.Also, the magic in Tolkein's world, both wizardly and elven, was a subtle kind, except perhaps for Gandalf's fireworks. Jackson got a bit ham-handed with his magic. Saruman's possession of Theoden not only didn't make sense (between raising an army and talking to Sauron, where did Saruman get the time to keep Theoden senile and old-looking?), it was nothing like any other magic in the book. At one point, Frodo throws an elven cloak over himself and Sam, making them look like a big rock, down to the rough surface and rocky shape. In the book, Pippin actually makes a point of asking if the cloaks are magic and is told that the cloaks just tend to change hues with the environment. Nothing is said about magical shape changing.I could go on, but let me just finish by saying that I would still recommend this film, if only to make the bridge between The Fellowship of the Ring and the (hopefully better) Return of the King, but if seeing a movie that's faithful to the book is particularly important to you, get your booing muscles ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson, have mercy. . .(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that I had been sitting in the theater, watching "The Two Towers", for a very long time --much longer than the usual time a modern person's body clock allows for watching a single movie. So when a certain blackout occurred on the screen --despite the fact that I knew that there was more story still to go in the book of "The Two Towers", that Frodo and Sam had still to meet "Her", that Gandalf had still to confront Saruman and both Pippin and Aragorn to look in the Palantir of Orthanc-- despite all the story left to be told, I eyed this particular blackout on the screen with trepidation, and drew back in my chair, holding my breath. And then, came the words I knew must come and yet hoped might be delayed just a little longer. They were the first words of the ending credits, telling me that the film I had just seen, which was now over, had been directed by Peter Jackson. I let out my breath. Yes, I thought. It is over.And then I thought: I AM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE I SEE THE REST OF THIS FILM.Peter Jackson, couldn't you make a nice Summer 2003 release of The Return of the King? Huh? Please?I won't even bother to rave and gush about how great this film was. Everyone else is already doing it for me, and it kind of goes without saying. However, I wouldn't be the true LOTR geek that I am if I didn't quibble just a little bit about a few minor things. In no order of importance: (1) the Jackson-fabricated bit where Aragorn falls over the cliff and is telepathically "resurrected" by Arwen was completely unnecessary. Also, between that bit and what has already happened to Gandalf, there is a danger of oversaturating and therefore desensitizing the audience. How many more characters can we expect to fall a great distance and be given up for dead, only to make a spectacular, emotional comeback? Speaking of which, (2) the return of Gandalf, and particularly the revelation of Gandalf to the others in the Fellowship, is treated with very broad swift strokes in this film. (3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli).

		<shortDescription>The Oscar for Best Picture goes to.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson has come through with probably the best sequel ever filmed. This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. The action sequences, special effects, and acting are almost flawless. Peter Jackson has diverted from the book a bit more here in this installment, but bringing a series like this to film would not be possible without rearranging scenes and adding and subtracting scenes. The old saying is true: "It looked good on paper...". This team is doing all of the right things here. From the wondrous opening scenes of Middle-Earth to the dark hell of Helms Deep, this is a historical moment in film! This epic-series will re-define film-making in the future. The performances in this film are top-notch and are not diminished by the special-effects. Gollum is perhaps the best secret of this film. This is not just another clunky digital character. Gollum appears as life-like as anything else on the screen. His facial expression and detail are a major achievement in film. His performance (which was provided by an actor on the set) is amazing. His battle with his personal evils concerning the ring are truly as believable as if his character was played by a human actor. Our three mismatched warriors all shine as we see more character development. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are true heroes of the silver screen. Don't miss the scene where Legolas jumps up on to a running horse. Wow! These characters show strong bonds of friendship overcoming the prejudices of there respective races. Great new characters, wonderful performances, outstanding special-effects, breathlessly paced. What a wonderful Christmas present for 2002. A film about honor and hope. Who says you can't learn anything from going to the movies? What a great ride. Do not miss this film!</fullReview>

Gimli's too many jokes and some unnecessary slapstick-like scenes as Legolas surfing on a shield take out the dramatic of the battle scenes, too. Unfortunately the question "More Saruman hasn't to offer?!?" that somebody expresses during the fight is justified.At the end the battle is suddenly over and I didn't have the impression that there was an intensive fight before. Although it was brilliantly animated I was a little bit disappointed of the battle of Helm's Deep!All in all the movie still is great! Let's say 9/10...</fullReview>

Yes, they did not develop some of the people as much as I wanted, but then again, this book just has too much information in it, and realistically, I will not be able to see it in a 3 hour movie. I still loved this movie.And when we saw Legolas swing up onto the moving horse with Gimli, my 6 year old son, 14 year old son and I, were just AMAZED. This elf rocks, made me feel bad for the humans...nahhh. Aragorn held his own, and Gimli was like a tank -loved how they kept the "orc count" alive from the book.My family will go see this movie again, as there is just so much to it. Read the books, see this movie (in sequence from the 1st movie). This epic will be around for a long time to come as nothing has come close to it.BTW Gollum's conversation was awesome. I really felt as Frodo felt; I felt pity for him while also loathing him. They did a great job with this construct. Almost brings tears to my eyes....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated movies of all time finally released in the theaters. In my opinion, all expectations were fulfilled to the max...We follow Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in their pursuit of Merry &amp; Pippin and the orcs, and later the magnificent, and I don't hesitate in calling it epic, battle for Helms Deep.Simultaneously Frodo and Sam struggle with their difficult way to Mordor, and meet Gollum, who is the best character in the whole film. The characterization of his schizophrenic tendencies are filled with humour, goodwill and horror. Really GREAT!Last but not least, we are shown what the ents look like, and how they destroy Isengard, the fortress of the treacherous wizard Saruman.These three plots are brilliantly mixed together so that we see a bit of each plot, which give a good variation as you don't get tired of one scene/plot.I can only say(as I said with The Fellowship of the Ring): Go see it, and if you already have seen it, go see it again and again and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are down sides to this film. The acting is not Oscar worthy, the script is no way near as good as the original book and the story can seem fragmented at times. But for pure visual glory, this film has to ranked right up there with the best. If you take out the absolutely massive battle scenes, you still have the wonderful Smeagol/Gollum character. If you take out the breathtaking views of middle earth you still have the breaking of Isengard. Rarely, especially in these times does a director so clearly belong to the telling of one story. With Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson this is true in spades. Bring on the Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Near the end of "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Sam Gamgee, the ever-loyal companion of Frodo Baggins, talks about stories: the "great stories" about darkness and despair, courage and triumph, the stories that help us find hope when we think we've lost it. When he wonders if Frodo will ever be the subject of such a tale, the audience laughs knowingly, because "Lord of the Rings" is indeed one of the great stories--the folklore of our culture, if you will. There is a quality about the tale that is marvelously fantastic and yet at the same time, deeply relevant to the world we live in. And it's fitting that so great a story be given so glorious an interpretation as Peter Jackson's film trilogy of the books is turning out to be."Two Towers" essentially picks up where "Fellowship of the Ring" left off: the Fellowship is splintered, and the various factions are doing their part to prevent the ultimate evil from engulfing Middle-Earth. The one fault of the film various threads of the story become difficult to juggle, at times interrupting each other with something just this side of abruptness. But with a high-caliber cast and a world that nearly bursts from the screen with its vivid grandeur, it's hard to complain too much.Most of the film follows Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen)--who has returned, almost Christ-like, from seemingly certain death--as they attempt to guard the equestrian-based people of Rohan from the armies of darkness. The threat is internal as well as external: an oily agent of the wizard Saruman, aptly named "Wormtongue" (Brad Dourif) has insinuated himself into the house of Rohan's king. The performances from the returning cast are excellent across the board, and are complimented by the newcomers: Dourif, Bernard Hill as the king, and Karl Urban and Miranda Otto as his brave nephew and niece. The fight for Rohan culmitates in the climactic battle at Helm's Deep, where rank upon rank of vicious orcs throw themselves at the outnumbered heroes who fight with nearly superhuman strength and courage.Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the Ring which has the power to enslave Middle-Earth. Guiding them is Gollem, an emaciated creature and a previous Ring-Bearer, who has become twisted by years of exposure to its corruption. A highlight of the film, Gollem is arguably the most impressive CGI character in a live-action film, both on the technical and the character levels. Creepy yet pathetic, the schitzophrenic Gollem wavers between eagerly helping Frodo on his quest and plotting to kill the `nasty hobbitses' and reclaim his precious Ring. In a film teeming with special effects, the subtle changes in Gollem's face and manner as his personality shifts are probably the most effective. The remaining two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, spend much of their segments among the Ents, mobile, sentient trees who all but equal Gollem for technical merit and potency.In all fantasy films, the visual element is a key factor, and `Two Towers' repeats the awe-inspiring brilliance of `Fellowship.' Along with `Harry Potter' and `Spirited Away,' this ranks as one of the most beautiful sights of the screen this year. There are `oooh' moments aplenty: characters trudge through magnificent landscapes, enormous towers stand threateningly over vast wastelands, huge armies stretch to the horizon in seething masses of humanity (or more frequently, non-humanity). But when we zoom in for a closer look, we find stunning and meticulous detail-a flourish of the architecture, the shape of the weaponry, the trim on the costumes-which truly gives Middle-Earth a sense of depth. Tolkien also had such an eye for detail, painstakingly creating the histories and cultures of his characters with loving artistry. And this is perhaps one of the many reasons why `Lord of the Rings'-both books and movies-stand out as landmarks, not only in the fantasy genre but in literature and film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great special-effects, great acting, most of the time suspense-packed, but unfortunately I could not find much of the often cited "darkness" in this movie...The "bad guys", Orks and Uruk-hais, surely look great but anyway they don't have a threatening effect on me...At the final battle at Helm's Deep they can be easily killed in dozens like in a computer game but on the other side one can see hardly no men or elbs dying or even have a brutal fight. Gimli's too many jokes and some unnecessary slapstick-like scenes as Legolas surfing on a shield take out the dramatic of the battle scenes, too. Unfortunately the question "More Saruman hasn't to offer?!?" that somebody expresses during the fight is justified.At the end the battle is suddenly over and I didn't have the impression that there was an intensive fight before. Although it was brilliantly animated I was a little bit disappointed of the battle of Helm's Deep!All in all the movie still is great! Let's say 9/10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes there are points where the movie diverges from the book, but WHO CARES!! Yes, they did not develop some of the people as much as I wanted, but then again, this book just has too much information in it, and realistically, I will not be able to see it in a 3 hour movie. I still loved this movie.And when we saw Legolas swing up onto the moving horse with Gimli, my 6 year old son, 14 year old son and I, were just AMAZED. This elf rocks, made me feel bad for the humans...nahhh. Aragorn held his own, and Gimli was like a tank -loved how they kept the "orc count" alive from the book.My family will go see this movie again, as there is just so much to it. Read the books, see this movie (in sequence from the 1st movie). This epic will be around for a long time to come as nothing has come close to it.BTW Gollum's conversation was awesome. I really felt as Frodo felt; I felt pity for him while also loathing him. They did a great job with this construct. Almost brings tears to my eyes....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring is back, BETTER than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated movies of all time finally released in the theaters. In my opinion, all expectations were fulfilled to the max...We follow Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in their pursuit of Merry &amp; Pippin and the orcs, and later the magnificent, and I don't hesitate in calling it epic, battle for Helms Deep.Simultaneously Frodo and Sam struggle with their difficult way to Mordor, and meet Gollum, who is the best character in the whole film. The characterization of his schizophrenic tendencies are filled with humour, goodwill and horror. Really GREAT!Last but not least, we are shown what the ents look like, and how they destroy Isengard, the fortress of the treacherous wizard Saruman.These three plots are brilliantly mixed together so that we see a bit of each plot, which give a good variation as you don't get tired of one scene/plot.I can only say(as I said with The Fellowship of the Ring): Go see it, and if you already have seen it, go see it again and again and again...</fullReview>

Yes, they did not develop some of the people as much as I wanted, but then again, this book just has too much information in it, and realistically, I will not be able to see it in a 3 hour movie. I still loved this movie.And when we saw Legolas swing up onto the moving horse with Gimli, my 6 year old son, 14 year old son and I, were just AMAZED. This elf rocks, made me feel bad for the humans...nahhh. Aragorn held his own, and Gimli was like a tank -loved how they kept the "orc count" alive from the book.My family will go see this movie again, as there is just so much to it. Read the books, see this movie (in sequence from the 1st movie). This epic will be around for a long time to come as nothing has come close to it.BTW Gollum's conversation was awesome.

		<fullReview>I don't think that The Two Towers tops the first movie in the trilogi. But I do think that it is just as good as Fellowship. It is indeed a brilliant and amazing movie of some spectacle, made with a lot of respect for the world of Tolkien.

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinematic Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are down sides to this film. The acting is not Oscar worthy, the script is no way near as good as the original book and the story can seem fragmented at times. But for pure visual glory, this film has to ranked right up there with the best. If you take out the absolutely massive battle scenes, you still have the wonderful Smeagol/Gollum character. If you take out the breathtaking views of middle earth you still have the breaking of Isengard. Rarely, especially in these times does a director so clearly belong to the telling of one story. With Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson this is true in spades. Bring on the Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Near the end of "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Sam Gamgee, the ever-loyal companion of Frodo Baggins, talks about stories: the "great stories" about darkness and despair, courage and triumph, the stories that help us find hope when we think we've lost it. When he wonders if Frodo will ever be the subject of such a tale, the audience laughs knowingly, because "Lord of the Rings" is indeed one of the great stories--the folklore of our culture, if you will. There is a quality about the tale that is marvelously fantastic and yet at the same time, deeply relevant to the world we live in. And it's fitting that so great a story be given so glorious an interpretation as Peter Jackson's film trilogy of the books is turning out to be."Two Towers" essentially picks up where "Fellowship of the Ring" left off: the Fellowship is splintered, and the various factions are doing their part to prevent the ultimate evil from engulfing Middle-Earth. The one fault of the film various threads of the story become difficult to juggle, at times interrupting each other with something just this side of abruptness. But with a high-caliber cast and a world that nearly bursts from the screen with its vivid grandeur, it's hard to complain too much.Most of the film follows Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen)--who has returned, almost Christ-like, from seemingly certain death--as they attempt to guard the equestrian-based people of Rohan from the armies of darkness. The threat is internal as well as external: an oily agent of the wizard Saruman, aptly named "Wormtongue" (Brad Dourif) has insinuated himself into the house of Rohan's king. The performances from the returning cast are excellent across the board, and are complimented by the newcomers: Dourif, Bernard Hill as the king, and Karl Urban and Miranda Otto as his brave nephew and niece. The fight for Rohan culmitates in the climactic battle at Helm's Deep, where rank upon rank of vicious orcs throw themselves at the outnumbered heroes who fight with nearly superhuman strength and courage.Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the Ring which has the power to enslave Middle-Earth. Guiding them is Gollem, an emaciated creature and a previous Ring-Bearer, who has become twisted by years of exposure to its corruption. A highlight of the film, Gollem is arguably the most impressive CGI character in a live-action film, both on the technical and the character levels. Creepy yet pathetic, the schitzophrenic Gollem wavers between eagerly helping Frodo on his quest and plotting to kill the `nasty hobbitses' and reclaim his precious Ring. In a film teeming with special effects, the subtle changes in Gollem's face and manner as his personality shifts are probably the most effective. The remaining two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, spend much of their segments among the Ents, mobile, sentient trees who all but equal Gollem for technical merit and potency.In all fantasy films, the visual element is a key factor, and `Two Towers' repeats the awe-inspiring brilliance of `Fellowship.' Along with `Harry Potter' and `Spirited Away,' this ranks as one of the most beautiful sights of the screen this year. There are `oooh' moments aplenty: characters trudge through magnificent landscapes, enormous towers stand threateningly over vast wastelands, huge armies stretch to the horizon in seething masses of humanity (or more frequently, non-humanity). But when we zoom in for a closer look, we find stunning and meticulous detail-a flourish of the architecture, the shape of the weaponry, the trim on the costumes-which truly gives Middle-Earth a sense of depth. Tolkien also had such an eye for detail, painstakingly creating the histories and cultures of his characters with loving artistry. And this is perhaps one of the many reasons why `Lord of the Rings'-both books and movies-stand out as landmarks, not only in the fantasy genre but in literature and film in general.</fullReview>

Gimli's too many jokes and some unnecessary slapstick-like scenes as Legolas surfing on a shield take out the dramatic of the battle scenes, too. Unfortunately the question "More Saruman hasn't to offer?!?" that somebody expresses during the fight is justified.At the end the battle is suddenly over and I didn't have the impression that there was an intensive fight before. Although it was brilliantly animated I was a little bit disappointed of the battle of Helm's Deep!All in all the movie still is great! Let's say 9/10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes there are points where the movie diverges from the book, but WHO CARES!! Yes, they did not develop some of the people as much as I wanted, but then again, this book just has too much information in it, and realistically, I will not be able to see it in a 3 hour movie. I still loved this movie.And when we saw Legolas swing up onto the moving horse with Gimli, my 6 year old son, 14 year old son and I, were just AMAZED. This elf rocks, made me feel bad for the humans...nahhh. Aragorn held his own, and Gimli was like a tank -loved how they kept the "orc count" alive from the book.My family will go see this movie again, as there is just so much to it. Read the books, see this movie (in sequence from the 1st movie). This epic will be around for a long time to come as nothing has come close to it.BTW Gollum's conversation was awesome. I really felt as Frodo felt; I felt pity for him while also loathing him. They did a great job with this construct. Almost brings tears to my eyes....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring is back, BETTER than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated movies of all time finally released in the theaters. In my opinion, all expectations were fulfilled to the max...We follow Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in their pursuit of Merry &amp; Pippin and the orcs, and later the magnificent, and I don't hesitate in calling it epic, battle for Helms Deep.Simultaneously Frodo and Sam struggle with their difficult way to Mordor, and meet Gollum, who is the best character in the whole film. The characterization of his schizophrenic tendencies are filled with humour, goodwill and horror. Really GREAT!Last but not least, we are shown what the ents look like, and how they destroy Isengard, the fortress of the treacherous wizard Saruman.These three plots are brilliantly mixed together so that we see a bit of each plot, which give a good variation as you don't get tired of one scene/plot.I can only say(as I said with The Fellowship of the Ring): Go see it, and if you already have seen it, go see it again and again and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most spectacular movies i have ever seen. It certainly is a lot better than the first one, during which i dozed off occaisionally. In this movie, you get no chance for that! The battle of Helmsdeep comes in my top five of most spectacular action scenes ever; (the chariot race from Ben-Hur is still number one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This installment of the trilogy is a greater achievement than the first because it was so much harder to do. It's the middle of a story, and I don't think we have another film to compare it to. The fact that most viewers accept where it "starts" and where it "ends" is just amazing. I have read the trilogy several times, and I have to point out to those who quibble about the departures from the text that "The Wizard of Oz" takes infinitely greater liberties with its text, and who mentions that as a flaw in the movie? The movie works, Jackson's a genius, and hopefully by spring 2004 the academy will have figured out some way to honor this unprecedented piece of moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best movie I have seen in my entire life. It is what we call a cinematic breakthrough. It has everything a movie needs. The Two Towers has action, drama, all that jazz. It combines everything good from an action movie with everything good from a drama movie and rolls it into a tasty package much like a froot roll up. I will see this movie many many times. Too many to count. Will it break my record of seeing the phantom menace 52 times? Probably not because I can't stomach a movie that many times any more. But this is certainly the best movie I have seen in my life. If it doesn't win best picture than I will know the academy is just a bunch of pretentious art loving fools who cant give a good film the nod for best picture because it has a little action in it.

And oh yeah, Saruman still has power and we don't even really know anything about Sauron. Yet, the hobbits and dwarfs provide enough comic relief to keep the movie going.

		<shortDescription>Great Movie with some dissapointing changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was a great movie, but there were 2 changes from the book that bothered me. First, Arwen didn't need to be such a big character. I think this movie would have done just as well or better without her. I think she slowed it down more than anything else.Second, Faramir's character was completely changed. In the book he shows the strength of his character by letting Frodo, Sam and Gollum go on their way while in the movie he leads them to Gondor. The problem is that the movie portrays him as being just like his brother Boromir rather than a man of greater strength and the will to do what is right and best for Middle Earth.I also found the beginning to be a bit confusing because of how they jumped right into the story without any real recap. However, I understand that it had to be done this way and am glad they didn't have any sort of re-cap. Eventually you get into the flow of things and everything falls into place. I think it would be neat if after all three movies are out they make a DVD edition with all three movies edited into one great long movie with no pause between the three original films. You would be crazy to sit though it all in one sitting (and would likely end up with bed sores or something) but I think it would be interesting.However, despite my complaints I thought it was a great movie - much better than the first. I thought that Gollum stole the show. They did an excellent job of portraying his internal struggles and contradiction. I would like to have seen more of then Ents. It's unfortunate that Merry and Pippin didn't get to drink his nectar and grow taller, but that scene would have likely slowed the movie.Despite my complaints I plan on seeing this movie at least once more while it is still in the theaters and I can't wait for the DVD to come out.</fullReview>

I will see this movie many many times. Too many to count. Will it break my record of seeing the phantom menace 52 times? Probably not because I can't stomach a movie that many times any more. But this is certainly the best movie I have seen in my life. If it doesn't win best picture than I will know the academy is just a bunch of pretentious art loving fools who cant give a good film the nod for best picture because it has a little action in it. Go see this though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit I was a bit pretentious and anxious prior to seeing the second installment of Tolkien's epic adventure. So much so that I was shaking severely when the film started. I knew I was in for a treat. I was in it for the high adventure. I really wanted to enjoy this film.I saw the first installment of Jacksons LOTR TFOTR. Having read C.S. Lewis and John Tolkien's works throughout my life I have come to the realization of just how ballsy these authors portray real life. Yet it is done in a mythical Norse-like way. Now don't get me wrong, this is fantasy right? Seeing how our world today mirrors much of these themes, it is almost scary! Can you say "Iraq"?The beginning...As it first unfolds, the film depicts a rich sweeping arial view of the Mines of Moria. As the camera pans around the beautiful New Zealand mountain-range the camera fades into a recap of the battle that we all saw in the first movie between the Balrog and Gandalf the Grey. Looking back to that point (about 3/4 of the way in the first film) we are presented with an exact visual of Gandalf's cane being cast brilliantly to the ground. The Balrog has fallen yet the tip of the flame whip is ensnared around the wizards leg. Frodo screams out, but it is too late... Knowing what a good sevant of the gods must do, the wizard makes a split-second and wise decision to fight the evil Balrog in his own game. The Wizard is locked into mortal combat with this child of shadow. Gandalf and the beast fall through a chasm of forevermore depth towards the highest peak of the underworld. The victory is won, but is Gandalf unscathed?Thoughts...Ironically, the actors altruistic revelation of internal mythology is carefully interjected throughout the movie by Tolkien and is well translated by Peter Jackson for the big screen. It is a unplayed mindgame of Tolkiens designed to be an Easter-egg of sorts. For a movie, that is hard to do. This blatant outward realism of the books actually being present in a film is extraneous at best. Is this literary style prevalent in the films thusfar? Emphatically yes! It is quite a film. Dogmatically speaking, this film was an awesome visionary adaptation worthy of Tolkien and is well worth a few Oscars without a doubt. Well done Mr. Jackson!You want the climaz, anticlimax or just plain plot? Go see the movie!! I don't do spoilers out of respect for Peter Jackson and John Tolkien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a disappointment after the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the thickly-layered mountains of praise heaped upon "Fellowship of the Ring", perhaps it was inevitable that "The Two Towers" couldn't live up to it. And maybe I'm the only one who feels that it did not. Unfortunately, where "Fellowship" managed a near-perfect combination of the book's strengths with a good deal of shoring up to cover its weaknesses (sorry, Ringies, but it does have weaknesses), "Towers" shows all too many of the limitations of its source material, and the additions sadly weaken it even further.Certainly there's plenty to admire. The new characters are beautifully introduced and performed, particularly in the case of Miranda Otto as Eowyn, and a surprisingly sympathetic and complex rendition of Gollum, who could easily have been extremely irritating. The new characters, in fact, come off much better than the established ones. John Rhys Davies' Gimli suffers particularly, reduced to an almost Jar-Jar-like role of comic relief and battle buffoon. Also of note is the spectacular staging of the assault on Helm's Deep, surely one of the finest mass ground battles ever committed to film.However, there are many more mis-steps here than evident in the first film. A sequence in which Aragorn is separated from the party ultimately serves no purpose, as he simply experiences a flashback sequence and is quickly reunited with his friends. Why? In addition, the pacing is less even than that found in "Fellowship". Where that film managed to pace out its thrills in excellent beats with the story-driven scenes, this one makes the audience wait quite a bit longer for payoff. "The Two Towers" is more likely to test the patience of those not already enamored of Tolkien's world, as it's a long haul from the bombastic Balrog opening to the two battles that cap off the story. At the same time, the many liberties taken with the structure of the book (especially the characterization of Faramir) may put off the hardcore fans.Still, there are a lot of filmgoers out there who decided to unconditionally love this series long before the first chapter hit the screens, and I doubt that this will dim their enthusiasm. I can't wholeheartedly recommend "The Two Towers" for everyone, but that really won't stop anybody. As a means of getting from part one to part three, it does its job in an entertaining manner. Hopefully, "Return of the King" will bring us as rousing a conclusion as "Fellowship of the Ring" was an introduction. But this definitely represents a dip in the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning - SpoilersHow can a book so well known as this need a spoiler warning in its film review? Partly because Peter Jackson has (necessarily) changed the story in order to give the viewer some of the background story that Tolkien put in the appendices, and partly to make it more cinematic. I can put up with the need to include Liv Tyler, despite the fact that Arwen does not appear in the book at all, and I can just about put up with the film finishing a couple of chapters early - but why completely change a character? Faramir is made out to be some kind of monster, carrying on where his brother left off. To me the whole character in the book was the antithesis of Boromir, well cultured and studious, a character which will be required in the third film, but here this has been hindered by the handling of the minor part he played in this film.The effects in the film are generally good and I can't complain that they don't fit with my minds picture of them from the book. The Nazgul's flying beasts are superbly done, but the Gollum is unbelievably seemless. It is the best piece of CGI I have ever seen, and deserves an Oscar for that alone. A bit too cute for my liking (the Ralph Bakshi Gollum fit the character better for me) but Andy Serkis deserves the Oscar for supporting actor for the voice acting alone.Some of the other acting was a bit wooden in places (and I don't mean the Ents), Faramir for example, and Grima was just not acted at all, just the lines read out. Sam and Frodo didn't shine here either. Finally too much was made of the comedy of Gimli, here and there, yes, but one left the film feeling that he was a bit of a joke.Overall, 9 out of 10. Let's hope The Return of the King returns to the form shown in Fellowship.</fullReview>

My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected.

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie!

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out Lovers of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off.

(eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie and to be honest, I am going to have a hard time saying anything but .. "Holy sh....."..As I am partial to the fantasy genre and Tolkein is of course, the uber-master of such, this may be my favorite movie ever.. I can't think of a single thing negative to say about this movie..Scenery.. Amazing..Character Performances.. Deep.. Perfect.. Liv Tyler is amazing in her all-to-brief roles.. John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Movies go excellent but overall not faithful to the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project?

After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation.

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie!

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out Lovers of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected.

I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie and to be honest, I am going to have a hard time saying anything but .. "Holy sh....."..As I am partial to the fantasy genre and Tolkein is of course, the uber-master of such, this may be my favorite movie ever.. I can't think of a single thing negative to say about this movie..Scenery.. Amazing..Character Performances.. Deep.. Perfect.. Liv Tyler is amazing in her all-to-brief roles.. John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C.

This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter.

By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

I can't think of a single thing negative to say about this movie..Scenery.. Amazing..Character Performances.. Deep.. Perfect.. Liv Tyler is amazing in her all-to-brief roles.. John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought.

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Movies go excellent but overall not faithful to the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out Lovers of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie and to be honest, I am going to have a hard time saying anything but .. "Holy sh....."..As I am partial to the fantasy genre and Tolkein is of course, the uber-master of such, this may be my favorite movie ever.. I can't think of a single thing negative to say about this movie..Scenery.. Amazing..Character Performances.. Deep.. Perfect.. Liv Tyler is amazing in her all-to-brief roles.. John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV.

The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did he really change the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life. My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments. Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. And there are a fair number of them. The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be "Did Peter Jackson change the story?"Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. Someone will be disappointed with something. Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story? In my opinion, he didn't. He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out Lovers of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world.

I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep. If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun. The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits. Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts? How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details. The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc. But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well. And thats really the crux of it all. If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film. However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought. I wonder if anyone will actually read this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed. Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place. I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents. There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor. And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story. We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why. If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum. This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter. But then again what do I really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition. Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. Some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!". After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters. (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Gang,Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters &amp; detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up &amp; the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!</fullReview>

"Holy sh....."..As I am partial to the fantasy genre and Tolkein is of course, the uber-master of such, this may be my favorite movie ever.. I can't think of a single thing negative to say about this movie..Scenery.. Amazing..Character Performances.. Deep.. Perfect.. Liv Tyler is amazing in her all-to-brief roles.. John Rhys-Davis is great and for us fantasy fans, he's now the epitome of a dwarf..Battle Scenes.. Even Private Ryan didn't achieve this level, even relative to its own genre..One idea for Mr Jackson.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider bringing DRAGONLANCE to the screen after you are done with Tolkien and a well-deserved rest.. If only I could get a note to him.. If you like the fantasy genre, READ THAT SERIES.. I believe it to be the 2nd most influential fantasy series ever..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers vs Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel. First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones. Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world. The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie). The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing. Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda. I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene. The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake. The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi. The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific. Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance. The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones. The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline. So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Movies go excellent but overall not faithful to the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. I enjoyed it immensely. The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, "THAT was three hours!"I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made "right." After squirming through sludge that was the "Dungeons and Dragons" movie and "Willow," or seeing a fantasy like "Conan the Barbarian" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope "Lord of the Rings" opens up this new genre to other "realistic" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is "Willow" or "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Legend." I hope to see the "Dragonlance" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' "Shanara" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on "The Hobbit" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the "Tolken geeks" who are screaming at the "diversions" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made "authentically," hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of "Two Towers" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many "Tolkien geeks" on this board and ask them how they would feel if "normal" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, "okey dokey!" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every "Tolkien geek" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice on the eyes, hard on the Logic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Line Cinema's latest installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is a very pretty thing to look at, mostly. Those who know me, or are just seeking out `Radical Purist' views on the differences between the books and the movies need to scroll down a bit because I promised myself I would start this review from the standpoint of the filmmaking it's self.The boldness of Jackson and New Line in starting the film as they do, sans any prologue or synopsis of previous events, is admirable as the brilliant, glistening white mountains we are treated to demonstrating why these films have contributed almost as much to the tourist dollars flooding into New Zealand as into AOL/Time Warner's coffers, they being the owners of New Line.We are treated to a greater understanding of the closeness between the Ring Bearer and his ever stalwart Gardener, which is a blessing and goes a long way to backing up the inkling we get of their friendship and mutual respect at the end of the previous installment. Alas though the comic relief is stripped for the most part from the characters of Merry and Pippin and bestowed instead upon Gimli and Legolas, but the good natured ribbing is preferable over the constant grousing, complaint and general mumbling that pass for Gimli's lines in most of the first half of the film.There is a disjointedness in Jackson's employment of `Dream Sequences' which cause a general disorientation and I felt detracted from my ability to see where the story was going and what was actually happening. Was Arwen really leaving with her father, or was this some possible future.and how did it fit into the story or move the tale along? Not since Kubrick's `The Shining', when I saw the person in the Bear costume, was I left as perplexed as to what the director was trying to say, but then it came to me later as I saw how Jackson was treating the lovely Miranda Otto's character Eowen's adoration of Aragorn. (An adoration which has little or no merit however due to the omission of several events from the book.)As in watching a Puppet Show, Gollum slowly became more real to me because of my desire to believe he was a person and not merely a computer generated character. The interaction between he and the Hobbits is done quite well and is believable in the end, due in no small part to the talents of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.This lushly photographed epic is spectacular on the eyes, and many of the performances deserve a great deal of praise, but at three hours it gets tremendously bogged down in the great battle the film leads up to, it offering nothing unique from moment to moment outside of the occasional stunt or special effect. Lots of fighting, lots of things getting their heads, arms and other things cut off or impaled. In the end I give it, as a movie on its own merits, 3 out of 5 stars for being confusing in its dream sequences and long and boring in its battles. (Something I've been known to say about Kurasawa's `Ran' as well.)Many of the fans of Tolkien's masterwork have decried the changes made in the story between the book and the film. They ask why these changes needed to be made and what possessed Peter Jackson to make them.The question they all really need to ask is why things were left out like The Paths of the Dead, Gandalf and Co. going to Orthanc to confront Saruman and the ending with Shelob. The answer you will inevitably get is that there wasn't enough time in the three hour time slot, but then the follow up question is "Then why did you add so much crap that had nothing to do with the story, like the cheesy dream sequences which were only there to encourage the audience to believe that there was a chance for a romance between Aragorn and Eowen, or Aragorn's near death experience...or Frodo revealing himself and the Ring to the Nazgul in Osgiliath, a place that Faramir would have as soon taken the Hobbits to as he would "...take this thing, if it lay by the highway...", something which the film infers quite the opposite sentiment of in the character's actions...Truth to be told Mr. Jackson has, in his career, shown himself to be a master of action and gore. These are things which, in this film, were portrayed quite extensively at Helm's Deep...very extensively...in the extreme and to the detriment of the film, for the very length of the battle, the 4 months to film it and the incredible resources required to make what was shown could have been better spent actually telling the story instead of producing the only battle scene that I have personally ever struggled to stay awake through. I guess though that you cannot blame the man for sticking to that which he knows best...after all he DID win an award once for using the most fake blood in a movie scene in the film "Brain Dead". (A dubious award at best though for anyone who saw the theatrical rendition of Stephen King's "The Shining"...but I digress...)Thankfully they cut Arwen out of Helm's Deep, but where in the world did they come up with the "Genesis Cave" for the Women and Children to hide in instead of going to Harrowdale? Was it that much more important for the understanding by the audience of the story to show Osgiliath instead of the stately valley of Rohan in which the muster of Rohirrim kept safe?And what of the curious decision to banish Eomer? They had to create an entire scene for this travesty for the sole purpose of the simpleminded conversation between Rohirrum and the three travelers so that they could heighten fears of Merry and Pippin's demise! Oh what tangled webs we weave, indeed!!It seems that Mr. Jackson, et al, have such a low opinion of the viewing audience that he thinks it is necessary to beat them over the head with the most obvious of cheap story telling tricks in order to make them understand that which Tolkien had no problem conveying with no devaluation of the Characters or Story. While he altered events and dialog apparently to make the concepts more accessible to those who have not read the books, he presumes that the audience will accept the quite obscure concept of the Elves `.going over the sea.' at face value, making no attempt to explain what this means or indeed where they are going and why. This is confusing to me because of all the things he glazed over this is potentially the most confusing, yet it remained free of the `dumbing down' that so many other things suffered throughout the motion picture.In fact if you look at the thing as a whole it becomes immediately apparent that one thing led to another in the writing of this screenplay. Every little change made, ostensibly for the sake of making the story understandable to the audience which hasn't read the books, led to one, two or more changes in the story having to be made to compensate for the lack of logic or continuity caused...It seems that when Mr. Jackson states that he is making these films in "the spirit" of Tolkien he means that it has Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits and not much else in the way of the story, which leads me to wonder why he didn't just write his own fantasy story to film? Because he was nobody in the industry and needed the "big name" to push the deal. Nobody would buy an epic fantasy story by a man who's previous credits had been cheap but enjoyable horror movies and torrid black comedy, but with Tolkien's name on the project it would fly. Alas the Name is the most that has remained, and even IT was forced to be removed from the title by the estate...and here, in this film, we see more examples of how Peter Jackson is creating personal wealth on the skeletal remains of the most beloved story of the past millennium with little regard for the integrity, logic or continuity which made the original story feel more like a historical epic then a mythology for England, while all the while claiming that he wanted the movies to feel like Historical works rather then Fantasy.New Zealand should produce a coin in honor of their Cinematic Son, Peter Jackson, and it should have a face on each side...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. However, I feel the comic relief in this film was in bad taste. During, the epic Helms battle sequence the joking between Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas is totally uncalled for and took away from the drama of the moment. The tree special effects were not very good at all, but in contrast the Smigel CGI was astounding. I felt Samwise Gamgee was a little too smart in this film in comparison to where he was when Fellowship left off. Overall, I gave this movie a seven. I highly recommend seeing this film, but don't expect too much. Peter Jackson appeared to think that it would be too much drama for viewers to handle so he softened it up. Not sure if Tolkien would be as pleased with this one as with Fellowship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There I was sitting on third row, 0:30 in the morning (or night) ready for the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (that can hardly be considered a trilogy), 'The Two Towers'. Like last year's premiere this was one that made excitement and amazement win from exhaustion. This one is even one minute longer than 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and for you people out there who wonder if it leaves you waiting in anticipation for part three, 'The Return of the King' like last year's movie did: yes.. even more. Now I want to see how it ends.One difference for me personally was the fact I started reading the novel in the meantime. And that made me realize there were quite some differences, both improvements as well as some quite disappoinments. Maybe the word 'disappointment' is not chosen properly since this is and always will be an adaptation for the big screen and a movie requires other things than a book does... Problem with having read 'The Two Towers' just before the movie is released is that you start to recognize things immediately. People who have read it several times will probably go through the same thing. But this wasn't of a disturbing kind.Director Peter Jackson did not follow Tolkien blindly. He took some artistic freedoms, including a bunch of extra scenes, and he twisted around the chapters quite a bit. And that automatically provides the best improvement on the novel. My problems while reading 'The Two Towers' is that its first half (the 3rd book of the series) completely focuses on Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli and the second half (the 4th book) only on Sam, Frodo and Gollum. While reading the one half you wonder how the other characters are doing. Jackson suitably switches between these 3 seperate storylines which makes the movie much more enjoyable. Some scenechanges were a bit too swift but Jackon does a good job trying to keep the viewer's interest. Added to this are several other character/scene-changes, like the ones showing Saruman, King Théoden and his daughter Eowyn and the Elves Elrond and Arwen.Now there's an example of elements Jackson added to the story that aren't in the original: the Elves. To my opinion it was a bit unnescessary but not bugging. And the proclaimed lovestory was there but not dominating, just like it wasn't in 'The Fellowship'.Gollum is amazing, exceeding the CGI-characters you've seen in other movies (like Yoda in 'Attack of the Clones' and Dobby in 'The Chamber of Secrets') in personality and looks. Sometimes his movements are a bit harsh and too much PC, but this actually is a character with personality where a lot of his CGI-counterparts completely lack such a thing. His internal battle is very well being presented, showing he actually has two sides, Gollum and Sméagol, something Tolkien very well depicted already. This shows Peter Jackson actually admires the author and wants to keep his intentions stored.Treebeard is a bit disappointing in a way that he's less interesting compared to Gollum. and you very well see the fact Jackson used both CGI animation as well as lifesize dummies. Maybe the Ents are the reason why a lot of people proclaimed 'The Lord of the Rings' was unfilmable. Maybe their concept doesn't allow any cinematographical treatment. Still the scene in which they literally wash Saruman's ears is still rather amazing.And Helm's Deep isn't? Yes, Helm's Deep certainly is. If you keep in mind that most sets were real-life and it took 3 months of nightly filming in the rain this definately is one of the most smashing scenes in movie-history. The giant armies of Saruman's Uruk-Hai's almost faint you. A few minutes before that you see them leave Isengard and I couldn't help making comparison with Hitler's stadium army gatherings in the late 1930's. Helm's Deep marks the fact that most action is put in the last quarter of the movie. The only complaint about the Helm's Deep sequences is the fact it sometimes is abruptly disturbed by the other storylines. Maybe I was expecting half an hour of pure fighting and battling but Jackson switches to other character's and their battles in the meantime (like the Ents attack on Isengard and Frodo and Sam's capture and battle in Osgiliath (also not a novel element with an amazing 'new' scene with the flying Nazg?l).All in all: even better than 'The Fellowship', very well character development, a lot of action but exchanged with a lot of story and... why do years take 365 days?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of the year! Pass this over Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed to see LOTR: The Fellowship fall to A Beautiful Mind for Oscar last year and Peter Jackson not winning best director certainly irked me.This year should be a different story. This is one of the best movies, if not best sequels of all time. I don't want to give away any spoilers but all the CG characters including Gollum, Treebeard and the Nazgul looked incredible. I plan on seeing it again and again. That was the fastest 3 hours of my life. So all you haters out there just stop and enjoy a great movie and a release from reality. Thank God for Tolkien and Peter Jackson. This is all I needed for Christmas this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing sequel to Fellowship of the Ring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations for this film were fairly high after seeing FOTR and I was not disappointed. For all it's differences from the books, this trilogy is a one-of-a-kind and an absolutely brilliant body of work. For the cast and crew who brought the story to life, I want to pass on my very humble gratitude. You ROCK!I am especially impressed with Howard Shore's haunting and tragic score, which brought tears to my eyes more than once. Bless you! I am also awed by the portrayals of every single cast member. I feel that the casting was so well done that in many ways, even though my mental characterizations were different for some of the roles (specifically Frodo), I now have adapted my thinking to accomodate the change and I love it!I also have to put in a plug for the most AMAZING Elf Lord ever created, both in writing and on screen. Orlando Bloom IS Legolas Greenleaf. He has given substance to my favorite character in ways that I'd never imagined an actor doing.Orlando, a'mael Legolas, thank you! You're incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR was amazing but this is even BETTER!!! Best movie(series) ever!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it doesnt live up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things!

As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well.

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it doesnt live up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR was amazing but this is even BETTER!!! Best movie(series) ever!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it doesnt live up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR was amazing but this is even BETTER!!! Best movie(series) ever!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)OK this move was better then what i thought. The opening scene with Gandalf was alone the best ive ever seen! And Helms deep...speechless!! I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum.

		<shortDescription>AMAZING!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely amazing to watch, truly amazing.I've read where some people are utterly disgusted with the direction this movie is taking, that makes me upset. This movie was so much better than the first. Granted that some parts which were included never happened in the book, while some of the semi important parts weren't included at all. But come on it's a movie after all. It's made for as much entertainment one could cram within a certain amount of time. If the makers of this movie were to do every single thing in the book it would be a 10 hour movie. I think what they did with this movie worked very well. People should go to see a movie for the fun of it, not to be so petty as to criticize every little detail of the movie.Everything about this movie was top notch, from the actors to the cgi animation. I can't wait to see this movie again and catch some of the things I missed the first time. It's definitely worth your time and money. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I don't care whether your a big time fan of the books or not, there is something in this movie which will please everyone.I give this movie a 9, only because the beginning of the movie was a tad slow, but they had to do that to help develop the story plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it doesnt live up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the first movie, but still OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absoulutly Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

They did an excellent job portraying some of the characters (especially Gollum) and getting the real mood, theme, and just general sense of each scene. The settings where provided with incredible and beautiful detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Two Towers" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways. The film begins with a powerfully audacious image: Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, "You shall not pass!" As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you. Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in "The Two Towers", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination: the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments. We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level. This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time. Only 364 days until the final chapter, "The Return of the King", hits theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it doesnt live up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however. I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition. More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman. This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. He is also a much stronger king in the books.Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring. As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was "weaker" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up. He is noble and wise. He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers. It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things! Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely. His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though. What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My gosh from the moment that i entered the theater to see The Two towers i knew that i was instore for a great treat. I set my expectations pretty high, reading all the great reviews for the movie and was hoping that it wouldnt go below my expectations and i was right. This movie was amazing and no one can say it wasnt. I wont release any spoilers because everyone has to see it for themselves. If your a person who likes constant action, laughs here and there, and a great mythical plot than see this. The difference from the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two towers is that the two towers is actually better. More action, and everything just seems to come together and it ends in a spot where were dying for more and just knowing that the Return of the King will be even more amazing. But anyway go see this and be amazed to have seen the best picture of the year!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on. The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. "sentimental moments" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimentalmusic and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. "Dwarf humor". OK, the dwarf is small and funny. You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again. The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum. OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other. You show it once, you show it twice, ... He is not the main figure in the story.So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches. But there is good animation, special effects. The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ. The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely Astounding!First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackson continues to channell Tolkien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers: It's official, Lucas is the padawan of film makers, Peter Jackson is the master.New Line Cinema will go down in the annals as having made a brilliant decision at a time in it's history where a gaffe could have sunken them, and we as filmgoers should be amply grateful that things fell into place the way that they have(these people that gave Jackson LotR also gave Raimi Spiderman - I think I see a trend). Now, granted, Jackson was handed one of the greatest stories ever told to bring to cinematic life, which Lucas was not, but Lucas could certainly follow some leads here on returning some humanity, lightness, and real dimensions into his upcoming swan song; after all, turnabout is fair play - Lucasfilm gave WETA their first leg up on a lot of the CGI technology prior to the Fellowship. But full marks to New Line for making some uncharacteristically shrewd moves at the studio level which are going to continue to pay large dividends over the remainder of the decade. THus far, Lord of the Rings has been all that Episodes I and II have promised to be without any of the sloppy shortcuts.A steady barrage of well plotted action, more polished performances by a cast little in need of polish in the first film, fanatic dedication to the material by all involved, and the discerning hand of Peter Jackson and his staff bringing it all together adds up to one of those rare sequels that at least matches the original, but in some ways surpasses it.Some have been mistakenly critical, but count me amongst those in the majority that found the way this movies hit the ground running to be a major positive. The backstory well established for all but the foolish holdouts, Jackson sees no need to build his story up, and launches right into chapter 2 of the saga with vigor. Opening with a teaser of the unseen footage of the Balrog battle from Fellowship, eyes are popped early on and make their way back into the sockets only during brief respites where the story is glued together. Really refreshing to see an epic like this done so painstakingly and with such dedication to craftsmanship without sacrificing an iota of story advancement.My biggest fear before his first scene(wasn't kept waiting long) was that Gollum wouldn't work - CGI simply hasn't been 100% successful imo with central characters to date, but you can chalk up another breakthrough for Jackson. His wise decision in hiring Andy Serkis to not only voice the character and map out his motions, but to also perform his scenes live during filming payed off handsomely. Nothing short of groundbreaking the way Gollum fits into the movie so seamlessly.And WETA did not lose a step either going into this second movie. The many otherworldly denizens of middle earth are brought convincingly to life on grand scales(of number and size), the locales of Barad Dur, Helmsdeep, Rohan, and Isengard are completely mesmerizing, and the battle choreographies and sequences of mass destruction are again new standard bearers for the industry.In short, a great movie on all fronts - if you don't like this movie, I hereby request you put me on ignore; we have nothing more to discuss, though I'd be interested to hear any cowardly swedes' opinions on the film before doing so.4/4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can say without any morale reprehension to rush out and see The Two Towers. While comparing it to Fellowship would be nearly impossible. The way I see it these films are two different types, while Fellowship was character development with enough action to keep you excited, Towers is action with enough character development to keep you caring. It's hard to say which is better because I feel that I have reached the middle part of one fantastic nine hour epic film, and you don't find people saying what third of a movie they liked best. The acting in Two Towers is top notch, as it was to be expected. But the true stand out wasn't who you would have expected, it was Gollum. If ever a CGI character deserved an Academy award or at least a nomination, it is Gollum. The CGI is so beleivable its creepy and the acting really lets you see whats going on inside of his head. This was a difficult job you could tell but Serkis pulled it off with style. The action will keep you begging for more as Jackson never ceases to amaze you with what he can do with the camera. So go now, stop reading and then wait a year until you can watch the extended edition in preparation for Return of the King</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, absolutely fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers". Needless to say I was pretty excited because for as long as I can remember I've been a great admirer of Tolkien and huge fan of the first Lord of the Rings film. I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. The story line picks up where Jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (I'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.)Merry and Pippin have managed to escape from the Orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: Ents, trees that can move and speak. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to rescue Merry and Pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, Gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. After being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of Rohan where Saruman holds the King in an evil spell. After freeing the king they must prepare for Saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. The Battle of Helm's Deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (Peter Jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.)Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mordor but find themselves lost. After an encounter with the creature Gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, Frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let Gollum guide them. Gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called Smeagol. In the movie 'The Two Towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within Gollum. Smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and Gollum the bad. These scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level. And of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal Arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved Aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of King Theoden, the strong and noble Eomer who will do anything for Rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister Eowyn who develops feelings for Aragorn; and lastly Faramir, the brother of the late Boromir, now Captain to Gondor.This movie didn't feel like a movie. I honestly felt as though I had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. It was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'The Two Towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. It is perfectly carried through. There was not a moment I didn't savour - I didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance I get. If anything, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. And although I understand this movie isn't for everyone, I still highly recommend it to all. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[This review is spoiler-free]The people who are going to appreciate this film the most are people who have read the books, but only once or twice, and not very recently.The film is visually stunning, although a bit chaotic sometimes... sensory overload, anyone? But that can't help the fact that this movie, unlike it's predecessor, has several problems.1) The plot is split, trying to focus on three, sometimes four, different but interwoven plot lines. IF you have read the book, there is no effort to keep concentrated. However, if you haven't read the book it might become very confusing.2) On the other hand, if you are very familiar with the book, you will be a bit disappointed by the story treatment. Sure, most of the things from the book are in the film, but not necessarily in the same order, or even with the same characters, as in the book. As book adaptions go, this one strays frequently off the path quite a bit. To make matters worse, the changes in the storyline have no apparent benefits or reasons; they just exist. I mean, we all understood why Tom Bombadill had to go from the first movie, no matter how much we hate it. Not so with this film.3) The characters, with a couple of brilliant exceptions, behave rather odd. Merry and Pippin suddenly mature while Gimli is reduced to an axe-weilding homicidal comic relief and Legolas seems to be very dim-witted in this movie.4) Although visually stunning, the battle is just too unrealistic. Wait, you say, this is a fantasy movie. True, but that doesn't mean you just can abandon the laws of nature... since this review is spoiler free I won't go into any details, but you can only let a character miraculously survive the onslaught of a gazillion enemies so many times before it get's ridiculous.So, to sum it up; most of the audience will probably like it, since it had great effects, lots of action and Liv Tyler in a skimpy dress. Fans of the book would do well to leave their brains at the door though. It all boils down to how high expectations you have, and how much you love the book. Ironically, the computer generated characters of Gollum and Treebeard are the best parts...</fullReview>

This was free, so I can't say I got my money's worth. Instead, I was repaid GRACIOUSLY for trekking down to the theater. (A harrowing experience in the snow.)Anyway, I want to keep this brief. I have to give props to the animation department for their very accurate emulation of human movement on Gollum. He interacts with the characters and environment so fluidly, so amazingly, I forgot instantly that he was digital at all. Gollum's movements are scary and unnerving... and scarily accurate to the book's telling of Gollum's conduct. You think the environments in FOTR were good? Put it aside. Helm's Deep is ridiculously beautiful. As an artist, I've come to appreciate environment, but the scenery on and around Helm's Deep are so stunning it took me forever to soak it all in. I woke up the next morning and I was still commenting to myself on the power of this scenery. Talk about epic. This movie outdoes itself. If you had any quavering doubts about the direction of the series after watching FOTR, give TT a chance... the sheer power of this movie is overwhelming.Legolas fans get more insane stunts, and Gimli fans get the best lines in the movie. See TT or I'll beat you with a stick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but really hard to follow for those who didn't read the book (like me). But i liked the special effects, the battle of helmsdeep was awesome (albeit a little too unrealistic). its a pitty that they left a lot of things unexplained (the whole story about the Ents was left out, according to my friend who read the book), but this would make the movie even longer.i'll give it 7 out of 10p.s.

		<shortDescription>What's with the Osgiliath-plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I have to admit that mr Jackson went and did it again. As a film it's terrific. As an interpretation of the books - quite ok. But, being a huge fan of the book, I can't say I'm totally comfortable with the fact that large chunks of storyline was omitted, and other parts inserted at what seemed random.The ents were portrayed very close to what I had in mind myself, but the conclusion to go to war should've been reached at the summit, like in the book. A plus though for Treebeard - very cool character. :)Osgiliath. What was wrong with just keeping the company east of Anduin, at the Forbidden Pool-site? And why was Sean Bean not casted to play Faramir too? And, most importantly, why was Faramir so "evil"? He should've been portrayed as in the book - a crystal clear counterweight to his brother. But oh no, Peter Jackson had to go ahead and make him semi-evil and let him drag the poor hobbits of to Osgiliath. There - after a short intermezzo between Frodo and a Nazg?l - Faramir somehow - in a very hippie-like way - changes his opinion, and sends the party of with his most sincere wishes for good luck, etc."If you let them go, the blah blah of the blah of Gondor states that your life will be forfeit!" "Then let it be forfeit" - no explanation given to this. Bad.Argh!Gollum was - in lack for better words - perfect. The fact that it was CGI alltogether never shone through. Great work! I especially like the dialogue he has with himself about whether to trust his Master or not.Elronds little tantrum after Arwen refuses to leave Middle Earth is also a little strange. As is the fact that Galadriel - via some strange form of telepathy? - gets Elrond to send reinforcements to Helms deep. (My impression after reading the books is that Elrond (half-elf) is more positive to humans and other races than Galadriel. In the films he seems to be more reserved?)Oh, let's face it - I dislike Liv Tyler.I liked the movie though. Very much so. I think I gave FoTR 8/10 or so, so I have to give this one 9/10. It's improving, mister Jackson! :)For those who haven't seen it already, do it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw TTT at the world premiere on December 5, and I'm STILL excited. If they had strung the film up again after the end credits played, I would have watched it straight through again. I would have watched another hour of story if it had been offered. It was just shy of 3 hours long and it never felt too long. I've gone so far as to purchase the extended version of FotR so I can memorize it since I can't get my TTT fix until the end of this week.It is fantastic. The film escalates in action, tension, and dread, and rightly so considering it's place in the novel.Several details are changed in order to compress the events of the book into the film. Several events and details are also changed or added to develop character. There are no gratuitous changes in this film. Even if I don't necessarily agree with the need for such and such changes, I have to admit that they add depth to the FILM version of the story, especially for persons unfamiliar with the novel. Characters that are a little flat and predictable in the novel are given more psychological texture and motivation. Good guys who are 'too' good in the book are a little uneven in the film; they take some time to work out their issues instead of instantly being perfect. This was done in FotR as well in the characterization of Aragorn, and it continues in TTT with more of the characters.Do not expect this film to mirror the book precisely. If you had a moment of shock and horror when Glorfindel was reinterpreted into Arwen, you will have similar moments with TTT. But, trust me and just go with them. So much happens in every scene that you'll miss something if you stop to think about divergences. I can't wait for the extended version of this one, as certain underdeveloped details will undoubtedly be cleared up in a *gasp* longer version.And, of course, it is gorgeous to look at.And here is one massive (sort of) SPOILER for fans of the book.If you have read the books and know where TTT ends, the film doesn't end in the same place. It ends earlier, and we don't get to Shelob. She is only hinted at. Of course, if they had put her in, the film would have been an hour longer....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As difficult a feat as that might seem, Jackson delivers an even better film than The Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers is the grandest spectacle that has ever graced the screen. As near-perfect as a film can possibly get, no longer comparable to other genre pictures, but to the great classics of the art.The sheer scope of The Two Towers makes its predecessor look like an idle stroll in the park. It starts with a bang and doesn't quit for the whole three hours of its duration. And like in the first part, Jackson doesn't fall victim to all the eye candy (and there's more than plenty), he injects the endeavour with a sense of humanity and gravitas that transcends fantasy film-making. Perhaps the greatest surprise is Gollum, a CGI creation that is guaranteed to make your jaw drop. Acted by Andy Serkis and replaced in the final version by a marvelous computer creation by Wetta Digital (surpassing all previous digital characters by miles), he delivers the best performance in the movie. Dynamic, incredibly expressive and ultimately conveying a sense of real pity for the character. And that's no small achievement in a film filled with actors of this calibre. It all concludes with what is probably the best medieval battle scene ever shown and will leave you with a hunger for more.The Two Towers is what film's all about. A true masterpiece. And we still have one more film before the trilogy is completed.</fullReview>

I was never a big fan of the books, but I would say that "The Two Towers" was in every way a better film than "The Fellowship of the Ring". When the battle of Helm's Deep began, I was certain that the film would end there; and that we would end up with a "cliff-hanger" ending, and a film that was only a come-on for the next installment. But "The Two Towers" was, on its own, complete and satisfying. The Battle of Helm's Deep was an astonishing cinematic achievement all by itself; and that is only 1/3 of the movie. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one. If you loved the first one, get some friends to go with you so they can carry you out of the theater. You'll have the time of your life.

		<shortDescription>One ring still rules them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing LOTR The Two Towers I only regret that it takes another year to see the final ending of this epic saga. Of course, having read the book several times, I know how it will end, but I'm very curious how Peter Jackson will adapt it to the screen. Judging by this second installment I imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. Watching TTT was an amazing experience with many highlights. First of all there is of course the creature Gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. Other highlights include the battle at Helms Deep as well as the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog. For the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from Gimli. There are however also some parts that worked less for me. Personally I was not fond of the side-plot with Treebeard in the book and I don't care for it much in the movie. However, it is essential to the story, so who am I to complain. What I also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of Elves?All these little things aside, Peter Jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against Mordor and survival of Mankind and Middle Earth. Jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. Rightfully so, I would say, because if you have not seen The Fellowship there is no real point in watching The Two Towers. There is some reference to some loose ends The Fellowship left (what happened to Gandalf, who is Gollum etc), but never too much. Anybody who enjoyed the Fellowship will also enjoy The Two Towers. The movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. And that is good news. I wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. Therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... Bring on 'Return of the King'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't wait for the extended version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked or loved Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (hereafter: FOTR) you'll most likely be very satisfied with The Two Towers (hereafter: TTT). I was able to catch an advanced screening and I must say that I was quite impressed with the second installment of this trilogy. I must confess that while I've read the books (once in elementary school and again about a year ago), I'm not a devote to the written version. The tone and pacing of TTT is much different than that of FOTR, it's faster, darker, and a bit more confusing. Now by confusing, it's not as if you ever lose track of what's going on, but rather, since it is told by inter-cutting the 3 main story lines it's harder to relate the story lines to one another than I remember it being in the book. It helps keep the momentum of the movie moving along, but I felt as if it hindered the momentum of the individual storylines. Mostlikely a catch-22, so I suppose there's no getting around it.The movie does not stand alone, if you're going to see it, but haven't seen the 1st one or read the books, do yourself a favor and spend the $4 to rent the movie or $7 to buy the book. Without this prior info you'll struggle to figure out who these people are and/or what their motivations are.Ok, to the stuff you want to know. The battle at Helms Deep is massive and amazing. Gollum is everything you could hope to get from a CGI character and more, not perfect, but probably as perfect as can be at this point. The Ents, to me at least were a bit disappointing, both in their rendering on screen and how their story was developed. If anything is slighted in the movie it's the development of the Ent characters.Bottom line, a very good movie, probably in line with FOTR (although having just seen the extended version, which I see as a significant improvement of FOTR, I might be overvaluing it somewhat). TTT will also, no doubt, benefit greatly from an extended treatment. The doom and danger in TTT is palpable and the movie rarely disappoints. I'm sure that repeated viewings will only serve to improve the movie, as it is a lot of visual and informational material to ingest in one sitting. I'd rate it at 8.5 (I'd rate FOTR a 9.0 and FOTR extended version a 9.5 or higher), but again with another viewing or two, I'd probably like the movie even more. Go see it now, er...as soon as you can, despite my soft-selling it, you won't be disappointed! After all, if I can enjoy it sitting in a cramped screening room with a head and chest cold and little sleep, I can only imagine that in a real theater in good health you'll enjoy it that much more. I don't want to add to the hype, but this is a damn nice movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what can I say ... I am still speechless and awed from such a breathtaking film. Let me start off by saying that I believe Two Towers was a difficult book to adapt because of the break of the fellowship. The jump from Frodo to Sam, to the three hunters and Gandalf, to Merry and Pippin, as well as the introduction to many other characters made the flow of the film very unorthodox. We are so used to seeing film's introduce the plot and characters, show how characters grow, see them run into conflict and see how it all ends ... and so even when I knew that Two Towers could not flow in that manner, it still took me some time getting used to the hopping around. At first, it made me feel quite uncomfortable, but now I have a growing appreciation for Peter Jackson's choice of storytelling. I hope those who watch it can keep that in consideration; though I fear that critics will not keep that in mind when they see the film.I am most impressed with the Battle at Helm's Deep. It was absolutely stunning, and one of the best battle sequences I have ever seen on film. Everything from the incredible CGI, the amazing choreographed action sequences, the costumes and settings (working under the rain sequence must have been treacherous), to Gimli's innocent comic relief, was so wonderfully done. For every second of the 45 minute scene I was at the edge of my seat, with my hands clenched and my eyes widened, hoping and rooting for the victory of the men and elves, even when I knew how it would end.Next, I would like to say that Andy Serkis was magnificent. Not only did he capture the movement of Gollum, but he also mastered Gollum's voice and his multi-personality disorder.In fact, all the actors did a exceptional job. The audience was able to see the characters changing, growing and slowly developing into what they are fated to be in the end. Elijah Wood was especially marvelous.Overall, Two Towers was remarkable and a wonderful second addition to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Can't wait to see what ROTK is going to be like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I attended a Press-Screening here in Zurich and saw what I have been waiting for almost a year.It started very good with the fight between Gandalf and the Fire-Beast (I must say I did NOT read the books, but I gave The Fellowship of the Ring 10/10 and liked the whole idea a lot, but I do not know all the characters by name....there are more important things in life). But after an hour I was getting bored a bit, after two hours I was asking myself where is "a LOT more action than in the first one" as seemingly everybody is talking about??? I still think it is a good film, but it was by far not what I expected after the excellent first part.CGI-Gollum is terrific and beats every cgi-character with dialogue we have seen before. End battle was good but not great (it always reminded me of the fortress attack in Starship Troopers but with orcs). The nasguls are just there but not frightening as they were in the first part. Gandalf has only a small part. Saruman as well. The tree-guys...well they were cool in the end-battle.Sorry to say that I am disappointed. I will see it again, maybe it helps (I want to like it). If you haven't seen the first one don't bother, you will probably not get it.Because of the production value and tech aspects I still give it a 7/10.PS: I think it will open very big, but it will not be as successful as the first. I guess 600 to 700 million worldwide (which still would be very good)</fullReview>

While riffing on Tolkien's basic themes (evil is bad; benevolence is good), it throws us into wild orc fracases (or would that be fricassees?), gruelling identity-quests (both Frodo and the brilliantly-animated Gollum go quite ringy-dingy) and seemingly endless money-shots for the New Zealand Tourism Bureau. While there are occasional lapses of logic for the characters (Aragorn: "Oh, let's just let that evil Wormtongue escape so he can assist the significantly more evil Saruman in attacking us!") and the writers ("Oh, let's just end the movie on a relatively dull note!"), the overall aura is magical and mysterious. Not nearly enough Christopher Lee here, and the Elvish Overdubbing -- though beautiful -- is sandwiched in pretty awkwardly, but the "peripheral hobbits" are all terrific, the Elf and the Dwarf arouse and amuse appropriately, and Théoden's niece and those wonderful Ents are welcome in my garden absolutely</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" at a preview screening, and it was every bit as good as I expected it to be. The technical elements are cutting edge, and as in "The Fellowship of the Ring," perfect examples of special effects expertly used in the service of the story. This film will leave you breathless in places, awestruck and bowled-over with the fast-paced action and excitement."The Two Towers" is certainly darker and grittier than the first film-- as it should be.Obviously, the question with this new Peter Jackson film, as with the last, is: Is it true to the book? Yes, it captures the spirit of Tolkien's writing, and in many places surpasses the dramatic tension of the books. Does it stray from Tolkien's plot: Yes, to a degree. To those that love the books, the differences will be obvious-- and maybe a little jarring-- but once you weigh the changes against the dramatic &amp; visual impact the changes make, you reach the conclusion that these were the right choices for the movie. After all, this is the movie, not the book. Don't go expecting to "see the book," with every little plot detail and line of dialogue on the screen verbatim. It doesn't work that way. What Jackson has again given us is his visual interpretation of the spirit of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and the results are grand, epic, stunning, literate, surprising, vivid and unforgettable. A vastly entertaining film. Sadly, we now just have to wait another year to see the end of the story-- but that film, like this one, will surely be worth the wait.</fullReview>

This is by far the best film of 2002, and as terrific as The Fellowship of the Ring was, The Two Towers tops it by a long shot!This film, as everyone knows, is the middle chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. It has no beginning story, and no end story, but is simply the middle chapter, and like most middle chapters, it's darker, a LOT darker than the first film with a lot more action and detail. (Gimli, in my opinion, steals the show with his humor!) If you are waiting for a long exposition like at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring, it comes half way through!The special effects, well, let's just say that Gollum is the best looking CGI character to ever hit the big screen and wait until you see Treebeard and the Ents!The battle of Helm's Deep, involving thousands of Uru-Kai warriors, is one of the most amazing action sequences ever to be put on film!This film, like the last one, ends on a cliffhanger with all of the characters facing new dangers. And I won't spoil any of it for those looking forward to it!It looks like once again, Peter Jackson is indeed the Kiwi George Lucas!!Great action, cinematography, acting, and direction make this by far the BEST film of 2002!The Two Towers is quite possibly one of the best sequels to ever hit cinemas!Harry Potter, eat your heart out, The Two Towers will show the world, once again, who is the top fantasy film series!!!If an 10+ rating were possible I would definitely give The Two Towers one!!!!!!!!!!Expect, once again, massive box office returns , and several Oscar nominations next year for The Two Towers!PRE-ORDER YOUR TICKETS FOR THE TWO TOWERS NOW, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!A 10 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo &amp; Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of "The Lord of the Rings" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than "fellowship of the ring" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film did not loose any steam... instead it keeps building. No matter how many times I see these movies I still get the same thrills that I did at first viewing.This film is a bit dirtier, grittier than the first film... due to the war torn areas and great battles involved. CGI used for a lot of these scenes but not misused.. which is nice. I'm kinda picky about CGI and Peter Jackson's films are always done in good taste - never abused.Like the first film, the 2nd film leaves you craving more - which we get in the 3rd in the series "Return of the King". I can say that for movies that are around 3 hours in length - the films seems short to me... the time goes by so quickly when watching.Another film I would highly recommend for fans of High Fantasy.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some see it as the lesser entry of the trilogy. I see it as the vital bridge which allows the characters to develop. Samwise and Frodo spend more time with each other. Gollum gets significant character development as his dual personality leaves the two main characters split on whether he is helping them or not, weakening their loyalty to each other.Merry and Pippin, with the help of Treebeard, get to where they need to go in a subplot that adds humor and character to an otherwise rough movie. Saruman and the surviving Gandalf are also in conflict. And there's plenty of meaty battles. The Two Towers combines immersive setting, intense action and strong storytelling together in an overall essential experience for fans of fantasy..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong second act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of "Heavenly Creatures" and "Dead Alive" did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's "By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a "10"). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not about 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow what a flick, totally was not expecting this. Hobbits? Elves? Giant eye towers? What even the heck!!1??? I rented this from my local video store ("Local Video Store" in Newark) expecting to see an insightful retelling of the 9/11 events. No dice. What I got was a grade-A spectacle to the senses directed by skeeter Jackson. Not sure what this film was based on and there might have been another movie before it, but I did pick up on a couple of allusions to the Warren Commission's report. This was literally enthralling as I feel that the Warren Commission never got much recognition and wouldn't expect it to have influenced a film in the mythical realm. Trill, nonetheless.At one point a couple of the hobbit guys and a bunch of talking trees come up to a large, steel tower and aren't sure how to topple it. Fuel and airborne aluminum projectiles are not a feasible option because this is like mid-evil times, but that couldn't have possibly brought it down anyhow. Instead they throw some rocks an stuff at it, but can't knock it down. They settle for breaking a dam instead and it's kinda rad. Then there's the other crew which is a man and some minorities and they are chasing after other hobbits who are carrying a weapon that is capable of mass destruction. This is their excuse for pursing said hobbits and not helping with the tower. I guess I should mention that there is a whole lot going on at one time. The good guys that we are following have had a beef with the bad guys (orcs, some snitch wizard, and a giant eye that's on fire) for a long time and want their land a resources as their own. I don't want to spoil too much so I'll stop there, but wow! what a movie. I really like it, 10 stars all the way. Watch it if you can. Hell stop by my place if you're in Newark and give it a view with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers is that rare type of movie: a sequel that is better than the original.With the fellowship in splinters, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, and we all mourn Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is even greater than its predecessor and successor. Every shot is impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, my precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Does Not Improve With Each Sequel, The Second One Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.On the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sméagol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor. Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The stories that stay with you"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty "wow" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough ? or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The middle one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers - Saturday Night Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson delivers again. In style.The Lord of the Rings : The Towers, is the next installment, or rather the continuation of the Fellowship of The Ring. The story continues from the Great River, where Frodo and Sam part away from the rest of the Fellowship and embark on a journey never to be forgotten: that of destroying the One Ring, by taking it deep inside Mordor, into Mount Doom.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin once again steal the show with supreme performances of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee respectively, while the return of Gandalf is welcomed appreciatively. The story takes on two difference courses, both of which are equally vital and are given almost the equal amount of time throughout the movie.Peter Jackson has not disappointed one bit with the visuals. The screenplay is simply magnificent and war sequence of Helms Deep will always be one of my favorite scenes in the Lord of The Rings. Faith, trust, loyalty and friendship is shown throughout the movie, as in the epic book of J.R.R. Tolkein. The music is wonderful, quite similar to its previous installment, but nevertheless a hundred percent effective. The fall of Isengard is shown in a splendid way and Jackson shows it takes more than mere directing to achieve it. A great effort taken by the entire crew for the movie and full appreciation deserved.Quite a few would be of the opinion that The Two Towers is relatively disappointing with respect to the other two movies. I beg to disagree. The movie has been fantastically captured, and pays tribute to the book perfectly.Overall, it is a captivating movie, taking the story to its final part, the epic ending of the Lord of the Rings. A must watch for any movie fan, let alone an The Lord of the Rings fanatic. It is a visual treat, great story telling and great performances. A 10 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Number One Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the films I've seen during my life, which is easily hundreds, it would be most fair to say that LOTR: The Two Towers stands as my favoured film. The middle of the stunning Peter Jackson trilogy, it is not the biggest or boldest, or most important, but I feel it is scene for scene the greatest film I have ever seen.The film is basically split into 3 separate but intertwining plots. First, we see our warrior trio (Aragorn the Ranger, Leglolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf) as they track across vast plains in hot pursuit of the somewhat depleted Uruk Hai party that has kidnapped Hobbits Merry and Pippin, before making way to the ruling town of Rohan. Then, there is the ring carrier Frodo and his trusty sidekick and friend Samwise, who wearily hike across rocky unfamiliar terrain en route to Mordor, which is where Frodo's mission lies. Lastly and by no means least, we follow the path of Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who find themselves in the huge, dark Fangorn Forest upon escaping their green skinned captors. It is here where they see an old friend, and stumble across the ancient natives of the wood, who just might join their cause.My favourite sub story would have to be the Aragorn one, as not only does that have the most battle and combat, but is also the main attraction of the film for me. It is the 3 fearless warriors who must help defend the people of Rohan as they take the dangerous but necessary journey to the mountain fortress of Helms Deep. Which is where they stand firmly together and await the sinister Saruman's next move.I would not recommend this to anyone who has not already seen The Fellowship of the Ring, as this carries on directly and the viewer would be trying to fill in the holes as events progressed. It would also not be as enjoyable if you hadn't seen the build up to where they are now. It is immensely gripping and exciting to see the story unravel, almost impossible to not be totally swept in by it all. Everything has been handled just as it should, there is a little humour, passion, stirring scenes of valour, plenty of sword fighting and battle to keep the action fiends happy. As for the violence, it is not disturbing or malicious, but brave and uplifting. The men of the West, Dwarfs, Elves and Co. are fighting for a reason, to save themselves from extinction, they do what they have to do for survival. It is a true case of good vs evil here, light vs darkness.Anything else? Oh yes, glorious cinematography, excellent and effective use of CGI, amazing New Zealand scenery, captivating dialogue and character interaction, not to mention great performances from Viggo Mortensen as the softly spoken yet ultra strong, bearded uncrowned King of Middle Earth, Bernard Hill as the noble Theoden and as always Ian McKellen shines as the wise and knowing Gandalf. Very few performances were bad in fact. Then again, this film has VERY little wrong with it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films in the history of LOTR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing about this movie that really catches my attention, is the special effects. THe director really did everything that he could, and what is needed in this movie, and made a movie from the book spectacular, and beyond stunning. This is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie of them all, and I have watched the 3 hour Extended version of the movie about 10 times over, and watched the extras on the DVD, which takes about an hour to complete. I must say I am one of those Lord of the Rings geek.One of the best movies of all time, and the best movie I have seen in all my time. The actors are so good with their roles it's unbelievable that they were acting, and not actually feeling it themselves, because I definitely did. This movie also housed a lot of my Favorite Actors, and they picked perfect people for all of their roles. Elijah Wood played an excellent role of Frodo Baggins, his character being the small, lost Hobbit in the movie, wandering with his one friend Sam Gamgee, who was also very perfect for his role. They made the elves look so real I wondered sometimes if they were born with those ears or not. The fight scenes in the movie also blew me away, especially the last one.This has to be the only movie from the book where I liked the movie better than the book, and I am not a person like that. I believe you get more involved with the movie than the book, and that is not normal for me. I am glad they haven't ruined the book with the movie, like a lot of directors do. Take a look at something like that Da Vinci Code, or Eragon, and you will see what I mean. The book is very good though, but also very long.I can easily just sit through 3 hours of this movie whenever I want to, and watch it over and over again at my pleasure, I know few people like me who can do that, and a lot of people watch a movie once and throw it away and never watch it again. I try to convince them to continue to watch it, but no one listens. The same thing happens with King Kong, I can watch that over and over again and never get tired of it.Definite 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers stands out as the second best of the Trilogy, the first being The Fellowship. The directive skills of Peter Jackson and how he managed to draw up nearly six units working together, is really awesome. The cinematography of Andrew Lesnie is very enthralling and I think he must have won the Best Cinematographer award for all the three movies. The guys at Weta Digital are really marvellous. Its because of their imagination that we got to see such a spectacular portrayal of moving images on the screen. Hats off to Stephen Regelous for creating the MASSIVE CROWD DEVELOPER software, which was used in the battle scenes. The soundtrack by Howard Shore is mind-blowing and the track, Gollum's Song by Emiliana Torrini stands out.The creation of the fully computer generated creature, Gollum is the highlight of the three movies. Its really amazing how such a character can be created using the keyboard and mouse of a computer. Each of its facial expression seems to be so realist, just like a human being. Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum is awesome. Gimli, the dwarf provide some humour to the movie, when all the other characters speak only serious stuff. I liked the Helm's Deep battle scene, where he asks Aragorn to throw him into the crowd of Orcs at the gate, provided he does not tell the Elves about it.Frankly speaking, I have never read the Lord of the Rings Books before watching the movie. But the movie has left me captivated into thinking how the imagination of human beings work. Its so marvellous.I guarantee that it is going to be the greatest movie for a long, long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely epic and well-made, The Two Towers is another success for the Lord of the Rings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers dwarfs The Fellowship of the Ring in size, scale, and the grandeur of the action scenes. While FOTR followed Frodo and co. as they started their journey across Middle Earth to destroy the Ring, TTT is our first glimpse at what happens in the bigger world as the Fellowship breaks - a war is being fought over this Ring, and the war is starting now... Needless to say, TTT is a bigger film than FOTR. Instead of about 100 Orcs and a troll against nine men, we have armies of thousands of Orcs and Uruk-hai, against armies of thousands of Men, and proper big weapons. And the results are amazing. The battle for Helm's Deep is brilliantly done - Braveheart can pack its bags and go home, this is the new champion of sword-fighting epics. The way tension was built up to the battle was brilliant - you found yourself practically drooling by the time the Men were gathered on the outer walls of the castle, ready for battle. And besides from ending with the smaller fights and starting with the larger wars, this film also started off some new plots - the story of King Theoden and Eowyn and the first meeting with Gollum (we got some glimpses of him in the last film but this film is his real introduction) - and develops these plots sufficiently for them to be continued and ended in the next film - the epic close to this great trilogy. This film definitely did not pass on anything, and though the relatively slim budget (believe me, $93,000,000 is not much for a film of this scale) tells you that a lot of it is CG, it is still bloody impressive, and builds more on the LOTR trilogy's status as an epic series. The Fellowship has broken, but the story is still far from over... 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best sequels of all time, and that's saying something when the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time.The Two Towers picks up pretty much where the first one left off: Frodo and Sam are traveling on their own to Mordor, Merry and Pippin have been taken by a band of Orcs and Uruks with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli hot on their tail. Saruman is now building a great army, Merry and Pippin run into a giant race of Middle Earth, Aragorn and co. go forth to save the kingdom of Rohan, and Frodo and Sam have some unexpected company in the form of Gollum. New paths are crossed, old ones are found; each and everyone of them as captivating as possible.Once again, everything is exceptional. From the sets to the acting to the visual effects - everything is top notch.Peter Jackson and crew have done a tremendous job of topping the original in terms of storytelling. The lines are bolder, the cinematography even better, and the direction spot on.Throughout the film, you can see Frodo being taken in by the Ring's power. It is also obvious that Sam is trying hard to keep Frodo from falling into the Ring's power, whilst Gollum's character arc is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie.Aragorn's struggle as he comes to face the realization that he must take on the responsibility of his forefathers' is done extremely well. Comic relief comes in the form of Legolas and Gimli's relationship (Elves and Dwarfs don't usually get along), and how hobbits Merry and Pippin react to the ways of the Ents. By no means aren't they informative, because they are, but they are at the same time humorous.The action pieces are once again on par with the drama and have clearly gone beyond what was done in "Fellowship". From the Warg attack to the climactic battle at Helms Deep, Peter Jackson truly shows his imagination is leaps and bounds beyond any other director.The cinematography is once again superb, and it deserved every bit of the Oscar it won. Sets are realized on a greater scope than Fellowship of the Ring. Edoras is truly a magnificent town upon the hill, whilst Osgiliath looks like it really has been war-torn.I didn't mention Howard Shore's score in my review of "Fellowship", but my thoughts on his music for the first film are the same for this one: It's amazing. Simply amazing. The score is now synonymous with the term fantasy. A melodious orchestra piece highlights the drama, whilst the trumpet sounds as the the bodies pile up during the fights.Like the first film, my gripe is that this is quite a long movie. This is necessary for an adaption which source is amazingly detailed, and besides, you won't get bored easily. Also, major characters could be off screen for over half an hour, almost as though they have been forgotten. But you'll be so intrigued by what's going on screen, that you too will forget about the other characters. It also helps that the change in character plots are seamlessly changed from one to the other.Peter Jackson has once again made a must-see movie. This will be loved by the most die hard Tolkien fan to the most ignorant of fantasy. As Saruman said in The Two Towers: "A new power is rising". With hindsight, we now know what that means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story, Epic Battle Scenes, Absolute Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me just say that I love Tolkien's original story The Lord of the Rings. It's absolutely a classic, and deserves much praise--as well as the cult following it's gathered the past few decades. But of all of the three parts of the story this one stands out apart from it's predecesor, The Fellowship of the Ring, and it's Sequel The Return of the King. The second part of the saga is definitely pivotal. Why? We are introduced to Gollum, The Kingdom of Rohan and it's characters, and Faramir of Gondor. Let's not forget the Battle of Helm's deep, Gandalf the Grey becomes Gandalf the White, or the The breathtaking March of the Ents.Despite certain liberties--artistic and cinematic--taken by Peter Jackson, it still does not mar the beauty or enjoyment of this film for me. While Boromir's death should have been the beginning of This film instead of the end of the last, and the spider Shelob should have made her appearance earlier I respect Jackson's decisions in that respect. With all that went on in the film version of The Two Towers--Battle of Helm's Deep and all--Shelob's Lair interjected into the mix would have made this seem "too busy" after all. (That's just my opinion, however.)Many viewers scoff at a miniscule modernism by Jackson, involving Legolas using a shield in a skateboard-like fashion. But honestly, if you blink you would miss it. All in all, it was well done--relatively true to the source material, exciting and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best of the three: courage, temerity, resilience and tenacity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After death, severance, separation, loss and confusion, we must regroup and recoup, rejoice and return. So let's save Gandolf first who shifts from The Grey to The White, from powerless to finally magical. The details are all accounted for in the DVD. Then the two hobbits that were captured and thought dead were only prisoners and they will manage to escape and even win the battle of the film, without anyone knowing it really. They will make friends with tree-herders and they will lead the forest against the bad wizard in his tower. And then the trio man-elf-dwarf will liberate some king in some city from the power of some middle man of a wizard and lead his people and troops to a mountain citadel, and this same man and same elf and same dwarf will have the surprise to see the king of the elves and his army arrive to reinforce the humans against the orcs. Some kind of slow growing seeds of courage and commitment. Some call that love too. And the battle will start, spectacular and grandiose, and many will die on both sides and the final salvaging reinforcements will arrive under the authority of Gandolf The White. The orcs will be defeated. During that time the two lost hobbits and the tree-herders will start a tree war against the malicious bad wizard in his tower with his mine and giant smithy underground at the foot of his mausoleum-spire that had provided the army of orcs with all kinds of arms, weapons and armours. And it will all go drowned and soaked, overflowed and flooded. That's how a battle is won, with some courage not to feel pain, with a lot of luck not to hear the warnings of Ms Caution, Miss Prudence and Mrs Carefulness, the three witches of passivity, and a fair dose of blindness not to see danger. And here we are with a long film for a young audience, though the audience of the first film must have aged a little and the film is becoming a lot more human. We even have several heterosexual kisses along with quite a few man-to-man embraces. Going on that way we may have a couple of weddings at the end of the third episode. And it all ends with two hobbits raiding the cellar and kitchen of the bad gloomy dangerous vicious wizard and we even find that funny, even if we are slightly worried for their waistlines. And the real end of course comes with the declaration of total trust from Sam the hobbit gardener who guards no one but cultivates friendship and Frodon the hobbit adventurer guardian of the ring and carrier of its powers to the final destruction site somewhere in hell. This episode though manages to leave monsters and other diabolical figures behind, which is good, and to emphasize more on the human qualities of all these characters. It even gets in a way marvelous for children with walking trees even if this is nothing but the rewriting of Macbeth, but Macbeth deserves many rewritings. And we recognize what is going to become one essential sign of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The main human hero in the Fellowship of the Ring, even after scattering and especially after it, is the surviving son of the long ago destroyed Northern Kingdom. He is a Ranger, a dying out category of peacemakers and justice executioners, just like Roland is a Gunslinger. But still, and that is going to last till the end I imagine, no bridge or door from this medieval fantasy world to our modern world and it is a shame. It is some kind of model for many sagas to come, but it stops short of real science-fiction when the fiction speaks of our own world through another layer of time or space.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I too was duly impressed with The Two Towers. I found it a better film than Fellowship, and still found Fellowship to be a great movie, so my impression of The Two Towers is that it is a great work.It's the second of three, and has not had the advantage Lucas had with The Empire Strikes Back. Potentially it suffers the same fate as Titanic, where everybody knows the outcome.(I was very surprised to hear Jay Leno broadcast that he has never read LoTR - that he has not read it is no surprise, considering who he is; that he should admit this is amazing: He's telling the whole world what they might not already understand about him.)Understanding that it takes jumping through quite a few hoops to pull off makes it all the more interesting to watch, but Jackson's sense for the dramatic is great. There are scenes leading up to Helm's Deep where the editing does it all - scenes that had the public in our theatre wrestling with themselves and their emotions, and there is no way Tolkien himself could have brought out such matters in the book itself.I think the music got a bid grandiose at times, a bit overpowering, but on the whole it was a good score, unlike the 'art' of composers Arnold and especially Williams who have this uncanny ability to totally ruin a movie.Gollum was a major feat. Many have said it's the best CGI ever, and one would be hard put to not agree. It certainly shames ILM thoroughly.Woods' Frodo is still a disappointment. One reviewer in the UK praised Astin for saving the scenes where Woods looks like he's going to make a pass at him. I agree: Woods more or less looks the part, but I don't think we're seeing great acting here. Astin, however, does a remarkable job - he does impress, and much more than in Fellowship.The girls love Orlando Bloom. His is a bit of Errol Flynn. My hero is Viggo, who doesn't have a clean face in 179 minutes. The portrayal of Strider brings home the gritty reality of a story that in book form was cloaked in niceties.The sex angle is mostly lost in the book too, but here we have lots of it, and a possible love triangle as well. This is well done of Jackson in my opinion: LoTR is otherwise too much of a 'guys story', and it makes it all so much more real.Time and again I found myself in a position - a predicament - unlike that of the reader of the book. Where the book offers a fantasy with lots of cool characters and a derring- do plot, the movie, with its incredible realism, makes you a part of the story, and you can't really close your eyes and fall off to sleep - you live in this world, a world that is basically an evil, threatening one.I think Jackson has transcended Tolkien: He's taken LoTR and given it a vision, and I am sure he and his crew have studied the book meticulously, and therefore been able to bring out detail most readers did not notice or soon forgot.Elsewhere at the IMDb one can read of dissatisfied surfers who don't want to wait another year for the finale, who think that six months is too long to wait for a SE DVD; and I think the irony here is thick.For starters, JRR Tolkien was a professor and expert and lover of the English language; and yet here we find some of the worst abuses of it ever. And no one seems capable of even reflecting on the themes presented by JRR; it's more about how good the CGI is, how good other special effects are, or in the best possible case how well the movie follows the book. And yet JRR had something very important to say. Here's a message that could be debated for a long time, with the human race the great benefactor.But no. We shall instead agree that Smeagol is well done and that some of the helicopter landscape shots are well formatted and that Treebeard is convincing, Mr Greenleaf is still the swooner, and that Aragorn son of Arathorn is a fitting successor to Middle Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many films which produce superior sequels. This is one of the few which do. If you thought the first film was great, wait till you see this once.The story is a lot more exciting, with it continuing straight after the last film. The actors which brought this world to life. They all gave outstanding performances again. Brad Dourif created a sinister Wormtongue and Andy Serkis really brought Gollum to life. I feel that if Serkis didn't portray him, to character wouldn't seem as real.All the special effects were superb. The use of 'bigatures' really improved the environment. If Peter Jackson and his team used CGI instead, i feel they wouldn't have captured it right. The CGI which was used was also very impressing. Trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are CGI, can be a real challenge. The character of Gollum was also a CGI masterpiece. Andy Serkis together which the characters looks, really brought him to life. The music was a wonderful treat again, and Howard Shore did another great job again. He really added to the characters and moved the story along. If you haven't seen any of the film before, i would highly suggest you catch them, as they are really a HUGE part of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,The Two Towers is superior to The Fellowship of the Ring in every way. The script is incredible, the music is even better (Especially the March of the Ents piece), and the characters are brought to life more vividly than before. Peter Jackson has cemented himself as a master director with his masterpiece adaption of JRR Tolkein's trilogy.The fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam are making their way through the perilous mountain range known as Emyn Muil, followed by a mysterious figure. Merry and Pippin are prisoners of the Uruk-Hai while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue them, unaware that a meeting with an old friend will happen soon. Gandalf is supposedly dead in Moria and Boromir's body has been recovered by his brother Faramir. Arwen has been convinced by her father Elrond that she must go across the sea to Valinor. In the meantime, Saruman marshals his army of Uruk-Hai and sends them into the kingdom of Rohan. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli evacuate the city of Edoras to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep, where they wait for the Uruk-hai to battle with them.The Two Towers is glue that holds the Trilogy together. Many important events happen that add tension to the plot. The battle of Helm's Deep is sheer brilliance and pure awesome. The Battle is graphic and spectacular with Gimli slamming his Axe into a Uruk-Hai's privates (Wonder how THAT got snuck in), Aragorn leaping onto a siege ladder and driving down a bunch of Uruk-Hai, and the totally cool scene where Legolas skateboards down a set of stairs on a shield, shooting arrows at the army of Saruman. The special effects are also sheer genius, particularly the Ents and Gollum. Howard Shore's awesome score rivals that of Hans Zimmer's Gladiator and James Horner's Braveheart scores. The Acting by the cast is totally amazing and the fight scenes are breathtaking.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gritty masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say that this is the most action oriented film of the trilogy. It has so many CGI achievements that it isn't even funny. And, in terms of action, tops the Fellowship by a long shot.This is a much more gritty war film, though, and doesn't have the cheery magical feel that the first film has. This is an action packed film that is pretty long. The only problem is, though I wouldn't really call it a problem, that it is kind of slow until we finally get to the big battle at the end.The Merry and Pippin story is, obviously, the slowest because they are with tree-beard. But I enjoy watching those scenes. They are so awesome from a animation point-of-view.But once you get to the battle and when the Ents start destroying Isengard, it's awesome!! (Not that the whole film isn't).I think, though, that this is of the three films has the worst replay value. This is an awesome film to see in theaters and, maybe, watch it on DVD once or twice. But you can't watch it all the way through like you can Fellowship without nodding off a few times.But still, this is an epic film that I love and wouldn't change a thing.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, read the book first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen all the original parts of "The Lord of the Rings" on DVD. I thought "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Return of the King" were the best of the trilogy, but what about this one ("The Two Towers")? Obviously, I didn't think this was as good as the first and the third parts of the trilogy, but it was still good. The battle sequence near the end was pretty much the high point of the second movie, but everything before that didn't have a whole lot of action attached to it.Of course, I would never, ever, ever give any of the "Lord of the Rings" movies anything below a seven or so, so I am giving this an eight.

		<shortDescription>a definite step down from part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.spoilers followFor example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). It is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable "artistic license".As an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced WW2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. Wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This second installment, from a production standpoint, was far ahead of Fellowship of the Rings visually. The effects had a much more tangible, polished feel to them. The story also carried less "pomp" to it, less feeling of faked excitement?the "look at us we're excited and pumped and you should be too?&nbsp;no, really" effect. That being said, I could not escape the injury done to Faramir, whose character had a solid nobility that lent so much to the Faramir/Boromir and father storyline. Without it, nearly a sixth of the storyline loses its solidity of purpose, and is an excellent example of how to cheapen the power of powerful stories.I could live with splitting the books at different moments (though it meant I felt like I was gypped at the end), and I could even see the appeal of diverting Frodo's quest, but cheapening Faramir's character for a conveniently timed "emotional moment" between Sam and Frodo just left me feeling like I'd been used like a cheap date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but the weakest of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is a good movie, but out of the three LotR movies it is by far the weakest.Peter Jackson's terrible choice in casting Elijah Wood as Frodo (a truly terrible choice that you would realize if you have read the books, given Wood's weak acting ability) is overlooked due to the mesmerizing performance of Andy Sirkis as Gollum, and Sean Astin's increasingly strong performance as Sam Gamgee.Other weak points include the Battle of Helm's Deep, which is completely changed for the simplistic cinema-goer having only a dozen remaining men ride out on horses (absolutely done for Hollywood's sake)as well as being poorly designed strategically. Then there is Peter Jackson's choice to make Faramir tempted by the ring, which completely changes the character from the book. As well, having to have Treebeard actually see the cut down trees to make him go to war (I can only suppose that having it this way instead of all the Ents deciding to go to war at their meeting, as done in the book, was done to accurately reflect the views of many people today: don't go to war unless it's right in your face, don't do anything to prevent loss unless it affects you). Then making Rohan look pathetic and having 2000 elves show up to help out was a little weak.Overall though, this movie is strong, and anchored by Gollum. Good but not great, though I would still place it above most movies these days.</fullReview>

Grima is an awful guy, but he makes me laugh and his scenes are my favorites in the movie. I did not know the name Brad Dourif before, turns out he's the voice of Chucky too! Awesome.What makes the LOTR trilogy so great to me is all the supporting characters in small roles, such as Grima. "The Mouth of Sauron" in the extended version of ROTK is another favorite. And Denethor, too.All in all, the cast is doing a pretty incredible job. My only complaints are Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Boromir (Sean Bean), and, of course, the fact that Cate Blanchett talks like a man. She's supposed to be this breathtaking elf, the most attractive female you'll ever find. And here she is with a voice like somebody's grandfather who's been smoking for fifty years. Still, these movies are brilliant and already classics. Bottom line.</fullReview>

Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun! Will the War of the Ring cause mass destruction and chaos or will the ring be fallen into the hands of the Dark Lords?TO BE CONTINUED..........BOTTOM LINE: WOW AGAIN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my comment on 'The Fellowship of the Ring' I made the mistake of stating I had not written any of the Tolkien books. Although not untrue, obviously what I meant to say was that I hadn't read any of them. And with this I again like to begin my commentary, as to make clear I value 'The Two Towers' as a movie, not as the filming of a book.The fellowship of 9 from part 1 are reduced to 7... uhm 8 and split up: Sam and Frodo keep on carrying the ring to Mordor, Pip and Merry are captured by some mean looking orks and the man, midget and elf trio are following these orks to rescue the two hobbits. Gandalf meanwhile takes a part as well, as he's 'reborn' even stronger and mightier than before. Talk about your deus ex machina...If 'Fellowship' was rather boring and one-directed (with events just happening over and over again until the three hours were full), 'Two Towers' is more intense but also more unclear and messy than that. It is darker than part one, but is introducing way to many characters that doesn't really matter for the continuing of the story. If part one had that problem, part two is taking it to new heights. Worst part are the dream sequences with Liv Tyler... what was that all about? Too long, boring and unimportant. Bad film-making.One of the main treats of Two Towers should be Gollum, or Smeagol (why not give every character 2 names so nobody understands it anymore). Gollum wants the ring Frodo carries, but finds himself loyal to his master as well. Now this could be interesting. Too bad nothing is really happening with this conflict, except the endless and countless monologues of Gollum... a missed chance.The end battle should cover up for everything, but it's more silly and slapstick kinda funny than intense (dwarf-tossing...). And of course it had to end with the second deus ex machina scene by Gandalf. On the other side of middle earth though things get even wackier, with silly looking trees (did they run out of budget?) attacking the Tower of Saruman. Watch out for the flooding scene... it has B-movie written all over it.Although I can understand why these movies are appealing to some (in particular the ones who love the Tolkien books), there is no way you can say The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever. There are so many moments the tension drops, so many silly hold-ups, a cast (although trying) undermined by the CGI. In a way, Two Towers is more compelling than Fellowship, but on the whole it doesn't even live up to it's very mediocre prequel. Let's just hope for the best for Return of the King. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord of the rings...When I saw the first LOTR#1 I was really confused about the plot, couldn't match one with the other, but since it was one of those movies with elves,I personally adored the idea so much to leave out the next two movies and first of all read those books! So I did. And now that I finally saw LOTR#2 I am disappointed. I watched it with a friend that didn't read the books, but saw the first movie, and he kept asking why and what and who and where, I don't think that is the way a good movie should be! The only pleasure part was the battle (good atmosphere, screenplay) and not to forget good chosen music! I know that this movie is a really hard job to do, but still this is no excuse. And after all the special effects aren't that great(Golum), but they aren't bad either. I'd call it all together a good try. But the movie as a whole has no atmosphere and that is sad because it's the most important thing to feel what you see. IT could have been amazing with that great story, cast, photography,... the effort to make it good looking can be seen and it looks great, but after all this is only the background "for" a movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not match up to "Fellowship", but nonetheless great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a year ago, during my winter vacation, I was surfing through the internet for movie showtimes. I had wanted to watch a movie with a cousin, and did not know what to watch. Curious, I looked up for this very movie and asked my cousins if it was okay to watch. My feelings towards the Lord of the Rings trilogy has never been any different since then.Having watched this before "The Fellowship of the Ring", I was introduced to a completely different world and at an awkward time, mind you. I was amazed at the many creatures, all the battles, and other bad things going on in this distant world. "The Two Towers" displayed many wonderful things on screen, including all the special effects, which was amazing to many audiences.A bit of advice: Do watch "The Fellowship of the Ring" before taking your time to watch this movie. In my opinion, "Fellowship" was a more joyful and more fun movie than this one, which was more appealing to me. This movie does not match up to it, but is nonetheless, great.Overall rating: 8/10--Great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film of the trilogy, and I went into the cinema without much expectations, mainly ensuring that I had a good night sleep the night before so I dont fall asleep like in the first one. I feel that The editors had given in to pressure and 'hollywood-ized' the movie. Making the pace faster, the action more pronounced and the plot, well, not making much sense. Let's say, helm's deep. Great sets, big army (which, I must add, looks like recycled effects from the Mummy Returns) and lotsa fighting and loud SFX that kept me awake. However, it seems that they have caved themselves in without so much preparing to fight (say, traps in the plains, what not.) There were NO flyers here, so why were there trebuchets in Gondor and not here? Sorry, none of it makes sense to me. It just seems to be a way to make the movie look 'Epic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was a decent film about the continuing adventures of Frodo, Sam, and the rest of the fellowship. It has great special effects, a new character named Gollum, and a darker story.Sounds good. But it's not really that good. The film does not in any way (except special effects) exceed the original. The movie's acting is nearly smothered by the special effects, and the story of Frodo is, amazingly, underused. The battle of Helm's Deep at the film's climax is great at first, but besides some Gimli humor to cheer the mood, it drags on and it sometimes seems as if the same thing you're watching now has happened before.Bottom Line: You tried, Mr. Jackson, but you just gotta learn that effects can be overused!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly, the Lord of the Rings fanatics are taking over ImDb. They have managed to voted "The Two Towers" into the number 4 spot on the all-time list. Ridiculous. Certainly, "Two Towers" is a good movie, but it has several problems that prevent it from attaining the greatness of its predecessor, "Fellowship of the Ring".First, all those useless, lingering shots of Liv Tyler make me conclude that Peter Jackson, as great a job as he has done on the series, could not resist the Michael Bay-like tendency to use his film as a platform for admiring the goddess-like qualities of some members of the fairer sex. Second, the slow-motion, close-up shots of the women and children cowering in the shelter of helms' deep, anticipating a gory fate. I certainly understand their fear, but all of these sequences seem manipulative and heavy handed. Frankly, I was plenty worried about the fates of the defenders without having to be reminded (repeatedly) by Mr. Jackson that there were mothers and children present, too. Finally, in "Fellowship", Mr. Jackson had a little less confidence in the patience of his audience, and he was therefore much more economical in his translation of Tolkien's narrative onto the screen. In "Two Towers", he throws economy out the window, and the film suffers as a result. When your film exceeds three hours AND you find yourself cutting in numerous slow-motion sequences, a little self-examination is in order. I am not calling for elimination of crucial elements of Tolkien's story, but successful adaptation from page to screen requires some clever narrative devices to truncate long passages into digestible visual material. In this regard, "Two Towers" is far inferior to "Fellowship". I hope that Jackson, in "Return of the King", shows more self-control.Still, Mr. Jackson is on the verge of one of the most extraordinary achievements in film history. He deserves all of his success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dwarf... beware the Dwarf...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picking up where "Fellowship of the Ring" left off, Frodo and Sam continue to trudge towards Mordor - with the annoying CGI monstrosity Gollum leading the way and mixing it up with Faramir (Boromir's brother) while Aragorn, Legalos, Ghimli and the newly resurrected Gandalf try to save the people of Rohan from Saruman's monsters and reunite the alliances of men. Chaos and mayhem ensues.Sadly, I didn't like this film as much as I hoped I would. It's a good film overall, but marred by the occasional slow pacing and unnecessary camera mugging. In other words: the dwarf, Ghimli. John Rhys-Davies is a great actor and he was good in "Fellowship", but he was terrible here (almost as bad as Rupert Grint in "Harry Potter &amp; The Chamber of Secrets" though not as bad as Jar Jar Binks). He doesn't even feel like he's playing the same character. Ghimli was a capable adventurer in "Fellowship" but in "Two Towers" he's suddenly become an idiotic clutz who can't ride a horse without falling off or get down a hill without tripping over his stubby feet. And then there was that "Toss me! Don't tell the elf!" bit. Oh god that was horrible; it's as if Aragorn was stalling just to make Ghimli say toss me. Peter Jackson wanted comic relief obviously but this was the best he could come up with? Pretty pathetic. I'd rather have a dull, ugly humorless fantasy epic than one who's only source of comic relief is an idiot dwarf. Oddly enough, John Rhys-Davies fairs better at being the voice of Treebeard of the Ents than he does at being Ghimli.Then there's Gollum, the most over-rated CGI abomination in the history of special effects. I can't even go in depth with this one...I did like Miranda Otto as Eowyn though, and of course I prefer Treebeard over Gollum, and I liked Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. The battle of Helm's Deep is spectacular, as is the Ents trashing Saruman's castle. Too bad the dwarf and Gollum had to ruin what should have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spectacular truly it is. And magnificent and epic. And another long list of nice adjectives. But it distorts heavily the character of the original novel. Most who voted did it thinking of Tolkien's work, I believe, and not of this production. I mean Jackson is an excellent director and I am a great fan of his, and even the first chapter was quite ok (although not astronomically great), but THIS chapter is quite bad. Battles are changed (for example no elves appear at Helm's Deep in the book, especially not high elves!), Gimli becomes a parody of himself, parts are added to the events (poor Faramir!), epic parts like the Ents are resized and reduced... the best actor is definitely the only non-human: Gollum. Or at least he's the one who respects the most the original script, in words and thoughts. As usual, those few who haven't read the book will love this movie. The others will probably just tolerate it. I hardly did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie fails where Part I failed too: only about half the movie is interesting. This time round the boring bit was Sam and Frodo who seem so stupid (they get into mortal danger each time we see them) and their journey tells nothing interesting. Even the appearance of Gollum can't save this dreadful story. The second of three stories is Aragon and friends who meet humans and then battle it out with orcs. This is quite interesting, but the battle and the end takes too long too keep me awake. But then there's the third story with Merry and Peppin and their fantastic story in meeting Treebeard. This part definitely saves the story from boring me to death and the end with the destruction of Saruman's Lair (the name escapes me) by the ents is one of the most impressive scenes I ever saw.Overall not a bad movie, but could be a bit more exiting in the Frodo Sam story line, I almost hope when they do something stupid again they just get killed or featured much less in Part III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that towers above the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI must admit that the Two Towers was my least favourite book of the trilogy which was why I was reluctant to go and watch the film when it came out at cinema. To be quite frank I was blown away by it! I felt mesmerised and bewildered by the fact that I enjoyed it more than the novel itself.The battle at Amon Hen in the first film is belittled by the massive siege of Helm's Deep with an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai. The battle is spectacular and has brilliant special effects; each person is individually modelled and the battle just looks magnificent.Also, a new addition to the trilogy is the interesting character of Smeagol who is completely computer generated. He also adds a light of humour to the otherwise dark, evil based film. We also see for the first time the Ents (giant tree-like creatures) who wreak destruction at Saruman's tower of Orthanc. The best scene, hands down, is the battle of Helm's Deep; the scope is so frighteningly effective it makes you feel like you're standing on the wall yourself. It easily surpasses the first film and stays in my top ten best films.The Two Towers is truly a movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, the two towers didnt EXACTLY follow the books by Tolkien, however I do believe Jackson still did a great job. As an adaption of the book, this film isnt that great. However, as a movie, this film is FANTASTIC! The film obviously couldnt be a precise adaption from the book, as that would be impossible. The book is filled with immense detail of every surrounding and every person, thing and story happening. If that was to be included into the movie, it'll be a 6 hour (boring) movie instead of the exciting three.I have to agree though, the scene where frodo, sam and gollum went to gondor wasnt necessary, I wanted to jump out of my seat also and exclaim that the scene shouldnt be in the movie. It didnt really serve any purpose, it wasnt completely necessary to include it.I have to say that Aragorn is so amorous! anything he says would make any woman melt, and lets not forget the charming Legolas.

The film is not here to replace the book, some Tolkien berserk Fanatics don't seem to get it. The film is not perfect, I agree, but perfection doesn't exist. Some things are changed from the book because it is a different media. Yes, Arwen has more scenes, the elfs join men in the battle of helm's deep; it's all part of the adaptation process. Arwen brings the emotional depth of the movie to another level. The elfs join men in the battle because there would be no tension if the audience thought there was no hope at all for the people of Rohan. Peter Jackson and his wife have done a fantastic job. I can't wait for the extended edition of TTT. The extended edition of The fellowship of the ring was much better than the theatrical version in my opinion.

		<fullReview>This review contains no spoilers (these are generally only typical of amateur critics)For those of you priveliged enough to have read my review of the film "Lords of the Ring", you will remember how I concluded with a clever prediction of "imminent inevitable sequels". Once again, I have been proven absolutely correct. However, I must concede that I didn't expect a sequel so soon (within about a year)!The good news is that this movie ups the ante on its predecessor with a considerably greater emphasis on action. It's a swords and sorcery roller-coaster ride with battle scenes of epic proportions. Once again, the fine landscape of New Zealand is the true scene-stealing star, and Mr. Jackson has impressed me considerably with his burgeoning directorial talent.It is an impressive film; probably amongst the very best of the large blockbuster films of the last decade. However, I do not agree that it should maintain position 9 on the IMDb top 250 where "Jean de florette" makes little impression at 246. For this reason I gave "The Two Towers" a 1, hopefully to bring it down a little. I implore the amateur movie critics of the IMDb to consult my greater knowledge and experience before making their own embarrasingly ill-judged opinions.Owing to the continued popularity of the subject matter, I believe this particular movie franchise could run and run. Expect numerous sequels soon, possibly within the next year!I hope you have found this review educational.

		<fullReview>Epic filmed version of the second (and weakest) volume of the Tolkein Trilogy. The first time I watched this I got about half way through and said, this movie is so damn good I can't believe it. The acting is great and the scenery and effects are awesome. I'm not quite as excited on later watchings. What has me bothered (particularly during the second half) is when the movie strays from the source material. The original story is one of the great fantasy works ever, why go off in other directions? It's not just that the movie is unfaithful to the book, it's that there's no reason for it to go elsewhere. I'm quite sure there's no one working the script with credentials approaching Tolkien's. So I just don't get with the point of following the books 80% of the way and playing with the other 20%, but I'll reserve final judgment until Return Of The King. Post script: I should have qualified my reservations about the changes - Haldir and the elves coming to Helm's Deep is a Jackson invention and the coolest thing in the Two Towers. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing; what's with all the over-hype???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS INCLUDED**I must admit that I was surprised to see how much fanfare and praise LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring got when it was first released. I'm not really a fan of fantasy films, I just enjoy good movies and, to my surprise, Fellowship was a pretty good one. In my eyes it was flawed no doubt; me not being versed in fantasy stories, much less Tolkien's books, there were some aspects of the story/characters that I didn't particularly like. But hey, that's my bias I guess. Nevertheless it was a very good film and I was actually anticipating its sequel, The Two Towers.Like almost all sequels, The Two Towers is a victim of the sophomore jinx. I wasn't as moved with Two Towers as I was with Fellowship. The battle scene was good, and the landscapes as expected were spectacular. But the story truly lagged at some parts. The whole business with the ?tree people' was pretty boring; although in the end we finally see what their purpose to the big scheme of things is. What was also annoying was how hard it was to understand what most of the characters were saying?.I found myself rewinding many times to try and make out what was being said. What was pretty surprising was how little we see of the hobbits, who are at the crux of the story. The Two Towers attempts to move at the same pace that the Fellowship moved at, but ultimately fails to do so. So many new characters were introduced to the point where you just lose track and cease to care about what is going on. So much was crammed into this film without much background. Fellowship kept you interested throughout, even through much dialogue and so-called ?slow spots'. The story of The Two Towers, however, lacks the same punch that Fellowship had, and simply lags at some parts. With all this said, this is the 2nd in a trilogy, so I can only hope that the final installment brings everything together to make the whole LOTR experience memorable.One more thing??I am surprised that these two films are rated so high here at IMDB (LOTR 1 at #6; LOTR 2 at #10)???? They are good films, but to be rated in the top 10 along with undeniable masterpieces like Godfather I/II, Shawshank Redemption &amp; Casablanca I feel is a travesty!! To the biggest fan of these types of movies/stories, could they really put this aside The Godfather, Usual Suspects, Memento or Casablanca and HONESTLY say that it ranks equally with any of those films? NO WAY!! I see nothing in these films that make them as ?groundbreaking' as the ones listed. Aside from the CGI eye candy what really is there to hold on to, like the marvelous ACTING in the films listed above? Will LOTR really be remembered 20 years from now as timeless classics like those? For the hype and monetary aspects, maybe?..but for the actual movies, I doubt it very much. I really feel the hoopla around the LOTR franchise is undeserved and exaggerated.The Matrix remains the only trilogy that hasn't disappointed, and for all of its groundbreaking leaps it still doesn't get the respect and recognition it truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps my judgment is a bit skewed, having camped out 30 hours for the premier of this movie and expecting to see the gates of heaven open up as soon as they turned on the projectors (I had high expectations of this film), But I think that Peter Jackson should be shot repeatedly with a BB gun for what he did to Tolkien's masterpiece. I mean, even in the first movie when he left out Tom Bombadil I could understand the reasoning. But if you're going to cut something for reasons of time, DON'T ADD ANYTHING! Everything that was added to this movie was total crap from an oliphaunt's ass. Any true fan of Tolkien should be incensed at the utter butchering of the story. I could go into examples, but I'm sorta strapped for time currently, and I'm sure they've been discussed at length here (I'm a little late, but I just registered here, so... well you know). The only redeeming qualities were the first 10 minutes, and the way they did gollum (although the portrayal of the character was more humourous than it should have been).All this being said... I'll probably end up buying the 4-disc special edition DVD and camping out overnight in preparation for Return of the King... :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Within.With the absolute genious of the Fellowship of the Ring, this movie had a lot of hype to live up to. However, I can safely say that this certainly does a more than adequate job of doing so. This movie picks up shortly after the other leaves off, both in terms of the plot, and in terms of the brilliance of the acting, directing, and cinematography.Peter Jackson once again proves himself to be the genious that he is. The first movie was more of an introduction piece, allowing those unfamiliar with the story to get acquainted, and those fanatics a chance to reengross themselves in the tale. This installment follows a much different course, as it focuses on the different internal conflicts of the characters. In particular it focuses on Aragorn, Legolas, Gimlee, and Frodo.While Fellowship of the Ring followed the hobbits around, this movie focuses more on the three warriors, Gimlee, Legolas, and Aragorn and has a bit more action because of this. The plot does not suffer from this added action, and still retains the balance of action and plot that was so essential in the first movie.The first movie had fight scenes, but they did not even compare to the fight scenes in this movie. Helmsdeep is one of the most impressive battle scenes in memory. Tens if not Hundreds of thousands of Orcs swarming the castle at Helms Deep fighting against the desperate people of Rohan. It is truly astounding.As in the first one, the acting is superb, and they do not ever really let the script slip. On top of all of this, the score is once again amazing and builds the suspense in the movie to an exceptional level.Two masterpieces in a row for Jackson.Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These films are little more than eye (lesser eye) candy. There are hideous omissions by Jackson. `A director ought to know better" Jackson DID know better. There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with Jackson's and his movie!' - Book II, paraphrase. How many people will NOT read Tolkien because of this 3 part film fiasco? Jackson could have stayed close to the text. The first glaring departure from it was when Gandalf did not use his staff to create a flash when Bilbo put on the Ring at the party. This allowed for many sins. There are worse faux pa, but I shall not mention them here, except for one other particularly nasty flaw... the mis-attribution of lines both to and by movie chaarcters. This is unforgivable. Here's a bad one- Wormtongue: `Ah, but you are alone. Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in? So fair, yet so cold like a morning of pale Spring still clinging to Winter.' I mean really, what have we here? Wormtongue the White? Grima the Poet? Gandalf said these words to Eomer. And there is worse to come. Alas that Peter Jackson does not drink from the chalice of misattribution folly and horror as we who have read Tolkien well! In sum, this quotation from Denethor II will suffice: `Have I not tasted it (the vileness of his straying from the written word) now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so!' I even fell asleep during the second flick...in the heat of the Battle at Helm's Deep. I do not think I care to see the third installation. One's imagination is brought to life by the words of J.R.R. Tolkien and said images are precious to me. Jackson's works are a denigration -- not an enhancement for me. I do not need my mind's eye disturbed so.Foo.Sincerely,Dr. Prevarite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not quite the same earthquaking cinematic experience of the original Lord of the Rings film, but The Two Towers still comes across as one of the most powerful and entertaining fantasy action films this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the greatest adventure films ever made, so it's really no surprise that its successor, The Two Towers, falls just slightly short of achieving the same powerful cinematic experience, but it is certainly a worthy installment in what is growing to be a tremendously well-made trilogy. The film starts off a little bit slowly, as it picks up where the last film left on in true sequel form, following Frodo and Sam as they continue their journey that was interrupted so suddenly by the end credits of the last film. This fabulously written film, which only takes artistic liberties in clarifying points that may have grown vague from the last film (the way the best adaptation films do), may go a little too deep into the amazingly intricate storyline to keep the attention of some of the younger viewers or some of those not familiar with the novels, but the experience remains just as intense and entertaining. The war for Middle Earth is officially underway, and the battle scenes are some of the most impressive that I've ever seen in a film. Generally, I think that a film with as many computer generated special effects as can be seen in The Two Towers is destined to suffer at least slightly from them, but they are so seamless and impressive here that they really do not take away from the quality of the film. The majority of the battle scenes are done almost entirely on computer, but are still incredibly entertaining and convincing. There are walking talking trees in the film, which was a little off-putting at first, but are successful adaptations from the novel and are amazingly convincing on screen. (spoilers) Pippin and Merry, the two characters from the original film with the insatiable appetites and the endless sources of comic relief, are back in the second film playing the same characters with very little change other than that they seem to have matured quite a bit from their original roles, quite possibly because of their increasing experience in the war for Middle Earth. They spend the majority of their screen time in the film with the walking trees, trying to get them to take them to the battle but having little success. But once they finally make it there, they make a surprisingly effective and creative contribution to their side's participation in the battle.Clearly, a black and white movie review written by some guy you've never seen or heard of (me) cannot do justice to the breathtaking things that happen in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. Brad Dourif, who is most famous for his role as the voice of the lovable Chucky, the doll from the Child's Play films, and for, I might add, his excellent contribution as the gas station attendant at the beginning of Urban Legend, takes on a role in The Two Towers that fits his iconography perfectly. This capable actor who has been acting mainly in B-movies for the majority of his career has made a seamless jump to a part in one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Now all we need is a part for Bruce Campbell and all of the underrated B-movie actors will be back in the spotlight!The comic relief in this movie is one of its best features (aside from the startlingly brutal and convincing battle scenes, of course), and none of it is cheesy or just thrown in to get a cheap laugh. There is a delightful scene where Aragorn (once again played spectacularly by Viggo Mortensen, in another of the best performances of his career) and Gimli (the lovable but amazingly powerful dwarf played by John Rhys-Davies) sneak around to the outside of the castle as it is being bombarded during the battle, and Gimli timidly asks Aragorn to toss him to the bridge because he can't jump over the gap himself, stopping Aragorn to ask him shyly not to tell the dwarf (Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom).This is a powerful adventure film that knows when to be funny, when to be romantic, when to make you cringe, cheer, cry, and gape. It entertains even through the slow parts, even going so far as to throw in a little schizophrenia scene with the little goblin that Frodo and Sam enlist as a reluctant guide. This scene is reminiscent of Geri's Game, Pixar's exceedingly amusing animated short film that precedes A Bug's Life, but like the rest of the comic relief, it does not dampen the effect of the rest of the movie by making it laughable, but rather allows us to relax between scenes of breathtaking scenery and cringe inducing battles. For the second year in a row, The Lord of the Rings is sure to be an enormous contender in the Oscar race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Translation is not an excuse for a movie filled with cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may not be a movie maker, or writer, or even a Phd in Tolkien World. Nevertheless, I am a great fan of him and of his books. I saw many commentaries around said that the issues on the movie are because of the difficult to make a book translation to the movies.It seems to me people are trying to refuse their own disappointments with the movie with this argument. The movements in the timeline of the movie are the first cliché, much like episode I and dozens of other movies. Lets make a quick comparison, episode I and Two Towers have three stories running at the same time: Frodo and Sam going to Mordor, Anakim Skywalker in a space battle, Gungans going to war in the fields, Merry and Pippin and treebeard, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin against Darth Maul, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Helms Deep. 1) Chances are against the characters (Ok...we need drama) 2-TT) Frodo is captured by Faramir at the same time that treebeard and the ents decide to do nothing, at the same time the fortress begins to fall. 2-EPI) Anakin is lost inside the Trade Federation Ship, at the same time Amidala and hers guard are captured by the Vice Roy at the same Time Qui-Gon dies. 3-TT)The new hope appears with Eomer coming to help Helm´s Deep, at the same time treebeard discovers that fangorn is being destroyed (how could he not know that already remains a mistery) and calls the other ents to destroy Isengard at the same time Faramir set Frodo free. I have only looked to this small part of the movie, but there´s more to tell about the whole of it, I will just tell about some more clichés: 1) The father that does not want his daughter to marry 2) The hero that everyone know is a main character falls in battle (and everyone knows that he will return - it adds no Drama) 3) The hero that does not want the power that is his. 4) The king that does not listen to counsel. 5) The calm heroes that doesn´t want to enter the war, although all evidencies seems that they had no choice. 6) The useless character that has a great idea (Pippin).There´s many more that I will not put here now. In my opinion, Tolkien´s world is greater than this and much more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals but story leaves to be desired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quote: The Good: In terms of cinematic and visual scope - astounding. The camera sweeps and the battles were awesome. I really felt like I was there. Gollum was probably the best aspect of the whole movie (his inner struggle was nicely done). Gimli's comic relief was nicely done too.The Bad: After watching it, I just kinda sat there going, "ehh...". I dunno, the first one has this magical appeal to me (seen it 4 times already) but this one just kinda fell flat. Maybe I set my expectations too high.For one, the musical score failed IMO. I could only discern one new musical track... everything else was either from the first or too ambient (Enya-like female choirs)Character development was nil for the new characters. It was too hard to get any feel for them. It just felt like, "here's blahblah, son of blahblah" and that was it. Grima appeared to come out of nowhere. The King's son also had barely any development and there was one other guy that I had NO IDEA who he was the whole movie (he was always around the King, helped put his armor on).I could tell that the main focus was the Helm's Deep battle. While that was awesome, the rest just felt kinda shallow and long winded. The first half was especially slow and the last was all fighting w/ no story to back it all up. What was with Gandalf riding in the last scene? Where did he find King Rohan's son? How did Rohan's son's army turn that big??? (in the beginning he said only him and his small legion still fought for Rohan). How did they manage to kill off like the remaining 2,000 or so of Sauraman's troops. Why did that Rohan lady fall in love with Aragorn... they only met for like 2 seconds.All in all it left me awed but a little unsatisfied. 6.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate in Action-Packed Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave Peter Jackson the benefit of every doubt I heard prior to my first viewing of the Two Towers. For this reason was I doubly shocked to see that it is no more than Mr. Jackson's own version of the story with nothing more than original names and settings. There was not one aspect of the book he did not manage to alter. This would not be such a problem, were it not for the fact that this book NEEDED NO ALTERING!!! These movies remain the most ambitious cinematic endeavor to date, but this most recent installment makes me desperately hope for an even greater one in the future. This movie shows no respect for the actual story, changing timelines, personalities, events, and everything else that could be changed while still seeming to be based on the book. In conclusion, the best thing I can say about this last effort is that it was thorough...thorough in its deforming the story, and thorough in disappointing this avid Tolkien reader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie, incredibly filmed without a detail spared. The action sequences are among the best I have ever seen. While it's easy to say that the development of the familiar characters does not hold up well as a film would be by itself, if you take this film within the context of a second installment of a larger series it is a flaw that can be easily omitted. The parallel editing sequence that occurs between the major battle scene and that of the hobits talking to the tree people is also oddly paced, making you wonder why Peter Jackson chooses to cut up a fast-paced action sequence with a slow, drab monologue. However, the pace of juxtaposed sequences definitely heightens the feeling of general anxiety that grips you by the throat as the film approaches its climax. The dialogue can also be trying at times...the Sam/Froddo dialogue about being "brave and strong" towards the end of the film is trite and cheesy. However, there are also times in the film where we find wonderful prose emitting from the same characters, allowing me to forgive their occasional verbal blunders. At the end of the day, I can forgive the film's tiny flaws for the greatness that shadows over it. This film will take home some major awards next year. I have to say...seeing this film on opening night, I felt like a kid again. This is the Star Wars for a new generation. Let's just hope that Peter Jackson will keep this story sacred, and will never have the temerity to pull a "Lucas" and to rehash these great films into Hollywood train wrecks 20 years later. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money well spent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crucial question about Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy seems to be: Is it just for Tolkien fans, or a "general audience"? I went to see it with my mom who's never read Tolkien; she liked Part I last year and liked Part II even more, but then she has her own cinematic agenda (based largely on sets &amp; costumes, plus she loves horses). As for the story, it was basically "good vs. evil" again; she noted that it's easy to tell one from another: the bad guys are hideously ugly, &amp; the good guys aren't.I read the trilogy over 20 years ago and confess I don't remember most of the middle book, so if Jackson made lots of changes, he could have fooled me. I remembered certain plot details from Ralph Bakshi's animated 1978 version. So I knew in advance more or less how Jackson's "Two Towers" would begin and end, the rest was up for grabs. By and large it didn't grab me, but talk about money well spent! The physical authenticity from last year's movie is, if anything, exceeded here, and as for SFX, the Gollum character alone deserves an Oscar. Can a computer-generated character be said to steal a movie? It's almost too good; I couldn't take my eyes off Gollum, even when he was off in the corner of the screen; I forgot the various heroic events occurring elsewhere. Inasmuch as I already know how the story ends, the warped "humanity" of Gollum afforded a poignancy to what I know will occur that I never would have anticipated. If there's a "tragic figure" in this tale, Gollum's it, whether it be "Greek" tragedy---"What a shame it had to be this way" -- or "Christian" tragedy --"What a shame it was this way when it could have been some other way."But for the most part I found this movie curiously uninvolving in an emotional sense. There's nothing here remotely as gripping as the death of Boromir in Part I, which made me cry each of the three times I saw it in the cinema. Part II doesn't even take time for a recap, just plunges in more or less where Part I left off and after a while I felt like a tourist on one of those meticulously planned whirlwind foreign tours, events kept rushing along--"Okay, here's this! Here's that! Let's keep it moving, folks, you can take pictures from the bus!" Part I told a wonderful story at what seemed it's own natural pace, and the three hours just flew by. Part II always seems to be running late, and IT'S three hours just pile up. **** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWING *******When the new Gandalf appears with the cavalry to lift the siege of Helms Deep, that should have been a real cathartic charge for the audience, but it almost seems over before it starts; there should have been more depiction of the tide turning, as was the case in Bakshi's version. Also there seemed to be too many things occurring simultaneously, what with Helms Deep AND the tree creatures showing up at Saruman's tower AND yet another battle with Frodo &amp; Sam on hand. It all seems to get cleared up lickety split so we can send the dynamic duo (plus Gollum) on their not-so-merry way to Part III. I remember Tolkien's Book 3 much better than 2. Jackson has his work cut out for him getting everything in. If he just does justice to the Harrowing of the Shire, I'll settle for that. Plus Sam's closing line.I almost envy the non-Tolkien viewers who can just watch a good yarn. Special mention for my single favorite shot, the procession of elves going away with the lanterns, plus the lugubriously juicy Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, a performance every bit as career-capping as that of black-eyed Christopher Lee as Saruman. Watch them in the tower scene with the army out front, it's two old veterans of cinema shlock working their magic. I can't wait for their big Harrowing scene in Part 3. DON'T SCREW THAT UP, JACKSON. Kudos to Jackson for the shots of the women &amp; kids helplessly awaiting their fate in Helms Deep, reminding us that those most hurt in war aren't necessarily the warriors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the middle movie about Middle Earth, whatever that is supposed to be. Is there an Upper and Lower Earth, a Right and Left Earth, or what?Anyway, as I watch the hobbits still on their mission to get the ring somewhere to do something with it, I cannot help but wonder why someone doesn't just make another ring, if they want one so badly. I mean, what one person did once, surely another person could do again. I'm sure there is some perfectly good, unbelievable reason why other evil rings cannot be made, but I am frankly past caring, because it has been six hours now, and I am really tired of it all.Especially wearying is the relentless epic-speak employed by almost everyone in the movie, which has made me sick of hearing the preposition "of." These people could never say something like, "We need to go through the Lincoln Tunnel" or "We'll have to cross the Golden Gate Bridge." They would have to say, "We must pass through the Tunnel of Lincoln" or "We must cross over the Bridge of the Gate of Gold." And even when they say something that might look like normal dialogue when written on paper, the characters utter all their lines gravely and ponderously, as if everything they say is of the deepest significance.An exception to this is Sam, Frodo's companion. He actually talks normally. As a result, he became my favorite character, the one I most wanted to hear from. And when he made his speech about the goodness of the world being worth fighting for, it had more effect on me than anything else said in the movie, because it was spoken naturally. Furthermore, Sam's face is easier to take than Frodo's look of angelic innocence. I wish Sam had the ring, and one of the other hobbits were his sidekick, leaving Frodo out of the story altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellowship was good. Two Towers was not good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are my point by point thoughts on Two Towers.--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship. It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead. I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film. I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a "whiter" version of oneself. Gandalf struts around like nothing happened. Also, when someone says that they were "sent back" from heaven "until my task is completed", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible. This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears. I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy. He's practically unwatchable. His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity. Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase. That's about it. One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves. Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain. Yes, we got it the first time it was shown. Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity. Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one? At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books. His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing. Everything is gray. The environments are gray. The skies are gray. The bad guys are gray. Gollum is gray. The orcs are gray. The weapons are gray. The buildings are gray. The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship. We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects. We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists. We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable. They're just generic caricatures to be "fought against" as necessary. There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end. A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography. The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies. Very little of this appears in this movie. We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies. You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks. At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies. To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes.--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks. It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do. He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed. Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know. The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight. They also walk around and put on armor. Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences. I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through. --This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history. Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick. Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important? Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out. That's it. Also, Liv Tyler can't act.--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this: there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie. Pippin and Aragorn are given "possible deaths", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character. Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism. I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative. There's not much in terms of spellcasting.</fullReview>

I fell in love with all these new actors I've either heard of, or never knew them. I loved it so much, I watch all of them 1,2, and 3!!! I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud! All of a sudden this creature named gollom comes down this mountain above frodo and sam... I don't think I had been so creeped out by this hideous thing, I even remember leaning against my father! I cant ever forget all of them! Elijah wood (frodo) Sean Astin (sam) Viggo Mortensin (Arigon) Orlando Bloom (Leagolas) John Rhys Davies (gimli and Treebeard) Ein Mkellen (Gandalf the Grey/white) Christopher Lee (sarumon)Billy Boyd (pippen)Cate Blanchett (galadriel)Liv Tyler (Arwen) Hugo Weaving (elrond)Dominic Monaghan (Merry)Miranda Otto (Eowyn)Bernard Hill (theoden)I loved all of them but I just think... personally The One actor who blew me away with his performance and worked soo hard for the film.... the one and only Andy Serkis. I don't understand why just because it was CGI that he couldn't get an academy for best actor... it gives me chills that he came that close to getting it!!! And yet he works so hard all those expressions and body movement are his.... that voice,HIS!!!!!!!!! For those who commented that they were surprised to see him act well out of the CGI well in order to do CGI you have to be a good acter with good expressions. Smeagal was him!!! cant you see that!!? Well, everyone was brilliant, great job Peter, a trilogy that will be remembered in movie cinema forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White.</fullReview>

And all his other writings. Heck, I even speak three dialects of Elvish and can write in dwarf runes and the runes of Daeron.... I'm a big Tolkien geek.And I understand that these books are impossible to adapt completely to film. But c'mon! Make an effort! These are beautifully shot, though filled with lots of CGI (which I detest). Beautiful scenery, able direction and OK acting. You would think I could give it at least 5 stars. I can't, and here's why: Don't make stuff up. Really. Whoever wrote this screen play is a servant of Sauron. What's with all the invention? It's a fantasy FILLED with fabulous work. Tolkien was a master storyteller. This screenwriter (unless there were several, in which case much is made clear. Nothing good ever comes from committee) really needed to leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having followed the entire production from green-light, I was entirely pleased with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. However, I did prefer the extended versions on DVD, with the voice-over commentaries and all. The shorter theatrical version of THE TWO TOWERS holds a very special place as perhaps the most exciting film ever made. True, it is not 100% accurate to the novel. It stands on its own. Theoden's speeches, the lighting used, the great Warg battle, and of course Gollum working as well as he did all contributed to an eminently satisfying experience. Every actor has taken their role and made it completely their own. The spectacular sets, particularly those of Isengard, blend so well with the natural beauty of New Zealand to provide both eye candy and attention to the fine details of model-making. The dramatic changes of scene to the approach to Mordor are dynamic. And Brad Dourif gives yet another creepy performance, being one of the finest living actors who has carved out his own niche. Perhaps this is a bit violent for younger children, but once they turn ten or so they will likely eat this up with a spoon. Never does the gore overwhelm, nor do the spectacular effects dominate the intricate story. Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers is an interesting film. It dosen't have a beginning and it doesn't have an end it's just their keeping 1 and 3 together. Gollum was a breakthrough in CGI and filmaking. After I saw the Two Towers I said to myself "CGI can do anything now." Besides the way he looked Andy Serkis was great as the voice of Gollum. I personally thought he deserved a nomination for best supporting actor. Their two things that ticked me off a little though, one was how Gandalf was not in the movie nearly as much as he should have been. He kinda just came and left. I read the books and I was hoping that Gandalf would be shown gathering the Rohirrim riders. Also something else that confused me in the movies is that, at the battle of Helm's deep elves show up?? That never happened in the book either but I guess their are things that are needed to be changed for a movie. Anyways besides those two things the movie was phenomenal. Peter Jackson did the best job anybody could do on a movie like this and it defiantly deserved it's nomination for best picture. The battle for Helm's deep was truly breathtaking to watch. When they defend the keep that exact moment was taken right out of the book and exactly how I pictured it. Well done Mrs. Walsh and Mr. Jackson you have done an amazing job on the script and movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TTT should be taken for what it is, a visually attractive, popcorn fun, crowd-pleaser. In this respect, the movie does it perfect. The action is well choreographed, and very interesting to watch. Peter Jackson is very good at this. He makes movies interesting. He makes movies fun to watch. This whole movie was a big story, with really no inner message. My mind did not go through any thought process this whole movie. I just sat in my cushioned seat, and absorbed the action/adventure fest this movie gave me. And as I said, this movie does that well.The cinematography was amazing. You could tell that most of the time making movie was spent in a little room, on a computer, animating Golem, who felt like a real person. Also, considering most of the background and sets were made by computers, they did a great job with that.The story also was very good, mainly because it is from what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.Also, the movie is very eye-catching, and you can tell Peter threw in some things just to make sure you were watching (Legolos jumping onto his horse is a perfect example). This makes the movie feel like "The Matrix", which is something many directors trying to make an epic DO NOT want.The love story could have been done without, as I forgot every part of the movie with that in it. I can't even remember who was in love with Liv Tyler. This felt like they were trying to add more meaning into the battle scenes with whoever she loved, but I could see no connection between the two.Also the character development... wasn't their. Unless you consider Gandalf becoming "White", or Frodo becoming woozier, character development, i felt none in the movie.There are many movies that I sit and wonder after, not because of I being confusing, because that is what the director wants you to do. The Pianist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, 2001, A Clockwork Orange and others all made me do this. After seeing this in theaters, I was right out of the theater, and discussing how "cool" the battle scenes were. Wow. Gripping.But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Throughout the whole movie, my eyes were fixed on the screen. I mean, almost any male, despite how "inner" they say they are, can't resist 25 minute battle scenes with fire and ogres.But this movie was easily forgotten in the thoughtful part of my mind. But it will always be in the "Wow! Look at that! Once in a lifetime!" part.I give The Two Towers: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The war for Middle Earth has begun, and we are given just a glimpse of what is to come. You read that right, a glimpse. What you will see in The Two Towers is only a hint at the epic grandure of next year's film, Return of the King. But I'm not here to talk about what is to come, I am here to tell you about what is now...and that, my dear friends, is The Two Towers.Everything that was good about Fellowship of the Ring and everything that made it one of the best films of all time is right here in The Two Towers. Epic battle scenes...fantastic creatures/characters...internal and external conflict on multiple fronts...treachery...magic...comedy...love...there is so much about The Two Towers that can not be confined within the limits of this Commentary. The Two Towers, like its predecessor, is very faithful to the written work of J.R.R. Tolkien; however, like Fellowship, this film does take a bit of artistic license to keep the audiance informed of what's happening in Middle Earth that Tolkien didn't mention in his Novel, and to keep the audiance engrossed and entertained for the near 3 hour film. Yes, the 3 hour (actually 2 hrs and 59 min) seems a bit daunting, but believe me that by the time the film is over you will be wishing for more. You will not be bored a single minute of the film. There is always something happening that will make you either cry, laugh (humor abounds in this film), or simply sit in you seat in complete and total awe.10 out of 10. This film is definate Best Picture contender....gollum....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Jackson smokin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say to the Tolkien fans out there that love Jackson's treatment, yet, with the same breath, blast Bakshi's version. What is wrong with you?? Yeah, Bakshi took SOME liberties but at least he kept to the story of FOTR and TT. Jackson, at points, seems to be telling a completely different tale and re-writing characters when it amuses him.I didn't think it was possible to make Tolkien boring but, unhappily, Jackson's TT proved me wrong. I wasn't the only one checking my watch many times during the film. I noticed several people in the audience doing the same.Now, I will say I did like the Director's Cut version of FOTR. However, I hated TT so much that I doubt I will even find the DC version appealing.Please, don't label me a purist, as that suggests unwillingness to accept different visions or interpretations of Mr. Tolkien's work. I do not mind changes being made to the story --- when they are good ones. However, Mr. Jackson and his gang of ink flinging scribes are not sophisticated enough writers to make these changes work or ring true.The wafer-thin melodrama he adds into TT, in order to build suspense, is laughable and obvious. Aragorn getting carried over the cliff edge was nothing more than another Hollywood cliche, already seen hundreds of times in other films, meant to keep the viewing masses on the edge of their seats. Come on!!! LOTR has not been so popular for all these long years for nothing. There is already enough suspense, drama and action in this epic. PLEASE, Mr. Jackson, don't add your muck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take out 5 chapters, put some made up rubbish in and you have Peter Jackson's The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't just missing small parts of the story; it's missing five plus chapters!!!The Fellowship of the Ring pleased me in that apart from small pieces it stayed, true to the original book. It was, I thought badly directed. I say this because I believe Jackson is at heart a producer. His organizational skills are amazing that at least is evident from the sheer amount of info LOTR holds within its pages. But he has no visual imagination whatsoever. Fellowship and The Two Towers are badly shot and badly edited. To put it in short I think Jackson is a second rate director who only got these films through blind enthusiasm, rather than ethical ability or quality of work.The two Towers is an insult to everything Tolkien wrote, Peter Jackson for some unexplained reason has gone from following the book of FOTR pretty well to just doing what he wants in TTT. The first half of the film is more or less true to the book and I was enjoying it. Gollum especially, but about half way through just after King Theoden and his people left for Helms deep in anticipation of the attack of Sarumans army, THE STORY WENT OFF THE RAILS LIKE A SPEEDING TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! With Aragorn falling over the cliff after the fight with the Wolf riding Orcs (WHICH WASN'T IN THE BOOK) as if that wasn't laughable enough, then the plot goes off into a dreamland about Aragorn and Aowhen's (sorry if her names wrong:) love affair and the choices they must make for the greater good. Well nice try in giving the story more depth BUT STICK TO THE BOOK!!!!!! I don't know about any of you but I went to see J.R.R Tolkiens The Lord of The Rings, not Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings. Ok it's still an adaptation, but FOTR was more or less the same as the book, why ON EARTH insult Tolkein's fans and Tolkien himself by taking one of the greatest works of fiction ever and changing it in any way you want. I think it was an attempt to fool everyone who haven't got the sense to read the books and make more cash on the side.THERE'RE AT LEAST FIVE CHAPTERS MISSING AT THE END OF THIS FILM. Now the people who I was chatting to today about it said well you cant have it all in the film it would be about 9 hours long. GRRRRRR! I said the annoying thing is if Jackson had left out all the rubbish he made up and put in the parts of the story, which should be there, YOU COULD HAVE FITTED IT ALL IN. I am of course referring to Shelob the great spider, which bites Frodo and then Sam takes on the Ring himself and the bookends on a cliff-hanger. He's chucked that out and put it in the next film, The Return of the King, which is already the longest book anyway, without putting huge chunks of story in from the other films.If you ask me Jackson has quiet literally lost the plot and in some style, instead of creating a realistic and accurate film on Tolkein's book he's done what he wants with it and I'm sorry but I think he should be slapped for even having the nerve!!!!!The only people who will totally enjoy this film are the ones who haven't read the books AND SADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.BUT I'M DREADING WHAT HE'S GONNA CUT OUT AND EVEN MORE SO WHAT HE INVENTS TO STUFF INTO THE NEXT ONE....A YEAR OF DREAD IS AHEAD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a 2002 epic high fantasy adventure film[6][7] directed by Peter Jackson and based on the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. It is the second installment in The Lord of the Rings film series, preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and concluding with The Return of the King (2003).Continuing the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, the film intercuts three story lines. Frodo and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, meeting and joined by Gollum, the ring's former owner. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come to the war-torn nation of Rohan and are reunited with the resurrected Gandalf, before fighting at the Battle of Helm's Deep. Merry and Pippin escape capture, meet Treebeard the Ent, and help to plan an attack on Isengard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" has just the same amount of heart as "Fellowship", but on a much bigger scale. In this film, the fellowship from the first film is now split up into small groups of two or three, but in a way they are closer than ever. The last film showed how the characters care for each other inspired courage in them, and how without each other they were nothing. This film shows this on a bigger scale, not just uniting the characters even closer, but the races of humans, elves, and ents, showing that in the end they are all fighting for the same cause, for some good in the world. This film introduces one of the most tortured and iconic characters of the series, Golemn... or, Smeagle. At first glance he seems like a monster, but really he is just torn into 2 halves, one loyal and scared, the other dominating and deceitful, and everyday is a struggle fir him. Sam dislikes him and distrusts him, but no one understands his struggle more than Frodo. Frodo has seen it almost happen to Bilbo, and its happening to him. The ring is beginning to overtake him. Frodo needs to know that Smeagle/Golem can get better, because then he can believe that there is still hope for him that he can go back to the way he was. There is a large war in this film with great action, but the action also highlights the way in which the characters have developed. They work with each and help each other not to survive, but because they care for each other, and they know that they must unite against the bad that there is in the world. There are great character moments such as the moment where Gimli asks Aragorn to throw him, showing his trust for him while in the previous movie he states, "No one throws a dwarf".Mary and Pippin are almost killed, but they run into a forest and are taken away by ents, who turn out to be rather friendly. But when they meet to discuss what they should do about this war that is happening, they choose not to intervene. Mary is upset because he knows the long term effect of what will happen if the orcs win the war ("There will be no shire"). But when the ent sees fields of his fallen friends, he knows that he must fight with those that are still alive with him, because you can use apathy to hide from the dangers of the world as much as you'd like, but eventually they will catch up with you, so the only thing you can do is fight for what you have left. At many times it seems there is no hope for the characters, specifically Aragorn and Frodo, but Aragorn continues on because he knows that Arwen will be waiting for him on the other side. Frodo continues because, as we find out through an incredibly heartfelt speech by Sam, they believe that there is still good in the world, and it's worth fighting for. That is just one line from his fantastic speech, but it embodies what I love about the Lord of the Rings movies. There may be hobbits and elves and orcs and magic and dwarfs and wizards and even talking trees, but it is a deeply human story. Just like our world, there is also lots of hate and temptation and evil, but eventually it all passes, because we have people like Frodo and Sam, who are not super heroes, but normal human beings who are scared and absolutely need each other to regain courageous, but they know that there is good in the world that is worth fighting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a thrilling three-hour epic that flies at a gallop, boasts the most impressive computer graphics yet created, and succeeds smashingly as grownup drama and kid-captivating fan. When Gandalf arrives with reinforcements, descending a near-vertical slope using horses where you or I would use snowboards, the spirit of triumphant rampage is something rarely glimpsed since the days of Olivier and Henry V. To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better. The battle for Gollum's mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story I'm beginning to wish would never end. Part two is more a straight-ahead action flick, substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film. this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloriously epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the continuation of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, "The Fellowship of the Ring", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).This film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. In fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize Tolkien, an English writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't English or don't speak English as their mother tongue. Suddenly, not only everyone spoke of "The Lord of the Rings" and Tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages &#x200b;&#x200b;and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation.Epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization. In fact, make an epic film in the old fashioned way, with hundreds of participants, large and elaborate scenarios etc. it's extremely expensive, more than resorting to the modern digital techniques.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers - aka: "the one that usually gets mostly skipped during a LOTR marathon". Perhaps a film that was continuously mistakenly referred to as "Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers" released the year after 9/11 was always going to have a bit of a rough go standing out amidst the splashier, more gratifying bookending acts of its franchise. It's obviously still a masterpiece - no one disputes that - but, being heavier on the action, hardship, and lacking major punctuations of narrative momentum, definitively the black sheep of the trilogy (notice the lack of Empire Strikes Back comparisons from those talking' Tolkien). But this marginalization isn't fair, as it overlooks how much The Two Towers does accomplish - arguably, the subtlest, cleverest film of the trilogy - and how indispensable it is to the meat of Tolkien's triumph. If Fellowship is all about "why we fight" with its vision of the joyful, utopian tranquility of the Shire worth preserving at all costs, and Return of the King is all about triumphant closure, The Two Towers has the tricky task of being the 'the night is darkest before the dawn' hump of the trilogy, establishing the full scope and ripple-effects of the battle for Middle Earth, and how crucial victory is for an increasingly fleshed-out world. Jackson takes this to heart - fittingly, The Two Towers is literally darker, filtered through barren browns and blueish-greys. This darkness also amps up the violence in the notoriously most action-heavy of the trilogy. At the point where Bilbo was extolling the virtues of pipe weed in Fellowship, in The Two Towers, we're greeted with a pile of steaming, charred orc bodies and heads on stakes, having just waded through the massacre of a helpless village, and an interlude of orc cannibalism. Yum. But Two Towers isn't just viscerally grim: it also delves the most into addiction subtext. Andy Serkis' sublime, show-stealing work conveying the schizophrenic eager puppy dog and warped spitefulness of Gollum (including Frodo's tearful plea regarding why he has to believe Gollum can be saved) and Rohirrim King Théoden (proud, powerful Bernard Hill) withering at the hands of the seedy Wormtongue (the sickeningly perfect Brad Dourif) allow for quieter, moving moments of pathos amidst the more grandiose macro conflicts. It's also easily the most political, with the Ents vs. Isengard vignette proudly hammering (ha) Tolkien's anti- industrialization theme, while Treebeard's Entmoot conference is a deliciously sly parody of the slowness and inefficiency of bureaucracy in crisis situations, especially when intercut with the ferocious battle of Helm's Deep. Meanwhile, the Rohan refugee crisis has a distressingly topical political urgency of its own, keeping a human face on the devastation of Sauron and Saruman's machinations.That said, this is still the same movie where Viggo Mortensen makes out with a horse. Astutely aware of the heaviness at play, Jackson mines for comedy respites whenever he can, with many thanks to John Rhys-Davies' 'Gimli the comic relief dwarf', while Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd may as well be playing Harold and Kumar given Merry and Pippin's glut of pipe weed gags. It's a testament to all their exemplary work that their characters still integrate loveably rather than feeling gratuitous. Similarly, the fight scenes are as exhilarating as can be, with the warg fight and Ents releasing the river each invoking cathartic roars of joy, while the rain-drenched battle of Helm's Deep is a classic setpiece of vintage war tension (the opening Gandalf/Balrog plummeting fight is also fun, but a weirdly video- game-y note to open with).Jackson, now faced with cross-cutting between parallel story lines, masterfully keeps track of his overwhelming deluge of story while keeping the pace ticking. While the dour whininess of the Frodo/Sam segments do grate over time (perhaps the resonant work by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin conveys suffering too well?), the addition of Gollum and, later, Faramir (the subtly magnetic David Wenham) keep the dynamic interesting. The new cast all shine in their respective moments, including Miranda Otto's feisty, lovestruck Eowyn, and Karl Urban's bold Eomer, while Ian McKellen finds interesting notes of metaphysical remove to play as the resurrected Gandalf, and Viggo Mortensen makes every beat of his hero's journey achingly, inspiringly empathetic. All the while, Middle Earth is as sumptuously gorgeous as ever (a panoramic shot of Rohan framed by the mountains with Howard Shore's soulful single violin theme in the background is arguably one of the most beautiful in the trilogy), while the CGI remains seamlessly magnificent (Treebeard in particular is a gloriously detailed creation, each notch of bark and creak of movement stunningly realized, while the Ringwraith's 'winged beasts' are also fearfully entertaining creatures). Then comes the final payoff: a montage of triumphant victory between Helm's Deep and the conscientiously objecting Ents turned Isengard-flooding activists, coupled with a show-stopping, tearjerking speech about "stories that really matter" speech by Sean Astin. It's a long time coming, and the film's middle lags in anticipation of it, but dear god is it worth the wait - an inspiring triple-whammy that brings the house down more than almost any other moment in the trilogy. All of the immaculate, dazzlingly intricate visuals, blood-pumping combat and moving characters aside, it's these moments that really sell the soaring, larger-than-life, transcendent emotionality of the franchise. And this is why, black sheep or not, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers remains classic movie magic, and one of the most essential, incompatible films of all time. -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers immediately starts where The first film ends. The Fellowship have split, Merry (Monaghan) and Pippin (Boyd) are captured by the enemy, with Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) in pursuit. Ring-bearer Frodo (Wood) and his trusted companion Sam (Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring. Although the Fellowship's disbanded, they are united under one cause; to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from taking over Middle Earth.New friends, enemies and obstacles are met along the way. Men become the focal point in this one, represented by Rohan and Gondor. Are they strong enough to defeat their common enemy? Will old alliance's with Elves and one another come together when they most need it? New themes accompany the old. The few are against many. Even in impossible circumstances the forces of good will try. The love between Aragorn and elven princess Arwen (Tyler) is threatened by morals and a lady of Rohan. The Two Towers almost surpasses TFotR in terms of quality and depth. Howard Shore's composition is just as powerful than before, and the effects team up the ante with the biggest, jaw-dropping battle to rival Gladiator's or Saving Private Ryan's. J.R.R. Tolkien's work can do no wrong in the hands of Peter Jackson and his writing crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow the two towers, despite featuring some of the greatest battles in the LOTR trilogy, is the movie I like the least out of the three. In the extended edition it's just really, really long. I can handle Tarkovskijs, so usually I don't have problem with long films. There's a flashback that allows us to see Boromir at Gondor before going to the council of Elrond, which might have been unnecessary, as we learn about his and his brother's singular relationship with their father in the next chapter, that eats up a lot of the extended edition. While I understand that this is a 2002 movie, and Gollum was well portrayed both by Andy Serkis and the CG department, I don't like some of the CGI in this film. Those oliphants in a scene just look fake. Personally, I believe that ILM did some better job on attack of the clones, despite even Episode II of the Star Wars prequel trilogy lacks of some realism.The two towers was a movie I liked, just didn't like as much as the other films in the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie you would want to see with friends. The movie picks up right where the first left off. The acting is basically the same as the first, same characters, same plot. I give it a 8 because of not really adding much new content (maybe different disputes different characters, maybe ?) You also may want to see it at night, because it's dim in some scenes. Safe for children as long as there is a parent. Contains moderate violence, not much intensity. Profanity not hardly any. When I saw it I was amazed on the film and budget they put into it. It is truly a must-see for middle-earth fans.I recommend though watching Part 1 first, as it explains a lot what's going on. The movie pasts expectations, so don't judge it just by the title. For a 2002 movie it is truly epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking A Deeper Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{This review is for the 179-minute theatrical release.}The quickest way to burn three hours from your life is to sit down and watch this crisply structured, breathlessly paced, yet thematically rich dose of cinematic CPR. You will come out feeling refreshed, revived, and wondering where the time went.It's a bleak time for the denizens of Middle Earth, the evil powers of Sauron and Saruman forming a union against the beleaguered forces of good. While a small army of men from Rohan make a forlorn stand in a mountainside redoubt, two hobbits, joined by a nasty critter who answers to the name of Gollum (Andy Serkis), make a lonely, harrowing trek into the heart of enemy territory, on a mission that seems unlikely to end in anything less than their doom."Do not trust to hope," is a characteristic piece of advice offered to another party of good adventurers. "It has forsaken these lands."Director Peter Jackson reshapes the problematically structured middle novel in J. R. R. Tolkien's "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy into a stirring centerpiece for his own epic cinematic adaption. Each shot has almost a painterly quality, a classical shape and texture that informs every frame.While Tolkien's source novel is the weakest of the saga, Jackson's film is the best of his own trilogy. Instead of long narratives, Jackson and his editors, Michael Horton and Jabez Olssen, present a triple-track approach where something is always happening, often very fast. At the same time, the script by Jackson and his writing team plumbs story elements for drama and tension that Tolkien at times barely limned. Gollum's story is the film's emotional arc, as we see in him a tortured soul not quite beyond the reach of redemption, however dangerous. His mad lust for the Ring of Power is not only dramatic in itself, but ominous for the lead character, Frodo (Elijah Wood) who now carries the Ring and sees in Gollum the potential for similar madness in himself."The Two Towers" does an effective job reintroducing the characters, good and evil, we met in "The Fellowship Of The Ring" and investing all of them with qualities of deeper interest and humor to extend our investment in them. At the same time, "The Two Towers" broadens things with a slew of new characters, most especially Gollum (Serkis is never seen on screen, but he was both a voice-actor and a motion- capture artist on screen) and Faramir (David Wenham), brother of troubled Boromir seen in "Fellowship." Both Gollum and Faramir find themselves tested by the very same thing, and their different reactions help drive the rest of the film.There are minor weaknesses in this film, most particularly a needless detour where the brave human leader Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) temporarily goes missing. Some lengthy exposition elements featuring my least favorite characters, the Elves, grate on my nerves. But the spectacle and storycraft overall are brilliant in the main, and even better, become more enjoyable when the film is watched again."The Two Towers" is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride that keep you as mentally stimulated as it does visually ravished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was just as thrilling as the others. This movie is one of the best. I thought that the whole concept of the movie was great! Although I like Lord of the Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring was better, I still enjoyed this movie a lot. I think that this movie is a must see. Although, it is recommended that you watch the first one first though, because it could be confusing as to what is happening. Another Lord Of The Rings related movie to watch would be: The Hobbit. That movie is also very good and thrilling. That movie is a prequel to The Lord Of The Rings. All about Hobbits and Elves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Rings:Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's cut to the chase. The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is everything you've been told and so much more. The second part of JRR Tolkein's Middle-earth trilogy is a cinematic rush of blood to the head that exhilarates, astounds and enchants, and leaves you hungry for more. Following the death of Boromir and the apparent demise of Gandalf in the pit at Khazad-dumb, The Fellowship divides into three groups. Hobbit friends Frodo and Sam head for the Black Gates of Mordor. En route, they befriend Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis ), a mysterious creature deeply scarred by his previous encounter with The Ring. The path ahead is riddled with dangers, including Faramir, the brother of Boromir who hopes to use The Ring's powers to save his kingdom of Gondor. Aragorn, elf archer Legolas and plucky dwarf Gimli make haste for the besieged Rohan kingdom, where they pledge their support to the beleaguered King Theoden and his beautiful niece Eowyn. The advancing armies of evil wizard Saruman force the Rohan people to abandon their home and head for the sanctuary of Helm's Deep. However, the king's duplicitous adviser Wormtongue, a spy working for Saruman, anticipates Theoden's risky strategy. Meanwhile, hobbits Merry and Pippin escape from their Uruk-Hai captors and head into the mysterious Fangorn Forest, where an age-old ally offers a glimmer of hope to tipping the balance back in favour of the forces of light. The visual effects in The Fellowship Of The Ring were nothing short of staggering, bringing to life hordes of fantastical creatures including platoons of snarling Uruk-Hai and the monstrous Balrog. These achievements (which were rewarded with an Oscar and a BAFTA) pale into comparison next to the technical wizardry conjured up in The Two Towers. The digital artists have surpassed themselves, creating jaw-dropping action set-pieces such as the climactic battle at Helm's Deep, which features more than 10,000 warriors fighting to the bitter end in a vast mountainside fortress. The scope and richness of detail is breathtaking, and it's hard to believe that many of the landscapes in the film exist solely in the hard drives of the animators. They look so real. Of course, luscious visuals would mean nothing without equally powerful performances, direction and scripting. Thankfully, The Two Towers delivers on every single level. The ensemble cast continues to excel, evoking a menagerie of wondrous beings caught in the midst of a titanic battle between good and evil. Wood gradually reveals the desperation and rage bubbling within Frodo as The Ring begins to take hold of him, and Astin is intensely moving as the best friend who would sacrifice everything - including his own life - to ensure Frodo reaches Mount Doom and achieves his goal. The rapport between the two actors seems so easy and comfortable. Once again, McKellen is majestic as the wizard guiding The Fellowship on its perilous path, and Mortensen accepts the hero's mantle with gusto, cutting a swathe through his enemies and facing death head on. The love triangle involving Aragorn, Eowyn and the elf princess Arwen simmers tantalising in the background, and will undoubtedly boil over in the final instalment of the trilogy, The Return Of The King. The Two Towers continues Tolkein's trilogy in grandiose style, casting a spell that is impossible to resist. The only disappointment is how quickly the three hours fly by, and the agonising 12 month wait until Frodo's quest is finally resolved. And you get the feeling that will be something very special indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but still worth a watch for fantasy lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is the middle piece of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings"-trilogy. Awards-wise the least successful, I would also classify this film inferior to 1 and 3. It starts with the plot twist that Gandalf is actually alive and we see Gollum for the first time, the visual description of what the ring does to people. For the most part, we follow Sam and Frodo (group 1) and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (group 2) after Boromir's death. Sam's behavior towards Gollum stood a bit in contrast to his warmheartedness with Frodo, but apart from that I liked these two story lines and also the introduction of Gollum (possibly the most interesting character from the trilogy). I really was not impressed at all with the storyline of the King who obeys to his evil snake servant and the whole family business of the king. Aragorn looking at the traces and seeing that the two Hobbits must still be alive was complete nonsense. The tree creatures (on which the Hobbits spend pretty much the whole film) were quite nice though. However, there were some problems with these too. The tree promised Gandalf nothing would happen to the Hobbits. So how come these Hobbits climb right that tree who vowed to protect them. He sure did not follow them. He was even sleeping before they woke him up. And why does he think they are Orcs at first. And when did the other hobbit duo become brave enough to scream at the trees to get them to help? They were just fools before all that and I just cannot see them transforming into credible heroes. Nonsense, I say. Also they don't even ask if Gandalf is still alive.Another thing I wondered was how Aragorn knew that Sam was with Frodo. But that's just a minor criticism. One hour into the movie, Frodo and Sam are at the gates of Mordor. So what would happen the next 2.5 hours. Well.. the kingdom story happened and it did nothing for me. You can say yes it was in the book, but still you can cut the uninteresting parts and maybe make this an hour shorter and avoid the dragging. And that guy's name was Wormtongue? Really? That sounds like it would be the villain from a children's film. Or Harry Potter maybe. Anyway, the character was played by Brad Dourid, roughly three decades after his most significant role in "Cuckoo's Nest", an interesting snippet in my opinion. Also the farewell song for the King's son did not move me at all. The whole story of Miranda Otto's character and Aragorn I could have done without. It added nothing really.Saruman stays the main villain here just like in the first film, so it is a bit surprising as everybody keeps talking only about Sauron when it comes to LotR-villains. The creatures in this movie were top-notch, just like in the first, especially the Wolves of Isengard. Gimli provided comic relief again and it helped a lot that he had Bud Spencer's dubbed voice. Great fan here of the spaghetti westerns. That scene where he asks Aragorn to throw him and not tell "the Elf" was very funny. The main characters keep surviving under the most difficult circumstances that you sometimes wonder if they are actually immortal (Aragorn here in particular, and Gandalf early on as well). Liv Tyler looks pretty nice and so does Orlando Bloom, but the latter did not do really much for me. His character is so interesting, but acting-wise and story-wise it was all very underwhelming about Legolas. Back to Frodo and Sam, I liked the issue if Frodo's friendship with Sam could survive Frodo's ring connection with Gollum. Which of the two is stronger? You may need to wait for film 3 for a final decision. And please disregard Frodo's constant visions and deliria. These were not done convincingly at all.The big problem this film has that despite its stunning visuals, it is fairly uninteresting from an emotional standpoint. Neither the kids having to go to war as soldiers nor all the groups of fighters spectacularly coming to help our heroes at Helm's Deep I found particularly captivating (except the trees maybe, that was slightly intimidating). The second half of the film was weaker than the first I felt, mostly thanks to Gollum's introduction and presence early on. At least Gollum gets the final scene, so we can look forward to him in the final film. Random note: Why is Smeagol not naked and why does he wear a slip if he cares about nothing but the ring. We will never know. After that scene, we hear the closing credits. And while I liked Enya's song from the Fellowship, this one is a disappointment. It sounds much more like a Bond song and brings none of the fantastic aspects of the film to the table. I recommend this film to fantasy lovers. If you somehow enjoy the very overrated "Game of Thrones" and still have not seen Jackson LotR trilogy, it is high time. They will enjoy it, but I cannot call this film an epic, or the whole trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough has been said about this now I think so I'll keep it short. Just watch the extended edition, it has better character development and just plain better story telling. Also, the theatrical cut feels more like it only tries to impress with visuals and CGI. Now years later we've seen better special effects so it doesn't impress as much anymore. What's left is storytelling, world and character-building. In conclusion these are my scores: Theatrical cut: 6/10 Extended edition: 8/10 Now I'll just write some more lines so that IMDb excepts my review. Because that's what IMDb does, it forces you to type longer reviews even if you have nothing more to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far my favourite film of all time. The action, the story, everything is absolutely mesmerising. The film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. My all time favourite scene would be the Battle of Helms Deep, it gets me every time. The action and the emotions in those scenes were just at its peak. You fall in love with the characters instantly from the first film and you invest so much of your time in them without any regret! I first watched this film when I was 9, I knew I had just watched a masterpiece. The flow of the film is just so easy and it is so easy to understand what is going on, which is amazing for a complex storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it in every trilogy that has ever been planned (I repeat, planned) the second one is the best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm judging all of the Lord Of THe Rings movies completely on their own merits - I have never read the Tolkien novel nor did I get my hands on the extended edition and neither did I see the animated movie made in '78. When I did sit down and watch Fellowship... It was okay but I can see why it has the large fan base that it has. With this it is so much better.Frodo and Sam are now moving closer towards Mordor away from the group and is now being aided by a crazy hobbit with grey skin on all fours called Gollem, who was obsessed with the ring before it was stolen. While this is going on Aragorn and Legolas try and catch up to the other Hobbits that were taken away by Orcs but in a Kingdom (I said I'm not a fan so I really don't remember what it's called) that is threatened with war by Sauroman and after they find out Gandalf didn't die from the last one but he kind of, sort of moved to a higher level of power... somehow. They stop Sauroman's influence on the King and they decide to retreat to a Safe Haven called Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam then get captured by another Kingdom under attack by the evil forces and they must hold their own and battle for survival.I really liked the story for this one. If there is anything to talk about in terms of complaints with it, I don't know if Sauroman dies but I think it could have ended there. And while the story at it's roots is more of the group fighting for survival than Sam and Frodo following Gollem to Mordor I really think it worked, particularly for the subplots (on top of the main plot of course), I liked the cinematography, acting and effects. All of these work really well in the movie's favour. I can also say this is a time in which I cared about what was going to happen, like there was something bigger at stake, I mean in the first one it shows this too and it is done well but here we are shown more of this world and it's inhabitants, thus making what's at stake seem bigger.If there is any complaints it has to be the fight scenes. They are done well but I just think the characters evade death just that one too many times in the Battle Of Helms Deep. There's even a point where Aragorn is fighting the army of 10,000 with the Dwarf (not a fan, apologies for not knowing his name) as they're coming to the door and there is not a single scratch on him as if he is a better swordsman then all the 10,000 orcs combined. It's nitpicking - yes, but it just really bugs me. I can also say I didn't really like Gollem as a character and the comedic relief, now it's switched from the 2 Hobbits to the Dwarf Aragorn fought with at The Battle Of Helms Deep. The jokes aren't cringe-worthy, they're not "Please stop" bad but I didn't laugh at one of them.So again I can see very clearly why it has it's fans, I think I might be a fan if Return Of The King is as good (yes, I am one of those people that wonders if a movie will be any good after winning critical praise and 11 Oscars). It is a really good watch if you are into fantasy (although, watch Fellowship first). I might be in a minority when I say I do think it's still a little overrated (the key words being A LITTLE) but if you want a good three hours to watch something, provided you've seen the first one and you like fantasy - this is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR: The Two Towers review - my least favourite of all three parts, but an astonishing fantasy/epic adaptation and continuation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOTR: The Two Towers continues from where the first part (The Fellowship of the Ring) left off. It's about getting to Mordor! It's about the quest, the journey, the effort, THE RING! Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee travel to Mordor. Starting with a unique flashback, it sees Gandalf the Grey take on the fierce and ferocious beast, Balrog. The whole point from here on, after the flash back, and in continuation to the first film, is for Sam and Frodo to ultimately destroy the ring, thus destroying Sauron for good. Having received critical acclaim and fresh, positive, and deserving reviews from critics and fans alike, The Lord of Rings: The Two Towers was a huge success - both financially and critically. The ultimate adaptation, in many ways, outshines its predecessor, the first part from the year before. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is my least favourite of all three parts; but it is, nonetheless, an amazing film with some stunning effects, gripping action and battles, and exquisite acting/directing; particularly, in the acting part, for me, it's Sir Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen. They're all wonderful though --- of course. I award LOTR: TTT a strong 8.4/10. Unlike the first part, I rate a 10, and the third I rate a 9.5, this one isn't as high up in the ranks, for me, but I love it nonetheless. Fantastic masterpiece and enjoyable/intriguing continuation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter brilliance marred by not sticking to the formula of the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything aside from the plot was marvelous. The novel's split of the eastern and western events were skillfully interlaced with one another in the film to create scenes that progressed together chronologically. Many of the light moments in the novels were brought to full light and made quite funny in the film. Gimli got the majority of these entertaining lines. The huge helpings of makeup and CGI were a monumental undertaking and they were executed so perfectly that they had me saying "WOW!" even 12 years after the original release in front of a TV. In this sector, the film's makers stepped up from the first. I cannot wait to see what is in store for the third. It pains me to have to give this wonderful masterpiece a 9. Alas, it did not stick to the books as it should have. By this I do not mean every single detail; I mean that there were major story and geographical alterations that should not have happened. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there were scenes like the hobbits' adventures with Tom Bombadil that were completely omitted. This is understandable as it would not have contributed significantly to the story as a whole and, thus, would only be added weight in terms of runtime. Also, minor changes (eg., "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" and flashbacks) served to improve the quality of the movie. However, in The Two Towers, things such as Aragorn being shown defeated and near death after the Warg fight (which was a semi-major battle that never occurred in the novel in the first place) are major changes to the plot and tend to harm the movie, especially with fans that love this fantasy series so much. It seemed like a clear attempt to milk the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen to its fullest, while this aspect of the film was not given too much attention in the novel. Additionally, Faramir was shown to be drawn in by the power of the Ring. This bothered me the most because Faramir was quite a good character and one to look up to in the novels. His respect was earned when he immediately showed he was unlike his brother and did not lust after the Ring. Changing Faramir to possess the same traits as Boromir is a bit of an insult. But, like I said earlier, minor changes serve to ameliorate the movie or add as much of the story as possible given the budget and time constraints. Adding an army of elves at the battle of Helm's Deep made the already enthralling action even more so. Having Éowyn present at Helm's Deep as opposed to Dunharrow allowed the heat between her and Aragorn to grow more quickly. Frodo hiding Sam and himself with his cloak in front of the Black Gate added more suspense. Lastly, it must be said that the music played throughout the movie was incredible. The film would not be nearly as impactful without its presence.For the "everything else" portion, a solid 10. If only the plot had adhered to the novel....

		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" is a rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty. It also gives us the character of Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures I've seen. Gollum was long in possession of the Ring, now entrusted to Frodo, and misses it ("my precious") most painfully; but he has a split personality and (in between spells when his dark side takes over) serves as a guide and companion for Frodo and Sam. His body language is a choreography of ingratiation and distortion.Jackson has taken an enchanting and unique work of literature and retold it in the terms that even modern movie-goers can enjoy. To do what he has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers is a truly fantastic film it has everything you could want from an adventure/action film. I also love its prequel The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring and its prequel The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King. I would give all three films 10/10. I believe this trilogy is the best trilogy that has ever been made I love all 3 of these films. Out of the 3 films I believe that this is the best of them due to the battle near the end of the film and every time I watch it I find myself drawn into the sheer awesomeness of the battle. I also like this film more than the others because I believe that Legolas shows his true talent during the final battle in this film (Legolas is my favourite and I am very pleased he is in the new Hobbit film the Desolation of Smaug).Truly Amazing. Love This Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They'll never make a better remake of this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The movie The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's second novel in the Lord of the Rings series. The series is an extension of The Hobbit and carries on the story of The Hobbit Bilbo Baggin's nephew, Frodo. On Bilbo's original dragon slaying quest he comes across a ring, whose original bearer was Smeagal. Smeagal was originally a hobbit, but when fishing one day with a relative he came across the ring and killed his relative for it. The ring has show much power that Smeagal migrated to deep down in the mountains and became a shell of a man fading away but had his life prolonged by the ring and in the end becomes Gollum who has a split personality and talks to himself. Gollum becomes barely recognizable as a hobbit and Bilbo stumbled across the ring and Gollum deep in the mountains, ends up with the ring and carries this burden a while and then passed it on to Frodo. Now Frodo and his best friend Sam escape from their hometown and embark on an epic adventure filled with danger in order to have Frodo return the ring to where it was forged and destroy it. The ring was made by dark lord Sauron who is a wizard gone rogue and Sauron's life source is bound in the ring. When it was forged it was forged with this curse: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the middle part of this epic journey and simply sheer genius. The book is phenomenal and the movie a classic. They'll never be able to make a better remake of this movie. - Asif Zamir</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame to see that the Two Towers did not receive quite as high of a rating as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. In my honest opinion, Two Towers is the best of three.The Two Towers is a great follow-up to Fellowship. The great thing about Two Towers is that it is a bit more complicated than Fellowship, since in Two Towers the fellowship has broken up and the movie follows each of their own stories. I love the introductions of the new characters present in this movie.The landscape scenes are even more breathtaking than in Fellowship.My favorite parts of the movie are the battle sequences. They are intense, complete with Howard Shore's epic score, and feature realistic effects.The Two Towers is practically perfection. Like with the other two, I have hardly anything negative to state about this movie. Peter Jackson absolutely nailed it in a way that I don't think any other director could have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite of the trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second opus of "The lord of the Ring" was one of my favorite of the Trilogy. This second opus shows the different path the main characters take and how they will deal with the different obstacles they must overcome.The main stage of this opus is the Battle of the Hornburg and it's really epic. Showing the allegiance between humans and elves. It was for me one of the best scene of the trilogy, maybe because I'm such a huge fan of Legolas and his peers ;) , because this Battle of the Hornburg will decide the destiny of the human race and this scene was so so beautiful. You feel all the emotions in this particular scene : fear, rage, pain, sadness, hope, joy, ? We have a mix up of our feelings and you are really into this movie. One of my favorite moment was when Gandalf shows up with the Theoden's army with the light of the sun behind his back. It was like a miracle. Because during all of this time during the crucial battle, the spectator has suffer of this whole mix of emotion that in the end you thing that Gandalf will never make it in time and it's over. You see a sea of blood with corpses everywhere and you feel desperate like "They will be dead" and "Bam" Gandalf is back as he promised and you regain hope as for the others characters.The soundtrack was extremely wonderful and well done. They have insert some extract of the music from the first opus and remix it to give it a new color. It was a fantastic job to have incorporate some extract of the first opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers Transcends its Antecedent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is everything I could have hoped for in the second movie in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. In this film the fellowship has broken and the film now follows three different adventures taking place - you have Aragon, Legolas and Gimli fighting to protect Rohan, Pippin and Merry occupied with the Ents, and of course, Frodo and Sam lead by Gollum to fulfill their quest to destroy the ring. I really liked how these concurrent endeavors were told without feeling, as the viewer, disengaged from the main idea of the story. For example, it didn't feel like there was intolerable jumping between different scenes to follow these different adventures, so I thought the movie proceeded at a good pace. Hats must be taken off to a perfect embodiment of Gollum's character and it is probably one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen in a movie. This twisted, tortured and disturbed creature is the epitome of the consequences of holding the ring for prolonged periods (500 years in Gollum's case). The ring is so evil and corrupted that Gollum represents the end result of it's control, which should signal to Frodo to make haste of his quest or else he'll end up just like Gollum. The amount of action and fighting in this movie has increased compared to 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and I loved it. It was so satisfying to watch Legolas and Gimli kill Orcs so proficiently to the point where they keep a running tally of how many they kill. This form of humor embedded in several fighting scenes was much accepted and it wasn't too excessive to the point where it felt like the humor was forced. Just like the first movie there are some epic panning shots as Aragon, Legolas and Gimli cross some stunning terrain, and I feel that just the mere scale of this movie is so much bigger in magnitude to that in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. In the previous film, there was a lot more dialog and felt like more of an introduction to the characters and the 'culture' of the 'Lord of the Rings' film, which isn't condemned, but 'The Two Towers' steps up the fighting scenes to another level without losing the dialog and character development. The sheer size of Saruman's army sent a shiver down mine when I first laid eyes on it. You think to yourself, "hold on, how are 300 'good guys' supposed to defend themselves against 10,000 of these brutal and viscous Orcs?" Thoughts like this that leave you wondering what's going to happen next or how are the 'good guys' going to deal with this crisis is one of many reasons that kept me engaged in the film from start to end. Furthermore, I loved Gandalf's return as 'The White', and the scene at the beginning where he battles the Balrog was an epic way to begin the movie. In addition, when the Ents destroy Saruman's headquarters was just insane to watch. I loved that feeling of gratification, yet also some sorrow, when you see the Tree Beard begin to lose it after what Saruman has done and the Ents just unleash chaos on Saruman. It was satisfying to see the 'good guys' (I dislike referring to them as this) finally overpower Saruman as he has been the one with supreme power and authority throughout the film (excluding Sauron). You can't also help but feel when the Ents take revenge on Saruman for destroying their 'friends', that one day, in today's modern, developed society, nature will reclaim what is rightfully theirs one day. The idea of conveying the trees as having emotions and allowing them to feel anger and sorrow just like humans do, makes you condemn things like deforestation around the world and the negative impact human consumption is having on the earth. In essence, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and cannot wait to watch the final film in the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 2 of the longest movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The longest movie ever made, so long that the director had to divide it in three parts, and that's why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end.In "The Fellowship of the Ring" we start with the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) towards to Mordor, lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring, an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the "One Ring" and thus save the world from the darkness.In "Two Towers" we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs, with the army of Saruman (Christopher Lee) marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) along with the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) joining in the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron, now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol (Andy Serkis) who wants by all means his "precious".And finally in "The Return of the King" we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo, who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie, the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending.Peter Jackson (director-writer) brought to life the masterpiece of books, "Lord of the Rings" by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made, if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books, Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say it's just a movie because all three movies work as one, from the beginning to the end we realize that.Since the first film (or first part) we have the magic of Tolkien's working here, along with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (writers) have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkien's work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship, courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection.Not only the writing is phenomenal, but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie, so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent.A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast, "The Lord of the Rings" is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Power Is Rising. Its Victory Is At Helm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every film consists of three acts; The first is where you introduce your story &amp; its characters. The second is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces &amp; character development takes place. And the third &amp; final act is where you tie up all the loose ends to bring your entire tale to its conclusion. Almost everyone has a definite idea of how to begin &amp; end their stories but the middle act is always the most difficult. Because no matter how great the other two acts are, if this part isn't handled well, then the overall experience ultimately amount to nothing in the end.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga &amp; just like the novel, it has no definite beginning or ending. What's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple story lines &amp; all need to work. And the good news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel as faithfully as its predecessor did, it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that improves upon the original.Picking the story right from where it was left off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship &amp; intercuts three story lines. The first concerns Frodo &amp; Sam who, on their journey to Mordor, find their peril deepen for there is another who hunts the ring. The second deals with Merry &amp; Pippin, who were taken as hostages in the last film. And the third covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas &amp; Gimli who, along with an unexpected ally, head to Rohan to warn them of an impending war. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad- d?r, fortress of the dark lord, Sauron, &amp; Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but director Peter Jackson manages to do it once again &amp; what's even more admirable is that he gives equal importance &amp; value to all three story lines as the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers &amp; the decision to conclude it at a different event from the novel sets a perfect stage for the finale. Also, it is extremely well written &amp; narrated for enough time is given to develop its new characters, without ever interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades &amp; are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress with its meticulously detailed sets &amp; is ideally fused with the gorgeously photographed landscapes of New Zealand. Camera-work is at its absolute best during the action sequences, Make-up, Costume Design &amp; Sound retain their qualities and Editing trims it down to 179 minutes but just like the last time, I recommend the extended edition for it adds 45 minutes of new footages which further enriches its overall experience.Weta Digital's VFX team made history with The Fellowship of the Ring but the enhancements it brings in The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum &amp; Treebeard are entirely CGI &amp; it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity &amp; breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Howard Shore's magnificent score continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure &amp; is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers adds even more strength to its ensemble cast as the reprising actors once again chips in with faithful performances while the new ones instantly make their mark felt. But the most notable amongst both the new &amp; reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum/Sméagol. Heartwarming &amp; heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic &amp; jaw-dropping performance that it's easily the finest acting of the saga, so far.On an overall scale, The Two Towers is a smooth continuation &amp; a worthy expansion of the world that was brought alive in The Fellowship of the Ring. There are a few artistic license taken but it all stays within the realms of Tolkien's world &amp; remains true to its spirits. Succeeding as another spellbinding &amp; engrossing masterpiece that effortlessly blends art &amp; entertainment into a staggering epic, The Two Towers is an immensely satisfying sequel that ably meets &amp; exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor &amp; signs off by setting an even higher bar for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium. One hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, good set-up for Return of the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an outstanding film. It had excellent use of practical effects combined with CGI, and continued the character and plot development quite nicely. I was a little disappointed at first with the changes made to Faramir, but after hearing the director's reasoning I must conclude that he has a good point. Treebeard grew very tiring though. I know that's kind of the point, and the Ents' behavior is even remarked upon, but it didn't make it drag on any less. Gollum was awesome. Andy Serkis really knocked it out of the park with this character, setting a whole new standard for performance-capture. The big battle was good, but lack of variation had a very slight detrimental effect. I also enjoyed the new characters introduced, though I wish we could've seen more of Eomer. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that everybody and his brother or sister has had a chance to weigh in on this film, I will put in my two cents.I won't be making any comparisons to the book because, the fact that I am a voracious reader not withstanding, I wouldn't ever pick up anything in this genre to read. Watching a movie is different.The Two Towers is a spectacular swashbuckler, a skillful combination of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty.The star is clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits are almost an afterthought. We also have the Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures ever seen. How can we not mention Cate Blanchett as Galadriel.The sound and visual effects make the most of any TV.

		<shortDescription>The middle movie of the trilogy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is the second movie of the trilogy of The Lord Of The Rings. In this movie we wait to see a big fight between the army of Gondor and Saruman's army of Uruk Hai against the allies who joined Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin and Merry. They have to defend Rohan and attack Isengard. Frodo and Sam continues their way into Mordor to destroy the Ring.The cast of this movie is about the same from the previous movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", but we have some additions. Peter Jackson makes a very good direction once again. The sound and the music of this movie once again is perfect such as the previous movie was and that was something that it's not gone unnoticed because of its nominated for the Oscar of Best Sound and won the Oscar of Best Sound Editing. It also won the Oscar for the Best Visual Effects and nominated for the Oscar of Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and of Best Film Editing.All these are based on the novel of J.R.R. Tolkien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a first rate epic. From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world. From Gollum to Helm's Deep, the special effects are innocent fun and spectacular. I think Helm's Deep is unbelievable though. Peter Jackson knows what he's doing. He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real. That's why I think it's unbelievable. How could this happen? I don't know. But all I care is that at least it's good.The movie will utterly be remembered years from now and so will the other two parts i.e. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that the initial shock and marketing campaign has passed, we can take our time to watch the movie as it really is. The storytelling in this movie is exceptional. Although a serious J.R.R.T. fan would say that the story is not 100% accurate, it's my humble opinion that the changes made, for the movie's sake, are totally acceptable. Especially in the extended version, that shows a lot of little details that contribute a gigantic amount of comprehension to the story. I'd say it's the best of the trilogy, and one of the strongest points for that consideration, is that the amount of action scenes is remarkably balanced with the rest of the movie. Size effects and special effects are almost up to date 10 years later. Overall, an outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many claim that LOTR: The Two Towers is the worst film of the trilogy, it has been and remains my favorite film of all time. It is the film where Sam and Frodo really become more than just friends. It is the film where Faramir, my favourite character, shows his quality. It is the film where Rohan defeats Saruman. I absolutely love this film for it's emotions. I admit that it is not as epic as The Return of The King but it has more to it in the plot development. It is altogether more human in its appearance. I find that the third is all based around the epic battle, and the first is all about the setting. It is the second that gives Lord Of The Rings its feel. :) I gave it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring's Second Foray Suffers From an Overabundance of Minutiae</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson and friends apply their epic vision to LotR's second chapter, although this material doesn't sparkle in quite as many ways. While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a prelude to a mediocre finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is where The Lord of the Rings trilogy reared its head. The excitement about the first movie wore off a bit due to a year's wait until the release of the second installment. It was still romantic and epic, as you would expect as a proper movie based on J.R.R. Tolkin's book.However, there were elements of a regular Hollywood blockbuster which would eventually get hold of the third movie. The battles are becoming larger, the special effects grander, yet they were still well balances with superior plot in order to capture my attention. The merit for latter goes to Tolkin, though, not to writers who managed not to get carried away.In The Two Towers we were still in a magical world with some dark changes. The characters are multi-layered and are developing as the dark menace of Mordor is slowly unraveled. There were some twists and surprises, but also we knew that there was one more movie to go until the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is one word that can describe 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' : incredible. The best epic movie of all times. The stories blend in with each other, forming the scenery of Middle earth in war. The characters, tempted by the power of the ring, straggle between the good and the bad. The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning. Great performances, in addition, give the movie the excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I loved the sense of tension, hopelessness, and buildup at the Helms Deep battle. It really made you feel like all was lost. And finally, at the end when backup arrives, you feel a sense of relief. The simultaneous occurrence of this and the trees helping at the other battle really gave a good climax.Acting and scenery were great and the pacing of the movie was great. One issue, I had, though, was that the size and power of the help which finally arrived at Helms Deep didn't seem that grand. They should have better emphasized or shown greater numbers to show the overwhelming great win which occurred.I liked this one way more than the first one and it was my favorite of the three. I don't know why this is the least popular one by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the extended version of Two Towers on DVD a 10 out of 10. But believe that the theatrical release is only a 9 out of 10. The theatrical release had some holes that were nicely filled in the extended DVD release. The theatrical release was a little confusing when it came to some of the scenes with the exiled Rohirrim. I truly enjoyed all 3 movies and recommend them. I do believe Two Towers was the most difficult of the books to translate to the big screen. I remember when reading the series that Two Towers always felt like work to get through, where the Fellowship of the RIng provides the joy of discovering Tolkien's fully realized world. The Return of the King gives us the climax of the entire venture. Given the extra time in the extended DVD version of Two Towers, Peter Jackson delivers a more compelling coherent story than the original book.Michael</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an awesome follow up to the fellowship of the ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helm's Deep (which was kind of the movie's climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys- Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).After you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.The movie's plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helm's Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Saruman's forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helm's Deep.The three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didn't just run to Helm's Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.Not winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost. Not as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You can't watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fellowship of the Ring was an amazing first installment. Everyone knows that sequels are nine out of ten times worse than the first. In the case of The Two Towers, it is the tenth out of ten tries to improve upon a first installment with the first nine failing. What makes The Two Towers a rare film? The Ugly: Same as Fellowship. Not a thing. The Bad: The Two Towers' theatrical cut runs the same 3 hour length as the first installment original cut. The extended edition runs at almost four hours. My Rare The Great: A rare sequel that is as good as or better than the first. The Two Towers was the best sequel since Toy Story 2 three years earlier. The cast also has a greater variety of actors that the first did not including Bernard Hill (Titanic). Final Verdict: Everything is better in The Two Towers than Fellowship. And that is saying a lot because Fellowship of the Ring was an amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few sequels that is considered better than the prequel...but they are both awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lord of the rings: Two Towers(2002) continues the story epic story following three individual tales of the main characters. First is Frodo and Sam meet with Gollum to find a way into Mordor, Pippin and Merry who meet with Treebeard to destroy Saurman and finally Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf have to save Rohan from Isengard. What can I really say: it's awesome and better than its predecessor, but you really can't say either is better because the lotrs as a whole is what makes this film franchise popular and loved by millions. The difference between the first and second is that the second increases the scale of the film to a whole new level (by only increasing the budget to one million more?) this is the reason why Jackson is just a genius as a whole. Jackson knows the core material of the book and mixing his own ideas into this project gives it the extra touch of creativity thrown in along with cool visuals, good character development and touching emotional storyline. You do in fact notice major character development with this movie and it is what I think Jackson had in mind when creating the second. First for build up, second for character development and third for massive impact and climax. that's what I think but may not be true but its how I see these movies. The acting is great as usual with more characters included such as the vile grima wormtounge, faramir captain of gondor and the noble and strong eywon(maiden of rohan) plus they are allowed more action to enhance more physical and mental personality expressed which in turn shows that legolas is swift whilst Gandalf is defiant. The music by Howard shore is always the thing that lets you know you have entered into middle earth with its iconic, powerful and medieval themed that always makes you just want to stand up and say "fuck yeah that's awesome". One thing that was improved from the last movie was saruman's character who conjures up a massive army of ura Kai to destroy rohan as his voice echoes with defiance and power to emphasise his evil and dominance as the main antagonist of the second movie. The Two Towers is a great follow to the fellowship of the ring and is filled with so much a lord of the rings fan could want; massive battles, spectacular landscapes and cool characters to cheer and fear. 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare to be blown away...again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 'Lord of the Rings' was a welcome return of epic fantasy for the big screen. There hadn't been so many of these involving dragons and wizards in the 90s. It was both a critical and financial success, so the next chapter had much to live up to. This was not just because it was following a great film, but also it continues from where it ended. The original cast and crew returned, plus a few new additions, and they didn't disappoint.Pros: Excellent performances. Steady direction. Quite well written. Powerful score. Impressive effects. Nice costume and set design. Plenty of great epic battle scenes. Moves at a good pace for the most part.Cons: Drags in the middle a bit.Final thoughts: Sequels usually let us down, but there are exceptions. With this group of people, how could you go wrong? 'The Two Towers' is every bit as good as it's predecessor, even better in some instances. The stakes are raised a bit and the characters are in more dire situations. I don't think we could have asked for a better Christmas present.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' continues right after the Fellowship has been broken; Frodo and Sam continue on with their journey into Mordor. Along the way, they come across a creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis), who believes that they stole "his precious". So, he guides Frodo and Sam up to Mordor.Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go off to Rohan and reunite with Gandalf, who is now Gandalf the White after defeating the Balrog into the abyss (best opening sequence ever), and they all make allies with some people of Rohan - like Théoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan ? as they prepare to fight in the Battle of Helm's Deep (which is praised as one of the best battle scenes in movie history, and I agree), while Merry and Pippin were taken by the orcs and make allies with a few tree creatures who are known as Ents, who plan to attack Isengard.Featuring the same terrific performances, the same wonderful direction by Jackson, and the same sensational action what made 'Fellowship' brilliant, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is as amazing as 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. This movie features probably the best use of motion-capture animation to ever be put on film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete. The heart of the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is time, enough time to admire everything done in this movie.All aspects of the story are fully developed. The dialogs are just the essence of the whole saga. The whole casting at their best performance.And then, right after each meaningful punch line, there's time to gaze the vast landscapes and feel the most remarkable music. All this perfectly orchestrates moments of transcendence and self realization on its pace.Among the three movies this is by far the more uplifting and complete. Although there's no coming or going without "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Return of the King", anyone can enjoy this epic and extraordinary work and relate to it as one's own life heroic journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The saga continues with even more richness and complexity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" continues J.R.R. Tolkien's epic as interpreted by Peter Jackson, and though it lacks the same degree of suspense as "The Fellowship of the Ring," it delivers when it matters in the first culminating battle sequence of the series.In "The Two Towers," the Fellowship has been disbanded following the death of Boromir (Sean Bean). Having bent the great wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) toward his will, Sauron now has armies in both Mordor and at Isengard (the two towers). Saruman's army of Uruk Hai have turned their attention to the kingdom of Rohan, where Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) venture. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) set out for Mordor on their own, though they quickly find themselves with another companion, the creature Gollum, who lusts after the Ring that once was his.The script for this middle installment involves a lot of setup and building toward the climax: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Given the rich texture and detail of Jackson's Middle Earth, we are swept up and intrigued by the new characters and locations rather than bogged down by them. The subplot of the catatonic King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and the treacherous Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) makes for great theater though it complicates matters, as does all the focus on Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who becomes quite fond of Aragorn despite knowing his heart belongs to another.With the Fellowship divided, the narrative must bounce around and entire characters become left out for what seem like hours. The one weak limb of the story that we come back to time and time again that really sticks out in a negative way is the subplot with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been rescued from a band of Uruk Hai by the great Treebeard, leader of the Ents. The film cuts back numerous times to the two hobbits riding on Treebeard's back as he slowly delivers exposition and back story, and the scenes are few and far between, so they really make the length of the film stand out in a negative way.All is cured, however, at Helm's Deep. This is the major action payoff we've been waiting for since the opening prologue in "Fellowship," the first major arrival point in the series, one that the script foreshadows hours before the battle begins. The people of Rohan have retreated to their refuge hoping that the fortress's high walls will allow their few hundred to pull off a miracle against the thousands of Uruk Hai. It's a classic Greek mythology setup and the payoff makes Helm's Deep the most rewarding sequence in the series thus far.But what makes "Two Towers" great is not just the spectacle in the end; we also get even deeper into our cast of characters. The film really explores the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and their likely ill-fated romance. Although they're mostly comic relief, we become closer with Gimli and Legolas through greater use of humorous dialogue.The acting standouts of the film, however, are once again Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White, given a renewed life for the purpose of saving Middle Earth, and Andy Serkis as the motion-captured schizophrenic creature, Gollum/Smeagol. McKellen continues to draw so much attention to his character and the 100 percent pure gravitas he brings to the role cannot be over-appreciated. Adorned in white and given greater power this time around, he literally sparkles.Gollum is a curious character who carves out a pivotal role in the series in just a few hours after hints at his relationship with the Ring. The character's voice and mannerisms could drive a viewer insane, but he's such a technological breakthrough and Serkis gives the pitiable and ugly thing legitimate complexity. Whether Frodo and Sam can trust him becomes a huge piece of this movie, and ultimately it becomes about whether or not we trust him. Frodo believes that Gollum is capable of doing the right thing and that he's their only chance to make it to Mordor, whereas Sam is ever the skeptic. This thread of doubt runs through the entire Frodo- Sam-Gollum subplot. In the end, once again the script uses such moving dialogue delivered by actors so fiercely committed to their characters' emotions to really cap off "The Two Towers" in a way that will have you forgetting how long it took to get to this point and eagerly awaiting the final chapter. Sam's speech to Frodo in the end is nothing short of inspiring, capturing where the narrative is from an emotional and thematic standpoint. All the characters by the end of "Two Towers" have passed the point of no return; they've stared down certain annihilation and come to the conclusion that they are too far committed to their responsibilities to not be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. The notion that the "storm is coming" foreshadows the Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's really about what lies beyond. Hope is the unspoken theme in play ? they all have to believe in it.Bridging the first and last chapters makes "Two Towers" the weakest of the series, but it's also among the most memorable for its stirring conclusion and rousing segue into "The Return of the King." Having had first exposure to this incredible cinematic vision for Middle Earth, it can be easy to forget the incredible production value, but that has to be noted and assures this second "Lord of the Rings" film a certain baseline of absolute excellence.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Corrects most of the mistakes the first movie made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched "The Fellowship of The Ring",the first entry in the LOTR trilogy,I thought it was a very good adventure movie,but there were two flaws that kept me from rating it 10/10-the characters didn't have the amount of development I expected(from a 3 hour movie) and some of the fight scenes seemed kind of over the top and abused slow motion way too much .Although these flaws weren't that major,they did kinda spoiled the experience for me."The Two Towers" corrects these flaws and manages to create an almost perfect epic.The characters feel as if they got the development they needed.I especially liked the new character the movie introduced to us- Gollum. He was,in my opinion, a very complex and well thought out character and from now on-my favorite character in the franchise(before that it was Gimli).The fight scenes are also done better,than in the previous film.Most of them are battles of epic proportions,rather then just the fellowship fighting a larger group as it was in the previous film.They still abuse slow motion a little too much,though,and they actually use the Wilhelm scream at one point.Overall,"The Two Towers" is a worthy sequel,that even manages to surpass it's precursor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle Earth is back and is as PERFECT as it has always been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' marked the beginning of a new era of film making. The first film was made with such care and love for J.R.R Tolkien's work and many people were unsure if 'The Two Towers' would be as good. One word answers everyone's doubts: YESThis is still a legendary film, although I prefer the first and third a little more than 'The Two Towers' but by no means was this a bad film. The film may seem like it dragged on in certain situations but the film came off in style. J.R.R Tolkien's two biggest strengths with the Vol 3 and 4 of his Lord of the Rings novel, or 'The Two Towers' novel were the way that Gollum was introduced and everything about Rohan. This film caps it off in amazing style. Gollum was brought to the big screen in the most amazing way possible. It was so well done. Edoras and everything about Rohan was superbly filmed and I loved the addition of Grima Wormtongue into this film. He, much like Saruman, is filled with pure hate for the good guys. However, both the acting by EVERY single cast member was brilliant. Sir Ian McKellen was back, and he ABSOLUTELY NAILED the role of Gandalf the White. Legendary actor Sir Christopher Lee also nails the role of Saruman, whilst Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis and pretty much every actor puts out such a powerful performance. The special effects and the cinematography was superb. The way they showed several places such as mountains and Mordor with descending or ascending shots was superb. The special effects are beyond amazing! The score for the film is untouched. Howard Shore ABSOLUTELY KICKS-ASS with his music. Many may say that John Williams or Hans Zimmer would've been better, but I disagree. Howard Shore was able to pull you right into Middle-Earth and the Elvish-type soundtracks were amazing. The film did choose to go through different paths from the book but the film was purely amazing! One of the best scenes in this film were Gandalf releasing Theoden and the entire build up to the Battle of Helm's Deep. It was so intense and full of drama. ****FULL SPOILER DETAIL**** -The Battle for Helm's Deep- Every single thing about the Battle of Helm's Deep was awesome. I loved how they should some awesome moments for all three characters and the whole idea of 'seeing higher kill count' was awesome. The fact that the elves joined the battle and that they all die is extremely sad. Legolas' badass moments where he skateboards the shield and shoots down the ladder holder were awesome. I liked the entire Dwarf-tossing idea. The end of the battle where Gandalf and the Rohirrim arrive is done so well and seeing the Uruk-hai finally flee was brilliant-Gollum- Gollum is one of the greatest motion picture history characters. From the very moment you see him in the films, Gollum casts such a strangely awesome feeling to you. Andy Serkis absolutely kills at being Gollum! The way it ended with Gollum finally betraying the Hobbits once more was brilliant***end of spoilers***Definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!... (again)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. It's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Films of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films are, quite frankly, the greatest films of all-time. Nothing has surpassed them, and I do not suspect anything soon will. The world it is set in is so rich, so unique, and so beautiful that you will often find yourself marveling at the sheer wonder of it all. The set and the locations are incredible, and absolutely gorgeous. The characters and writing are superb, and they are translated to screen wonderfully. They are all exactly how I imagined them while reading the books. The special effects are the best I have ever seen. The action scenes are amazing, but the films does incredible even when it is just people talking. Overall, they are the greatest films I have ever seen, and anyone who has yet to watch them needs to do so immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even when this trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson isn't entirely faithful to the books in which it was inspired, I think that it does capture the essence of the monumental epic written by Tolkien, managing to be solemn and magnificent, but keeping all the exciting fun from the original story.All the elements that made the original book a timeless work in the history of literature are present in three movies, from the epic background to the most subtle subtext elements, a quality that makes this trilogy of movies being something more complex and significant than any other fantasy movie that I had seen before in my life.The production values are superb, being able to recreate all the grandeur of the Middle Earth. Every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison, having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. All the scenes are wonderfully directed, showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: The music, the performances, the visual effects?Every single elements fits perfectly, creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books.While "The Fellowship of the Ring" serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story, "The Two Towers" works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters, as they struggle against their personal conflicts. Finally, "The Return of the King" closes the story in a more than satisfying way, with a moving resolution that is happy, sad and nostalgic at the same time.Those three films will always have a very special meaning for me, being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch, but also, a unique cinematic experience that, at least in my opinion, couldn't be matched.Personally, I consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema.10/10 (I would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if I could.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was still in high-school and first LOTR:FOTR came out. I watched posters all over the place, on the bus stop, in subways and everywhere. I went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. The only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. Then, one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on Kazza (if people may know what Kazza was at that time). AFter few hour the download was complete. So i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen (600*400). After more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. I could not believe what i saw. I was a spectacle of life. A sheer journey to the land of fantasy, warriors, and elves ( I kind of fell in love with Arwen at that time). Then i realized that some how the end was not complete. It stuck in my mind for few days, then started surfing the web again. Eventually, i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. And after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. The movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. I hope The hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's OK. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic awesome film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely is a sequel better than the original. But for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, that is definitely the case. It surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring in every way. More elaborate battle sequences, and more mythic monsters. But I am not in any way saying The Fellowship of the Ring was not a fun movie, because it is, I just think The Two Towers is a little better. It is more action packed and some characters that are seen briefly in the first movie now have a bigger role in this one. The character of gollum was an amazing addition to the series. And the actor who played him really was just outstanding. He gives the character a very good sense of realness and believability. The best movie of 2002. This movie is also not one to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reaches the same emotional level as TFOTR and even surpasses it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After doing a successful job in bringing the details and imagination of J.R.R Tolkien to life in The Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson fails to disappoint us in bringing the second installment to life and it's a big hit it has the same emotional level/depth as The Fellowship of the Ring and even surpasses it.The cast are as compelling as ever, but I think Andy Serkis steals the show for his terrific performance as the creepy and realistic Gollum, the creature who has been driven by the ring for a few years until Bilbo Baggins found it and is now following Sam and Frodo into Mordor to destroy the one ring. It's great to see that he won an award for best supporting actor.Aside from the cast, the story from the second entry is faithful like the previous installment was with emotional moments including the scene where Elrond tells Arwem her future and the fate of Aragorn when she's married to him, astounding action sequences including Helm's Deep, beautiful visuals including Isengard, the same mountain that Gandalf battled the Balrog (It's great to see Gandalf surviving his fall and he explains how he killed the Balrog) along with the same detailed themes as TFOTR's, lovely CGI effects, the powerfully emotional music score from Howard Shore and a great ending where the battle of Helm's Deep ended along with the battle of Isengard.The Two Towers is another entry that captures the same emotional depth and level of The Fellowship of the Ring, making it a huge hit back in 2002 and would always be recommended to not only to fans of JRR Tolkien, but to children and adults young and old.10/10</fullReview>

I don't get too defensive about Tolkien, but I do hate how Treebeard gets turned into a moron. Gimli's attempts at comedy are still terrible, and let's not forget about Surfin' Legolas and Indestructible Aragorn. However, this one endures better than the first. Switching between the multiple plot threads cuts down on the tedium, and excitement level is way up. You've got the introduction of Gollum as a real character, the development of the Frodo/Sam dynamic, and despite their dumbing down, the Ents are way friggin' cool. The most fun and probably the best-paced part of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thrilling Film Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film in Peter Jackson's series of screen adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. This fantasy film directed by Jackson is based on the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the second film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and concluding with The Return of the King.Frodo,who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum, a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard, a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman have robbed King Theoden of his rule. The King's niece Éowyn believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue, and their minions. Éowyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen. Gandalf offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death.The second chapter of Peter Jackson's seminal epic differs from the first in narrative and tone, there are more battle scenes and the mood is darker.But nevertheless,it was a wonderfully entertaining piece of filmmaking, filled with as much spectacle and wonder as any motion picture as compared to the first movie.It was outstanding but has very violent battle scenes.But still,what's remarkable is how immediately, after a full year, The Two Towers seizes your attention, and how urgently it holds you through three seamless, action-packed hours with a conclusion that makes you excited for the next film in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic movie that will leave you hungry for the third and final installment!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to apologize. I know I was supposed to make this review a day after the first one's but I got caught up with other stuff (including finals, which I am unfortunately still enduring :/). So here it goes...This film is nothing short of EPIC!!! ANY adjective used to describe this has to come from ''epic''. The fight scenes, the emotional ones, the beautiful landscapes, the timeless characters, the humor... EVERYTHING!!! LOTR: The Two Towers is split into three parts- The adventures of the three groups of the now separated Fellowship (after Boromir's epic death in FOTR: Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli; Pippin and Merry; and Sam and Frodo. Aragorn and the other two are searching for Merry and Pippin who were taken away from them when they were captured by Orcs in the first film. Sam and Frodo, of course, are traveling towards Mordor to destroy the evil One Ring. And now they are accompanied by the creature Gollum, who has pledged to take them to the Black Gate of Mordor.That's technically it for the premise. Telling you anymore would be spoiling the movie for you. And, believe me, there are some twists and turns in the movie's great plot.The characters in this movie are deeply developed. They have deep and rick personalities; some gentle, some fierce and some purely evil. Nonetheless, even the villains are likable do to the incredible amount of care given to the character's development.The film stays true to the book while making some minor changes for the best, although the heart and soul of the book is left intact. The character's personality are also true to the book's intentions.The special effects in Two Towers are AWESOMEEEE!!! The battle of Gandalf and the Balrog at the beginning as they are falling down the Bridge is greatly handled and has some impressive effects. The color palette is less varied as the environments are grimmer than the first film. The Battle of Helm's deep is awesome too in the film's finale. The epic scale given to it is great.The acting in this one is top-notch, which special nods given to Sean Astin and Ian Mckellen. Miranda Otto also gives a stellar performance as the grief-ridden Eowyn, who falls in love with Aragorn.The sound effects are cool. Orcs growl epically, swords clash which a ''clang!!'' and arrows speed across the landscapes to eventually land in another person's helmet which a metal clinking sound or flesh tearing when it hits bare flesh. You'll even laugh when Aragorn kicks the Orc helmet in the pyre at the beginning. The reason he screams so realistically is because he broke his toes on the helmet when he kicked it in real life. (LOL!!!). The soundtrack is moody and greatly integrated into the movie's scenes.All in all, excellent movie. Epic fights, beautiful special effects, great soundtrack, top-notch acting and true attention to the book combine to make a great movie. You'll enjoy this one greatly if you love the books, or are simply looking for a great fantasy-action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOTR as a genre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the amazing feat that was The Fellowship and the fact that Return of the King has won the most awards in the trilogy, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers still takes the cake was the best LOTR movie. Although the standards for the movie were already set by J. R. Tolkien, Jackson's direction fulfills (and even surpasses at some points) all expectations of the LOTR fantasy world through the settings, the cast, and special effects.The fairytale-like settings Jackson achieved by shooting on location in New Zealand do total and complete justice to their counterparts in the books. Rivendell and Hobbiton were absolutely gorgeous as well as accurate, and both are entirely fantastical. Along with the scenery, the special effects were spectacular throughout the entire film. The actors had to be digitally enhanced so the hobbits and dwarfs looked the size they were described in the book. In some scenes were special effects or stunt doubles may have been used, Orlando Bloom's Legolas shines as a rugged elf prince when he performs his own stunts (most notable in the scene where he swings himself up into a horse's saddle during the Warg battle and the scene at the battle of Helm's Deep where he surfs down the stairs on his shield. Jackson went above and beyond fantasy genre standards in his creation of the Two towers. The film continues and even gives further insight into the myths and fairy tales of elves, spirits, dark forces, and the strength of man that is prevalent in every myth. It follows the traditional Hero's Journey arc, and follows it beautifully. It pioneered many filmic techniques on a massive scale was accurate in every detail. Overall, the film stands out on an epic masterpiece and a tribute to the fantasy genre as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The war of the ring begins to heat up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not that Tolkien is original in his stories, he is not, but rather it is the way that he uses his knowledge of European literature to create such a colourful and engaging world. His characters are not shallow, nor is he strictly black and white in his characters either. Granted, there is absolutely nothing good about Sauron, but his better characters are not necessarily pure either. In this regard I think of Gandalf. He is the closest character to what one would consider a good guy in his story, but instead of calling him good, I would say that he is incredibly wise. However it is not that Gandalf is immune from corruption, it is just that he is wise enough to avoid it.Now, Gandalf is what is called an Istari. He is one of an order of magicians who were sent by the Valar to Middle Earth to combat Sauron. The Valar chose not to physically come to Middle Earth for fear than any war against Sauron would leave the Middle Earth a desolate wasteland, so instead they sent agents in the form of the Istari. The two major ones are Gandalf and Saruman. Now, it appears at first that Saruman is a 'good guy' but it ends up becoming very clear that he has been corrupted by Sauron and has switched sides. In this part of the story Saruman is the main protagonist as he raises his army of orcs to destroy the land of Rohan. However it should be clear that if Saruman is not beyond corruption then neither is Gandalf.When we are introduced to Theodren, King of Rohan, he is gripped with a madness and is the puppet being manipulated by Worntongue. Now, Wormtongue is dealt with quickly, but it is interesting how Tolkien's characters show mercy. While Wormtongue, a traitor allied with Saruman, deserves death, Gandalf causes them to hold back their wrath and let him flee. In that sense he is shown mercy, and this mercy is indicated because to act on instinct and give Wormtongue what he deserves is to sink down to his level.The action in this book evolves around Frodo and Sam attempting to make their way to Morder, and the others defending themselves against Saruman. The idea is that Sauron's forces are to attack the lands of men (Gondor and Rohan) from the east while Saruman attacks from the west. Sauron's army is dealt with later and the main focus of this book is the battle against Saruman. However Saruman is not killed. While Pippin and Merry trick the Ents into going to war against Saruman, Saruman is not necessarily defeated (and we discover that at the end of the third book).I want to finish this section off exploring another of the themes that runs through these books and that is of friendship. We see the theme of friendship most clearly with Frodo and Sam. While Frodo is innocent, Sam is loyal. He refuses, point blank, to let Frodo go off by himself. Now this friendship is stretched at times, but Sam never gives up. He is determined to stand by Frodo until the end, even if it means that both of them die.Another element of mercy that is seen in these books is in relation to Gollum. I will say more on Gollum in the next section as he is a very important character in the story. However, he is also a very pathetic and pitiful character, and while he does things deserving of death, we are reminded that he is not killed because the character's pity him. It is in this that Frodo shows friendship to him, even though he is not deserving of friendship, and is also very traitorous, but more on that later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't like Dead Man's Chest, this is serious entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I was scared that the movie will go down after Fellowship's great success. I felt the same before watching Aliens, Bourne 2, Pirates of the Caribbean 2, etc. But, they made it...The first part only had a single story line. This time there are many things happening at once. In this part, the tension is raised. More characters are introduced who will play crucial roles in the next part. The feeling of hope, despair and absence of lost ones was captured very beautifully in this movie as though there is a continuous flow of energy. This movie enhances these feelings and we get attached to the characters. This movie is also rich in imagery. Each and every character is given equal importance, not just Frodo and Sam, as they too are a part of this war. This movie is also well-known for Gollum: the double-minded creature who is stuck in a to-be-or-not-to-be state. He is the character who does poetic justice to the book and keeps the thrill never-ending.But with Gollum, we have the prowess of Saruman and the evil gaze of Sauron. These two stand tall on their towers (Hence the title) creating a massive army which would result in explosive endings in the current and next installment. Nevertheless, Two towers is better, bigger and more stronger. I promise, you will be left spellbound...10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I said this before but I highly recommend anyone to watch the extended edition for this. It was a real treat seeing this in theater, but seeing the extended edition you can't help but appreciate this film even more. The first film in this trilogy was mesmerizing, and for the most part this movie is mesmerizing as well with it's amazing action set pieces and design but just not as much as the first film. And although it's engrossing I didn't feel the magical experience that I had with the first movie. But that still isn't to say this movie is any less, this film really leaves a mark in cinema and is a memorable movie that will stick with the audience for a long period of time. The first movie in this trilogy is inspirational in many ways but this film is inspirational as well with it's fantasy, magic and action. It will inspire countless movies and especially when it comes to video games. The story is superb although the whole movie leads up to a huge battle at Helm's Deep. The atmosphere is more dark and blue this time which adds a lot to the feel of this film. And I couldn't help myself but care about the cause for the big battle to come and the actual main party that is fighting against Sauron's army. Yes, there are some one liners in this but those one liners stands out in a good way and gets the emotions going and kept me pumped up for whats to come. The speech during battles was actually one of them and it works. The characters in this with the circumstances made honor and virtue really stand out while some characters must fight through temptations. To be honest I liked Tolkien's book this movie is adapted from but found it a bit dry so I didn't really see that big of a problem when Jackson decided to spice things up a bit while staying true to the main story at hand. Even if few great parts of the book is different in the movie, the movie makes up for it for the most part. Although a lot of Tolkien fans might disagree with this, but it's just my opinion. This movie wasn't as enthralling or magical as "Fellowship" but it holds it's rightful place in this trilogy and is a great film. Just wasn't enthralling as it's predecessor which was a masterpiece but this one comes pretty close. Some may say this movie isn't well edited but like I said before you have to watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this movie, it just has those key scenes including battle sequences that is missing from it theater release. Anyways this is a awesome second part of the trilogy that should not be missed although it's probably not good as "Fellowship".8.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe that a sequel can be that good. Even I felt that it was slightly better than the earlier one. The story concluded from the previous part and it have more wars going on which is a treat with marvelous CG effects. This time the pace was faster than the Fellowship of The Ring. The same efforts from Peter Jackson are clearly visible. Again everyone has done a great job in their respective acts. I could easily watch the extended version without getting bored. The character of Gollum is quite interestingly made fit in the story. The battle of Isengard is what this one is wholly about. Its quite a lengthy war but its one of the jaw-dropper. Overall I think again every technical aspect touched almost perfection. Although I feel this one was better a little still I don't feel like giving it a perfect 10. Again a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy, Director Peter Jackson moves on to the second film. The Two Towers is excellent, a delight to watch. Andy Serkis's performance added with the CGI make Gollum, a convincing critter, one of the highlights of the film. The battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works! The story follows Frodo and Sam, still on their way to Mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey. Meanwhile Aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil. Arresting, epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is just as good as the first. It has all the right ingredients - great actors, brilliant characters and bucket loads of action - to make it one of the best films ever made. Viggo Mortensen once again makes an amazing Aragorn, with a huge natural authority that translates brilliantly into the film. Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood and John Rhys-Davies are also excellent as Legolas Greenleaf, Frodo Baggins and Gimli respectively. The special effects and computer generated scenes remain just as good as in the first film, and the use of models to create difficult scenes works absolutely incredibly. I would giver this film a definite ten out of ten - I just can't fault it. A must-watch film for everyone, no matter what your tastes in film are.</fullReview>

I was very impressed with the special effects, the way the handled all the different scenes. The different real life locations they used, the drama they went through to film it, the pains LITERATELY, and so on.The plot was okay, I'd still say the first was better in that regard as the first introduced everyone, the second sort of went away from the original plans that the characters were going to go through, however the battle scenes, as well as all of the other scenes in the movie, were well done.Rated 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that everyone is divided on LOTR The Two Towers, nearly half of all people think this is the best of the trilogy and the other half think that it is the worst. Well in my opinion it isn't the worst, rather the least great, since all three movies are masterpieces of cinema. The only thing that makes it less great is that occasionally it feels if it is trying to prepare for TROTK rather than be it's own great film, but those moments a far and few in fact unless your very critical you won't even care. Aside from that the acting, special effects, and overall story are some of the best ever put on the big screen.</fullReview>

Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film, but also the story was magical, captivating and unforgettable, with great characters, excellent performances and beautiful music.This was one of the most incredible films ever made, I think those three "Lord of the Rings" flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema, and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was "Avatar" from James Cameron."The Two Towers" is the excellent sequel of this great trilogy, and shares all the good elements of the previous film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling. It was also darker than the original film, but that was good.This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie delights me each and every time when i see it and the reason for that is that this movies gives importance to the other wonderful creations of nature and also gives equality to each and every kind of humans on this planet, be it the short pygmy type people or the royal king type and last but not the least, the humans.but what fascinates me more is that this this movies shows us the importance of the existence of the other forms of life such as trees. think of the times when you have cared or even gave a thought about the trees, the creation of nature upon which we are entirely dependent upon for our very own existence for each and every second of our life. we seldom think about these things in our fast pace of life and neither do we seem to give importance to it.we admire the beauty of the nature only when we need a break from our daily routine ad then again get back do our routine during which we pollute this nature of ours in each and every possible way.we pollute the environment even when we are going to a temple or church or any damn religious place just to seek a blissful future with the purest air to breath even though we are causing a heavy pollution on our way to that religious place.so i recommend to watch out this movie whenever possible because it not just teaches us to fight against the injustice and the evil in this society of ours but rather it also teaches us to to treat each and every creation equal without neglecting or causing harm to other species of this exotic planet on which we live because this is the only way to make this world a better place.the best time to plant a tree was twenty years before, the second best time is now and always remember that "THE DIFFERENCE YOU MAKE WILL BE GREAT, YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT ITS THERE, ITS ALWAYS THERE".HAVE A GREAT DAY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second movie in the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is a fantasy/action movie about one hobbit and the continuation of his quest to destroy the all-powerful ring to save mankind, hobbits, and other creatures alike. Saruman, played by Christopher Lee, is building his army of orcs to destroy mankind under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and anyone who fights with them. He has an eye that can see the ring that Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, carries around his neck. The ring is drawn to the eye, and the burden of carrying it gets harder and harder for Frodo, as he and Sam, another hobbit played by Sean Austin, make their way to Mordor. In the meantime, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, and his companions continue on to Rohan, to warn them of Saruman's army and intentions. The King Théoden, after being released from a spell, has his people flee to the walls of Helms Deep for safety from the orc army. As they prepare any man or child that can bear arms to fight, Saruman's army approaches Helms Deep. The massive army is too much for the untrained forces of Rohan, and the orc army blows a hole in the supposedly indestructible wall. The women and children flee into the caves, as the remaining forces try and fight off the orcs. When there is only a small group left to fight, Gandalf the White and his forces he recruited come over the hilltop at sunrise to take the orcs by surprise and end the battle.This film is full of exciting battle scenes, and ones full of emotional turmoil as Frodo fights the urge to give up the burden of the ring, as the eye feels its presence. Another movie that resembles the Lord of the Rings is the Harry Potter series. In both story lines, it is basically good versus evil, with wizards and creatures in a fantasy world, but ultimately run by humans. Both Harry Potter and Frodo are relied upon to carry a burden, while having companions to help along the way. I think the director, Peter Jackson, did a great job using dark lighting in the nighttime battle scene, and just about any time an evil character was in shot. It brought a kind of eeriness to the scenes and brought the evil persona's to life. The angles were well used also, such as in the battle scenes which showcases each character in quick shots, one after another, so as to keep up with the fighting. All in all, the movie tells quite a bit of story with detail and awesome visuals, which keep up with each character's story on the ultimate quest to destroy the ring and defeat Sauron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OMG, this next part of the trilogy blown me away once again. Peter Jackson has created a film called Lord of the rings: the two towers and it is as good or even better than the first. If i compare these to the books so far, the first two has overdone it ten fold. There are absolutely great visuals, acting is still pretty good, and really entertained the crowd with a stunning cheer. There is a character you meet called gollum and he sets off with a lot of laughs and delight. The main hobbits were OK in my opinion. Sam was brilliant and I really felt for him, but Frodo was kinda a shame. He was fine in the first, but i found he was kinda idk, a wimp. be sure to ignore how he was kinda bad as the movie was great. This one kinda had an ending so it knocks that complaint out of the park. This film is magnificent, check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continues the trilogy with VERY long action scene...but with a BANG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not completely easy to sit through a 3 hour movie, with at least one-fourth being action scenes. But with Peter Jackson's signature touch it works magnetically. It's visually intoxicating, there are some moments where you're pushed back in your seat gawking at the screen trying to get the word "How?" between you lips. It's the second chapter from the legendary trilogy novel, and it's a magically entry in the landmark series in film history. Though it's a filler between "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Return of the King", it stands by itself as a iconic film. Like I've said before, you'll be wowed by what you see. Dazzling visuals here--especially Gollum. The sets are unbelievingly rich and detailed. The cinematography is so beautiful, the photography looks like it could be featured in an art museum. The costumes are wonderful, as they were in the first film. Special effects had never been put to better use anywhere else, than here. Oh my goodness are the only words you'll be thinking. It's incredible what happens here whether it's computer generated or not...it's believable. It's worth seeing for that reason alone. Ian McKellen's well-known role of Gandalf is minimized from the Fellowship, but McKellen does what he can with what's given to him, as usual. Besides, it'd be hard to top his original portrayal. It's one of the best the cinema has ever had. Gandalf's fate from the mysterious and misleading disappearance from the first opens the film, and it's a great move to remind the audience what happened in the original. To catch up so that they can begin the next part of what seems like the never ending journey. He also his a great entrance to the film itself after his intro. There's a great cast effort here. Andy Serkis, who maybe had 60 seconds of time in The Fellowship delivers a knockout performance here. Viggo Mortensen also shines here. The rest of the cast is also very good. You become emotionally attached to the great love story of Aragon and Arwen. There part of the film is one of the many highlights. The Two Towers contains intense and exciting editing. It's masterful and would've been perfect if some of the final battle could've been cut. We didn't really need a half hour battle scene, in my opinion. The only flaw, I'd say, is that scene. It's way too long, which makes the already lengthly film longer. Only flaw in a near perfect sequel. It ends on a fantastic and suspenseful note from first a monologue from Sam, then a shorter monologue from Gollum. Darker and scarier than the first, but all so visionary, it won't disappoint fans. Jackson's directing is continued with great class for the most part. Essentially, there are three story lines in this chapter because all the Fellowship has divided and split up, but the transitions are smooth and well-done, creating a marvelous adventure; 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are some of the underlining things in the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Opening scene opens up with mountains and a faint voice yelling, if you have watched the first movie you realize that the voice is Gandalf. Gandalf is fighting the balrog from Mordor. He saved the rest of the fellowship in the first movie, and we were all left hanging wondering what happened to Gandalf? Not until later on in the movie do you realize what exactly becomes of Gandalf. Gandalf kills the balrog from Mordor, dies, and then comes back to life in white robes. He is now powerful enough to face Saruman and better help the fellowship.J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Ring series. Which then became the movie trilogy, but the movies did a very good job of portraying the books. Tolkien wrote the books with a lot of hidden meaning, a lot of... Christian hidden meaning. Isn't it peculiar how Gandalf and Christ both did similar things? If you believe the stories of Christ, you will notice that Gandalf died saving the Fellowship and similarly Christ died to save mankind. Gandalf came back to life, he also came back white and more powerful. Christ, according to the Bible, died then came back to life. He came back pure and ready to visit God the Father in heaven. Both of them died to save the lives of those who they cared for.I always find it interesting how movies and books can portray so much more than the story line itself. In the Lord of the Ring series there are many lessons to learn apart from just watching a great story. One of those lessons is the power of friendship. Gimli, and Legolas are races that hate each other because of their past, and their differences. While they are chasing the uruk-hai they run into some riders of Rohan. The riders surrounded the group, and the first thing out of Gimli's mouth was a rude gesture to the horse master Eomer. In return Eomer made fun of Gimli's height, and told him he would cut off his head. Legolas pulled out and arrow, strung it, and pointed it at the man's head. He told the man he would die "before his stroke fell." The world is full of different races and different cultures. I think that these two are a good example of how people can overcome their differences in order to get along with one another. In America I know that there is still a big problem with racism. People from different countries might annoy other people. Tourists can be annoying. If people would take the time to talk and get to know the people they have problems with, then maybe one will find out that they are not that bad.At the Battle of Helm's Deep, Gimli told Legolas that he never thought he would die in the company of elves. Legolas responded, well how about beside a friend. In the book, after the battle the two of them explored the crystal caves that were at Helm's deep. They both decided to travel together back to visit the caves when the war was over. A friendship out of a war is a bond that is very hard to sever.Eomer's story is one that we can look at for a good lesson on perseverance. He was banished from the kingdom by Grima Wormtongue, who was providing a way for Saruman to control the King. In spite of this he was determined to rid the King's land of the uruk-hai and orcs that came from Saruman.At the end, when the king was back to his normal self, he needed help. The king desperately rode out on horses to try to buy the women and children time to escape in the caves. While in the middle of thousands of uruk-hai Eomer ran down the slope with hundreds of riders to save the king and win the battle. Eomer persevered to do what he knew was right. He didn't second guess his intuition that he needed to protect those who he loved.There are many things we can learn from the LOTR trilogy. The theology and lessons we can bring to attention from the movies and books are numerous. I just hope this gave you a taste of some of the things you can pull from the videos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made 2nd edition in the Lord of the Rings trilogy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/22/2009 ? 7 out of 10 (Dir-Peter Jackson): Well made 2nd edition in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is perfect in it's technical rendering of the middle Earth world. The characters also have plenty for the viewer to hold onto in this epic battle of good against evil. In this episode, Frodo and Sam are still seeking Moldor to destroy the ring and are following Gollum, played by Andy Serkis with some digital help. There are a couple of side stories as we follow a couple of Hobbits with their tree friends, a couple other members of the fellowship as they try to help Gondor fight off their enemies, and the rising of the wizard of Gondorf. All of the stories follow the same theme of good versus evil and they flow together well despite their complexity. Another amazing technical achievement by director Peter Jackson with an excellent story that doesn't fade throughout the movie. I'm looking forward to watching the final film and will probably weep when it's over because the characters stuck with me so much. This trilogy is up there with the Star Wars films in it's majesty and spectacle and possibly surpasses them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I watched the extended cut) The middle part of the Lord of the Rings -trilogy, The Two Towers (2002) managed to balance nicely between the intimate character driven moments of the first film and the massive (and long) battle sequences and "epic" atmosphere of the third film. The film also added a well crafted CGI-character to that mix, along with a wonderfully bleak story and a great soundtrack. The result was that Two Towers is somewhat the highlight of the trilogy; not bouncing so much around from scene to scene as the first or the third film and rid of the boring story moments of the The Return of the King (2003).The fellowship has broken and the film follows the three somewhat separate story lines of the remaining characters of the Fellowship of the Ring (2001), while adding new ones from left and right. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) are again the strong points of the cast, Bernard Hill (Theoden) also a positive surprise. Andy Serkis does great work along with the effects team at bringing "real" life and emotion to the CGI -character of Gollum.The action scenes are fun to sit through, the drama keeps you interested and the definite battle scene is well build-up from the first words of warning to the last swings of swords and whatnots &#x2013; the film's good fantasy entertainment. Like the other films of the trilogy, it lacks the deeper and more"humane" approach of the books the films are based on, concentrating more on the "heavy on drama and action" -scenes but I understand the thought process behind that decision. I'm not so much of a fan of the books, myself so that's not a "big question" for me.Peter Jackson (the director) managed to keep the multiple and branching story lines well in place, the film also looks great and contains a great otherworldly atmosphere throughout. It has some issues (I didn't find all the story lines interesting enough, the CGI in places is pretty awful in comparison to the best the film can offer, runs for a tad too long) but is a great movie experience to sit through. 3/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 2 in the Epic Trilogy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a couple of days since the Fellowship broke up into 3 groups. Merry and Pippin have been taken by Ors and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to help find them. Frodo and Sam continue their journey closer to Mordor. You are introduced to new characters, like Grima Wormtongue, Eomer, Eowyn, King Theoden, Gollum, Treebeard, and a lot more. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find that Gandalf is still alive. Frodo and Sam seek help from Gollum on getting to Mordor. Saruman sends his Orcs to Rohan, so the people flee to Helm's Deep where a huge battle takes place. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken by Boromir's brother; Faramir who wants to take the ring to Gondor. If you love battles, fantasies, and epics, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as successful as the other two 'Rings' films but still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Two Towers", the second film in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, picks up with Frodo &amp; Sam trekking towards Mordor while Aragorn, Gimli &amp; Legolas set off to rescue Merry &amp; Pippin. It is in this film that we meet Gollum and Treebeard, among other characters.As in the case of the first film, the acting here is pretty solid but not really worth remarking upon. Almost everyone from the first film is back, along with a few new faces like Brad Dourif &amp; Miranda Otto.Director Peter Jackson is still at the helm, though he didn't manage to nab a Best Director Oscar nomination as he did for the other two films. However, the film did win for Visual Effects once again, no doubt on the strength of the climactic confrontation at Helm's Deep. Overall, I thought that the film was well put together though not quite up to the level of the previous film.To me, the film's major drawback is in the changes to the source material. When I recently re-watched the film my memory was a little fuzzy regarding the events of the book. I didn't see any blatant problems with the film's story but, later, when reviewing the screenwriters' 'improvements' to Tolkien's novel, I recalled why I initially had reservations. I felt that the character changes made to accentuate the ring's power made the characters affected less interesting while the couple of situations added to create tension were unimaginative and, in one case, nonsensical. Nevertheless, this kind of nitpicking will probably only be done by those who are familiar with the details of the novel.All in all, "The Two Towers" is a worthy follow-up to the "The Fellowship of the Ring". It's a bit of a step down in terms of quality but Peter Jackson still did a decent job of keeping the story interesting for three hours, especially considering the fact that most of the film is just a build-up to the climactic confrontation, not to mention the concluding film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anything rhyme with Uruk-hai?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trilogies have one major flaw -- it's not so much a fault, just an inherent difficulty. In the case of the middle film of the original Star Wars trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back, it was overcome; here, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, it was not.The flaw is the meandering middle, and the first hour of this otherwise fine movie suffers from it. The story begins where the first film ended, and we the audience now have three different paths to follow: Sam and Frodo; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli; and Merry and Pippin. The latter proves the most entertaining, and unfortunately the duo of Frodo and Sam -- and later the addition of Gollum -- is all but glossed over, given enough attention to inform but only as an end to set up Return of the King.These are not necessarily complaints -- this is an epic, not a character tale, and in epics priority is given to battles and large set pieces. The Two Towers spares nothing in this regard, as the Battle for Helm's Deep is eloquently captured, a delight to watch.Finally, though, in the last hour of the movie, we are given a break from the carnage and are offered a little reprieve with the addition of David Wenham as Faramir. He, as well as Elijah Wood, solidify this film as more than entertaining filler and deepen our understanding of the characters and their hardships.Once again, the special effects are astoundingly good -- and, unlike in the first movie, here they don't draw too much attention to themselves. The set, wardrobe, and production designs serve to illustrate the cultures they represent, to add a history and sadness to the peoples they envelop, shelter, and clothe.Gangs of New York was the best film of 2002, but right behind it was The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film has its problems and its issues that need straightening out but when it's not trying to offend, it is definitely entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the second Lord of the Rings film is more manipulating than it is entertaining or epic. It's true to say that I had only seen this for the first time very recently and did not have the previous viewing that I had going into the first Lord of the Rings film, (which I liked then and liked now) so to say I enjoyed this to a lesser extent may be down to those reasons; maybe it's a film that grows on you with repeated viewings.But The Two Towers is a somewhat bloated and manipulating film that has its moments of greatness and sheer adventure packed in amongst some shocking issues of representation and general repetition, but the film is an all round success overall. Harking back to the Classical Hollywood days in which if someone was shot or killed, a sudden, stirring and jarring piece of music may start up to officially 'announce' the kill since you could not show the murder itself because of censorship. Here, the music is playing that sort of role again but it is to the opposite sort of effect; every long shot we cut to, every establishing shot of vast mountains and hills (some of which are in CGI format) we see are accompanied by over the top, melodramatic music that brings an odd smile to my face while watching. It's the sort of cue for all of us to hold our hands to our cheeks and gasp in amazement. The film tells us when to be scared, happy, wary, who to like and dislike and when to laugh; which is a shame.Sticking with the melodramatic theme, some of the situations the characters find themselves in are made all the more so when they need not be. There are numerous insert shots and several lines of dialogue surrounding Aragorn (Mortensen) and another female whose name escapes me as they exchange glances and lines. "I see you're good with the sword" he says after she gives a little teaser as to her skills before the impending doom. Then there are the exchanged looks as he lies down, injured, much later on. But it is to no avail as Aragorn has an off-screen love, but don't worry; she pops up to remind us (and Elrond (Weaving)) of the situation. But the representation and underwhelming attention to detail are the two most frustrating things of this film. I do not know how faithful to Tolkien's book the film is, but from the film I can only gather that either Jackson or Tolkien had a massive problem with short, elderly men who have beards. I'm talking about the dwarfs here and how they are consistently the butt of every joke.The peak of this embarrassing representation occurs during the castle siege scene. Rows of allies are on the upper levels, looking out at the enemy. Gimli (Rhys-Davies) cannot see but everyone else can. "Would you like me to find you a tool?" asks Legolas (Bloom). Gimli's height is mocked here but it goes deeper than that. All the humour in the film is directly a result of Gimli's antics, thus relegating him to the comic relief character. Aragorn and Legolas are in serious conversation with the king but as these two normal sized, athletic and handsome men talk; Gimli is sitting at a table tucking into a drumstick, alienated from the conversation with the camera cutting to him just once; so he can belch and maybe cue some laughs. After this belch, the camera cuts back to the conversation and everything continues after the 'funny' pitstop.But it's not the weight, looks and height that is merely targeted; the pratfalls continue when Gimli embarrasses himself after not correctly fixing his armour ? it slips off him and he is left to rue an awkward moment when Aragorn and Legolas stare and smirk below Gimli's waist. Furthermore, Gimli is describing what female dwarfs look like (which is a lot like male ones) before his horse bucks and charges off; Gimli is inferior enough not to be able to control the horse and he falls, while everyone laughs at him. Half way through the film, there is a fight on a plain in which Legolas kills many enemies and Aragorn actually comes close to death to defeat the odds but Gimli is relegated, once again, to the butt of the jokes. He has numerous enemies fall on top of him, rendering him incapacitated as he groans and hopes the others do the work for him.Of course the film is not one long exposure; but an interesting and well un-folded tail about the tiniest of things that can do the largest of damage. The manipulation of time early on is impressive as we discover what happens after other timelines catch up and leave off. Whereas I noted a whole load of bad things about the film, that does not mean I didn't like it. Legolas and Gimli's colloquial approach to the final siege as chaos and murder occurs around them to those of an inferior skill is in bad taste, as is making the enemy men whom ride large elephant creatures look like Arabs; with their clothing and veils. Gollum's schizophrenia and delusion seems a little unnecessary and do drag on but they will suffice, that is all. I do not buy into the mountains of praise the film gets; pretty to look at and reasonably fun to watch, yes, but will it hold up over time? Probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lesser film of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved FOTR and have seen the SE DVD about 8 times already. And yet, I left The Two Towers a little disappointed, and a little bewildered by all those reviews that claim it is "better" than FOTR. Now, don't get me wrong -- The Two Towers is a fantastic movie. In fact, it's hard for me to put into words what I think is "wrong" with it -- if that's even the right way to say it -- it just didn't have the... sparkle?... of FOTR to me.Here's a few specific nitpicks: - We just don't see enough of the characters, and they don't interact with each other as poignantly as in FOTR. Sure, there's more action, more battle -- but less... life... somehow. - Does Grima have to look so obviously evil? Did Jackson say, "The audience is too stupid to realize he is a bad guy, so we need to make him look like a walking corpse so that the idiots watching this movie will understand." - What's the deal with the way Theoden looks when we first see him? I guess they wanted to show his corruption "visually"... but they went too far, and the difference is drastic enough to prevent the suspension of disbelief. He should have looked sick, or dark, or something, sure... but not 200 years old. - Not sure what all the hype about Gollum is... he was well done, but the performance didn't blow me away. It was a bit hard to swallow the constant shifting between him being 100% murderous to 100% childlike... I felt like I was constantly "filling in the gaps" with my knowledge of him from the book -- not sure how a non-book reader would take Gollum... he's kinda stuffed down your throat in the movie. - The dream sequences with Arwen were pretty dull. I think they would have been better to stick more closely to the Appendix -- show how they met, etc. Shoulda played up the conflict between Aragorn and Elrond more, or something. - The changes to Faramir didn't thrill me. I think it was the point where he puts his sword to Frodo's throat that it just goes to far. I just don't see why this darker Faramir was better for the movie than the gentler book version (though I said the same about the darker Prancing Pony in FOTR... ). And in what way was the Osgiliath trip an improvement? It didn't seem to do anything besides introduce a new set. - Eowyn seems under-used, alas. During the battle of Helm's Deep, my wife leaned over and said to me, "What ever happened to Eowyn?" -- she needed some sort of role there -- not battling, but at least doing something. - I didn't mind them bringing the elves to Helm's Deep... but there is a cynical side of me that thinks they only did it because they wanted to bring in Haldir... someone known and yet expendable. I can't think of anyone else who would have been better suited -- and so it makes me think that they said, "Okay, who can we kill off that will bring at least a little emotional impact. Sure, Haldir. Okay, now how do we get him to Helm's Deep?"... ;) - I really wish they hadn't used John Rhys Davies as the voice of Treebeard. It's not that there was anything wrong with it -- it's just that I could only hear Gimli whenever Treebeard would speak, and so it ruined the suspension of disbelief for me... (what reminds you that you're only watching a movie more than the same actor in two different roles?) I mean really, couldn't they find someone else? ...so, all of these nitpicks probably make it seem like I didn't like The Two Towers, and yet that's not the case at all. It's a better movie than most, that's for sure! But FOTR was sooo good, it had my hopes up a bit too high for TTT, I guess. (I don't think TTT is going to be nominated for 13 Academy Awards the way FOTR was... I'd say they'll get a Special Effects award, but that'd be about it, I think.)Anyway, I'm happy to report that the Special Extended Edition DVD of The Two Towers goes a long way towards addressing my original reservations.In the Extended Edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the "Most Improved Character" award goes to Galadriel -- but here, in The Two Towers, that award definitely goes to Faramir. You get much better insight into his motivations during the flashback with Boromir (always great to see more of Sean Bean!) and his father, Denethor. In the book, of course, he is never even slightly tempted by the One Ring -- wouldn't even pick it up if he found it lying by the side of the road -- and so it is nice to learn in the Extended Edition of Two Towers that he's not tempted by the Ring in and of itself: he is only thinking about pleasing his father.Another noteworthy addition comes when Faramir first captures the hobbits -- in the Extended Edition, there's a glimmer of Faramir's character from the book when he walks over to the body of the fallen enemy and delivers some poignant lines (which I think were originally Sam's in the book):Frodo: "Those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us."Faramir: "The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is... where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace. War will make corpses of us all."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst of the trilogy, but still an outstanding film. It suffers from both middle child syndrome (no clear-cut beginning or end) and too many story lines (especially near the end), but it still manages to be an incredible achievement. Gollum is superb, both as a special effect and a character. Andy Serkis truly gave the best performance of the film, though Viggo Mortensen was quite excellent as well in a much bigger role. New characters are given the same layered performances as all of the originals. The battle at Helm's Deep and the March of the Ents are amazing to watch, and, once again, the technical aspects are superb. It's just too bad that Gandalf wasn't in it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now This Is Where I Get Kind of Negative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, "Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign." I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying "didn't" or "can't." This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.I gave this movie every chance when my natural proclivities were against it. I was assuredly paying attention, which didn't help me: Once Faramir's party reaches Anduin, one of Gondor's people says Mordor's seized the eastern side. So how do they get to the western side? If they use the sewer that Faramir later sends Frodo and Sam into, why did he explain to them what those sewers were? They'd have seen them already, just like me, who doesn't have to see this movie anymore. And for that I'm thankful. I didn't dislike this film, but I would add The Fellowship of the Ring to my collection and refuse to allow this sequel. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd place for Two Towers (still wins a medal!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been debating on whether to review the original theatrical releases or the Special Extended DVD Editions director Peter Jackson "originally intended audiences to see," but since I have about the same opinions for both with each movie, I've decided it doesn't really matter. If you think it does, I've chosen the original theatrical releases because I don't review the deleted scenes for other movies and do think favoritism is wrong. That being said, all three LOTR films, whether you find them fascinating or slow, are cinematic masterpieces. Pre-emptive warning: If you haven't seen The Fellowship of the Rings, most of this review might as well be in Braille for you.Two Towers marks the beginning of the split-up of the Fellowship. The human-elf-dwarf combo of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davies) go in search of their trailing hobbit friends Pippin and Merry, who were captured by the Orcs. Fortunately, the two prisoner hobbits manage to escape the Orcs themselves into the forest of Fangorn where they are acquainted with the tree-creatures known as the Ents. When their search party enters the forest, they come across an old friend, but I won't spoil how the mystery friend got there. Meanwhile, throughout the film, the carrier of the ring Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his loyal associate Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are continuing their quest to dispose of the ring once and for all. The ring is still taking a toll on Frodo, but not so much as it is with Gollum, a creature formally known as Smeagol who once possessed the ring and has been following Frodo and Sam, waiting for his chance to strike. Without a doubt, my favorite scene is the Gollum/Smeagol split-personality debate, not only because it is a witnessing of some of the best visual CGI in recent memory but also for Andy Serkis' debatably Academy-overlooked performance (I can understand the snub, but I don't agree with it). The Two Towers is a vital piece of the trilogy and fits it as well as the others do, however, of the three, it gets the bronze. My main beef with the film was the Ents and their incredibly slow ways; sure, they add variety and character to the series and do their part in providing an awesome action-packed ending for The Two Towers, but long and literally drawn-out dialogue is about the last thing a 179-minute film needs. Still, this is a small bicker, and the trilogy is still a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson's splendidly unadorned vision of a Tolkien masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may as well start off by declaring that this is my favourite movie of all time. Not that I think it's perfect. It has flaws not apparent in The Fellowship of the Ring, a near-perfect gem of a film. But more about TTT's imperfections later. I didn't "choose" it as a favourite film because it is the best, rather it "chose" me, by speaking to my heart and mind in a way no other movie has before or since has. Within Peter Jackson's inspired vision of The Lord of the Rings, TTT just grabbed me with its uncompromisingly gritty intensity. It is the very centre of a monumental life or death struggle between good and evil. The beginning is long gone and the ending is still far off. I just love that the each of the three groups separated from each other by FotR's Uruk-hai attack never find their friends. They are all driven by simple hope no matter how desperate their situations may get, and this theme is brilliantly summed up by Sam's speech in Osgiliath at the end.The opening sequence of Gandalf fighting the Balrog while they fall is a splendid mix of state-of-the-art special effects and character exposition. The ferocity of Ian McKellen's performance more than matches the spectacular sight of the plunging, flaming Balrog on the big screen. But better is to follow. Andy Serkis and a brilliant CGI team brings the repulsive and pathetic yet compelling creature Gollum to life in a way inconceivable before the release of this movie. The other new characters add to the intrigue as the Rohan's struggle for survival unfolds. The actors playing Eomer, Wormtongue, Eowyn and Theoden are perfectly cast, as the story flows seamlessly from the ending of FotR.As for the controversial changes to the book of TTT, I feel they are justified. Aragorn's urging of Arwen to leave Middle Earth is a noble act of self-sacrifice. The further exposition of Arwen's character and her relationship with Aragorn adds so much to our understanding of him. He is a more rounded and vulnerable character as a result. To not bring Arwen and Aragorn's tale out of the RotK appendices would have been a grave injustice, because within the narrative of the book her character is badly underwritten. I also liked seeing the Elves at Helm's Deep, because viewers who haven't read the Silmarillion would not realise the extent of their losses in previous wars with Melkor and Sauron. The addition of Faramir's bad decision-making is even more controversial, but I say, why not make him more suitable for the unforgiving medium of film? On the page he is a wonderfully written character, but after just a cosy chat with Frodo he lets him go on into the heart of Mordor with the Ring! The film audience would start to doubt the power of the Ring with Faramir being so immune to it, and also would end up wondering in RotK if it was actually necessary for Aragorn to take over the rule of Gondor from such a perfect heir to the now-dead Denethor. In the film Faramir's development as a character is extremely moving, culminating in his final quiet decision to release Frodo.In this film Faramir, Aragorn and Theoden are real characters I can better identify with, rather than the idealised figures of Tolkien's original book. I am not putting down Tolkien, because I love his writings and will defend them against his critics, but am merely pointing the difference between contemporary films and traditional literature. His characters are problematic on the big screen if left unadapted, and I believe Jackson has done this and kept the essence of the story. However, to avoid the impression that I am totally uncritical of this film, I will say that Jackson has not done justice to the power of Treebeard's character as written by Tolkien. He seems to be senile at times! TTT's epic battles are just brilliant. The Warg fight is a nice entrée, but Helm's Deep is a stunning main course. The beautifully developing friendship of Legolas and Gimli is a real high point. Of course hardened solders make jokes in the middle of battles! Then we have possibly the most spine-tingling moment of the whole trilogy, as the Rohirrim charge out of the rising sun into the massed ranks of Uruk-hai, led by Eomer and Gandalf the white rider on Shadowfax. This is the sequence in my LotR EE DVDs that gets the most replays! Another reason this is my favourite is that it has less things to distract from plot and character development than do FotR and RotK. The homely Shire, glittering Lothlorien, the ghostly Army of the Dead, the great spider Shelob, the awful Mountain of Fire, the pageantry of the Minas Tirith coronation, and the glow of the Grey Havens do not appear. The only idyllic place, Rivendell, is a troubled memory in Aragorn's tortured thoughts. Helm's Deep at night is not the majestic site for a battle that is Minas Tirith in daylight. Don't get me wrong, I love LotR's spectacle, but in TTT the life and death scenarios seem even more fraught and desperate without the unforgettable backgrounds.I must add a comment about the Extended Edition, to illustrate a further flaw. Unlike FotR, TTT relies on its EE to add details which make the story more understandable. Jackson unfortunately left out of the theatrical version the flashback scene in Osgiliath between Boromir, Faramir and Denethor. While this decision aided the pacing of the movie, it left Jackson open to criticism that he had thoughtlessly marred Faramir's character. This scene provides back-story explaining why he first decides to take Frodo and the Ring to Minas Tirith. The EE is needlessly essential viewing as a result, but I would still recommend it regardless, because as with FotR it does add cream to the cake of a classic movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film, but a little sloppy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst Peter Jackson's directorial talent and the wonderful imagination of Tolkien himself are the fundamental backdrop of the second installment of the "Lord of the Rings" franchise, I increasingly get the feeling that this film was an excellent one, but one that was a little patchy at times. Overall, a visual and emotional extravaganza, but the film slows slightly and stands as a notch below both its predecessor and its successor.The CGI is absolutely brilliant, and the ability that Jackson and his team at Weta were able to use state of the art technology to create the character of Gollum is remarkable -- his performance is as strong as Frodo and Sam's, and this wonderful and realistic chemistry highlights much of the film's merit. The expansive battle at Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, as is the March of the Ents on an unsuspecting Isengard. It is not in the visual effects that the film falls a little flat.Viggo Mortensen, whilst looking the part of Aragorn, seems to be patchy in his portrayal, representing his fair inexperience within the world of Hollywood. His delivery of lines is, at many times, stale and thus puts a substantial patch on the credibility of what is one of the more important characters within the story. That being said, he does possess a steadfastness and visual courage that is practically unmatched by all of the other cast -- it's when Mortensen is really challenged that he seems to struggle slightly. Orlando Bloom is terrible and remedial as always, once more looking the part brilliantly but not even possessing the basic ability to recite a line without showing conflicting facial expressions, and a real inability to understand both his character and the direction of the story. The other members of the supporting cast are excellent - Elijah Wood is fantastic as Frodo, a hobbit perpetually under the emotional and mental attack from the One Ring. Sean Astin is unwavering as Sam, and Christopher Lee plays an increasingly evil Saruman to a tee. Sir Ian Mackellan is positive and competent as Gandalf.The score, whilst being quite good, falls flat slightly. The cinematography, especially the wide expansive shots amongst a beautiful and untouched New Zealand countryside, is nothing short of breathtaking. The introduction of new characters, such as those that dwell in Rohan, is excellent. Even the addition of the ENTS is a worthy one, and one posing many thrills and laughs along the way.All in all, this film aimed for perfection but didn't quite get there. It was not as raw or majestic as the first film, and wasn't as emotionally expansive as the final chapter. Standing alone, the film is endearing and entertaining. However, some patchy acting from main cast members and the patchiness of both the script and the score taint this film from what it could potentially be.An 8 out of 10 -- a remarkable achievement, standing alone, but quite easily the patchiest and most inconsistent of the film franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bored of the rings again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Lord of the Rings' is a much liked, but also widely derided book (aactually three books, just as it is now three films). It's not hard to see why both opinions are held. The narrative has epic sweep, but the moral motivations of the characters are simplistic in the extreme. They may be torn between good and evil, but these are presented as primeval, opposing forces: the concept of mixed motive scarcely exists. The much noted absence of sex from the book typifies this: it's not that the book would benefit from sexual content per se, rather that the heroic model of its universe cannot accommodate anything as challenging as the fusion of love and lust.Yet I actually like the book, with its rich descriptive language. In fact, the monsters and landscape so described were long considered unfilmable; but with the aid of modern computer graphics, Peter Jackson has achieved a visually perfect reconstruction of Middle Earth, with almost everything looking exactly as you imagined it from the text (though the orcs seem to be a little influenced by the 'Alien' with their ferocious, flashing teeth). The virtual Gollum is perhaps the most skillfully animated character of any yet rendered on screen. Yet there was another reason why the book should have been tricky to film, and this is the relationship of its the characters to history and time. The novel's best point, in my opinion, is the way that it conveys a sense of a vast, slow journey, one that criss-crosses the routes of a thousand past journeys that collectively have brought the present to pass. Stories are told, often in fragmentary form; and the end of the quest represents not just the end of the foregrounded tale, but the end of an fictional era, and the end of the reader's quest to understand that era as well. This is all essentially wordy stuff, narrative and dialogue, that does not just fill the spaces between the action points, but provides them with their context. And in spite of making his movie over nine full hours, Jackson seems to have been unable to find time for this, and the first film, as well as the first part of this instalment, precede as an unbroken series of fairly meaningless happenings, all spectacular but pointless. For example, when Frodo (the hero) visits the dead marshes, he needs to know how they came to be; otherwise, the fact he sees corpses lying below the water is just empty decoration. In Osgilliath, we see just a random ruined city, not understanding it was once the capital of Gondor. And so on. Jackson has been generally very faithful to Tolkein's plotting (though he takes a few liberties in the second half of this film), but this faithfulness takes the form of completism: almost every image from the book needs to be rendered, but if you don't already know the story, you might struggle to work out why.So although the description of travel was one of the very best things in the novel, this film actually improves in its second half, when the travelling slows or stops, and the story starts to feel less sequential. The changes to the plot, however, are not so successful, because where Jackson should have cut selectively, he has instead largely embellished the action, usually adding more melodrama than was present in the original. So all the heroes need to nearly die in battle; Farmair must be tempted by the ring, just as his brother Boromir was, and the heroes must join him when he fights his rearguard action in Osgilliath; Pippin and Merry must trick the ents into helping out, and so on. Quite why Jackson considered the story needed more incident is hard to fathom, especially as there's a shallow obviousness to this extra material. The emotional impact is further deadened by the decision to play every scene with music. The music is not awful or ill-chosen, but there's no contrast, and one cannot stay in state of heightened arousal for three hours at a stretch. This is a film for which you could make a terrific trailer; but when every scene is played as a climax, the cumulative effect is lessened, not increased. Indeed, the battle with Saruman is given an apocalyptic tone that seems to pre-empt the final part of the story; but this second movie two ends short of the second book, ignoring the potential of tremendous, pessimistic cliff-hanger with which Tolkein concluded his second part.In conclusion, the visuals are great. But the film misses what allows the book to transcend its peculiarities. If you like 'The Silmarillion' (Tolkein's more literary, sophisticated prequel), then this probably isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fellowship has been broken and friendship torn. But new alliances must be made. Frodo and Sam stuck in a maze of rocky landscape must ask for help in the enemy; Gollum. Gollum despises Frodo, as he holds the ring; or the precious to Gollum. Gollum leads them to ht black gates of Mordor, but he knows another way. Aragon, Gimli and Legolas are hunting down Merry and Pippin; meeting an old friend. Saruman has built his army and has sent his forces out to destroy the people of Rohan, leading to one of the best battle sequences in the trilogy; the battle of Helms Deep.Unlike many sequels, this actually moves forward and surpasses the first chapter. While the Fellowship of the Ring built the foundation, The Two Towers continues to build upon it. From the mind blowing sequence of Gandalf fighting the Belroc demon to the explosive Helms Deep battle, it never faulters. While keeping all the characters, giving them equal share on screen, it introduces new people, adding more depth and dimension. The Ents have to be the best new characters, they are just astounding and visually amazing.The fight sequences are wonderfully directed. The battle of helms deep is worth the weight. The inter time i was just amazed and clutching my seat at the intensity of the battle. Though its a minor battle, but the Ents storming Saruman's tower was equally great, those Ents can fight.While Fellowship of the Ring is still a classic, this moves even further and breaks the boundaries, setting up for the biggest ending in this masterful trilogy.</fullReview>

The story was a lot shorter than the book, it left out key characters/incidents etc.2. What's the point of Arwen being on the movie poster if she is barely in the movie? 3. The battle at helm's deep has way too many digital effects that didn't help the movie at all and were completely useless (i.e. legolas skateboarding on the shield) Otherwise the movie was good, and i would actually recommend it, but don't be expecting a perfect remake of the movie.******* out of **********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of The Fellowship of the Ring, I docked half a mark simply because I had to wait for the next instalment. I must, regrettably, do the same with The Two Towers. Like its predecessor, The Two Towers is long, but also like its predecessor, it doesn't matter. Usually long films fail to hold my interest, but if The Two Towers was any shorter it simply wouldn't cover what it needs to cover. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have broken away from the others and are selflessly carrying on alone in their quest to destroy Sauron's ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) search for the other two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, stumble across a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and make their way to Rohan, where the king has been taken over by Saruman (Christopher Lee). The whole thing culminates in an absolutely spectacular battle sequence at Helms Deep, where our three heroes and their mighty army battle against the orcs for close to half an hour. The Two Towers was shot simultaneously with the other two, and is therefore just as visually spectacular as the first part, and presumably, the third part. New Zealand is a beautiful country, and Middle Earth is a beautiful place. Even the dark clouds and volcanic activity of Mordor has a certain ambiance to it. But it is the CGI effects that dominate and shine in this film. In particular, computer graphics have been used to create Gollum (Andy Serkis), brought to life from the real actor's movements. As in the book, Gollum is a tortured soul, who's split personality and desire to possess the One Ring (his 'precious') creates a powerful, yet pitiable, character. Also, there is Treebeard, a walking, talking tree (voiced by Rhys-Davies again) whose lethargic nature comes across in his ambling gait and droning, slow tones. As The Lord of the Rings is really one big movie cut into three parts, it is difficult to rate each part as a separate movie. However, the action sequences in The Two Towers are bigger, better and more frequent than in The Fellowship of the Ring, and the character development continues nicely. It's probably better than the first one, but I won't be able to judge accurately until I see Part 3, due out at the end of 2003. Until then, I give it the same mark I gave the first one. Good-o-meter rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Two Towers" proved the Peter Jackson was a man of sheer brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the people who waited to reserve judgment on these movies until I had seen them all. I was inclined to rave about them as each one came out but with major disappointments like the the Star Wars prequels and Matrix sequels, I realized that you couldn't just take one installments quality for granted. Well suffice it to say that now that I have seen all three the sit on the number two spot on my top ten only beat by "The Shawshank Redemption".Peter Jackson deserves a thunderclap of applause for pulling these movies off so effortlessly. It's hard to imagine a time when I was actually skeptical on whether or not these films would be good. It seemed like a project doomed to failure from the start, especially when you look at Jackson's past resume. Making your name in cheap splatter films doesn't exact sell a person on you ability to handle one of the most epic undertakings in Hollywood history. I was utterly shocked when against all odds he pulled it off.Of course you can't give Pete all the praise. He was added immensely by a extremely talented cast. They all delivered memorable performances and made the most out of a story that doesn't really have much for character development. When I walked away from these movies I felt like I knew all of these characters well and was extremely sad to see their story end. That is this trilogy's greatest accomplishment. It rejuvenated my faith that Hollywood could pull off a great movie such as this and no matter how crappy everything else was throughout the year we always had the new Rings film to look forward to.I'm sad I can't feel that way anymore. 2005 has many films coming out with great potential but I have a hard time getting my hopes up as I have been let down so many times before. "Rings" eliminate those fears as I always had that one ray of sunshine waiting for me at the end of each year. These movies made me feel like a kid again as I gazed in awe at the cinema screen like I hadn't done since I first saw dinosaurs walk the Earth in "Jurrasic Park".I will cherish these movies for years to come and I look forward to being able to introduce my children to them when they get old enough. I only hope they can appreciate them as I do. Cheers!</fullReview>

It's a shame that for a long while to come, the majority will have only experienced the story via the shorter versions. Oh well! For the millions who have enjoyed the longer versions it's the same as being privy to being on the inside of a joke that the majority just didn't get. And repeated viewings only enriches it. But not too many...not yet! Not till "RETURN's..." extended version becomes available so this film can be truly appreciated the way it's meant to be. Not for years have I gotten so much enjoyment out of one film (and I'm not talking about "Two Towers"; I'm talking about "Lord of the Rings"...one story...one film...on 6 DVD discs; not counting the additional 6 DVD bonus discs). The added scenes, some lifted from the novel, some not; adds depth to the story and to the characters. Am already counting the days to the extended "RETURN...".And love Gollum's MTV award's acceptance speech on the easter egg!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Ending In Movie History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow you know the feeling when you come out of the cinema having just seen a really great film and it actually changing your mood and everything. You know the Feeling in the months leading up to see a movie that has been hyped up so much and you think as usual that it will not live up to the hype well in my time only two movies have ever lived up to their hype Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers is one of them and a certain George Lucas Film is the other. I remember sitting in the cinema thinking i really don't want this to end and when it did i was just blown away a lot well most big movies these days they put all the bang at the start and in first half of the movie to draw in the Cinegoer. Too often by the end they have spent all there money and effort to get you in to the movie then to not really worry how the movie ends well all the greats in movie history have been the Opposite have had amazing spellbinding endings that stay with you for years Shawshank Redemption Good Bad and the Ugly Sixth Sense Saving Private Ryan Need i Say More.LORD OF THE RINGS TWO TOWERS to me is what empire must have been like to the generation before me because it totally lived up and bettered what i had expected which rarely rarely happens. It took me awhile Like the fellowship but by the time the second film came out i was one of the legions.First of all the movie starts off just nice and slow just reestablishing characters setting the stage for what is to come okay so there may not be Two Hundred Thousand Orks and a grand white city but what the movie does have is the element of surprise and suspense while the 3rd film was the best received of the three we all kinda new what was going to happen and to me it just felt like two towers on steroids i like rotk heaps but i just wasn't as sweept away as in the second film the battle of helms deep is built up so well gandalf coming back to kick some evil ass frodo and sam meeting the twisted yet intriguing Gollum and then the movie takes sauramon from being the agressor to the one who is bieng attacked and you get to go along for the ride the bit that just really brought this movie home for me was when the ents have deceided not to go to war and treebeard is going to drop the hobbits off when all of a sudden he walks out into a brutilized cut down part of the forest while he is talking away when all of a sudden he and everything go quiet score and all then the music starts up and the ents go to war and the movie goes up another level another good sort of surprise was when gandalf reappeared even tho he dropped big hints at a return with help you get so caught up in the movie that when he does come you are o i forgot and phew . which says a lot for the movie.What more could you want from a movie i recommend this to everyone its great on Big Screen with all the bells and whistles it just gives it that oompth and impact you will feel like the volume is getting turned up as the movie goes but thats just the pace. I have to say that this is as close to perfection as a fantasy film can get i along with the rest of us humans well most of us loved it and will surely watch it many more times in the future. Thank Peter and Mr tolkien and everyone else for all the fun. Its Sad that its over</fullReview>

Other than that, this is a real great sequel that is somewhat overlooked in the trilogy.The character development is great as the fellowship breaks into three groups. I think we can all identify with one of these characters and imagine what we would do given these circumstances. Imagination. That's the name of the game. If you think it's not a valuable asset, ask Peter Jackson, who allowed himself to use imagination to make into a movie his favorite series of books from his youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gollum Steals the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The DVD is the wide screen theatrical release edition featuring the theatrical release of the film and an additional disk with some special features.It covers two discs with a running time of almost three hours; `Two Towers' is an incredible sequel to `Fellowship of the Ring.' For the first time, viewers get to see Gollum in the flesh so to speak. The animated character acted by Andy Serkis definitely steals the show with the awesome visual affects, dialogue, and contrary emotions this complicated character has. The film continues where `Fellowship' left off but propels the story forward at an amazing pace.We are indulged in the scenery of Rohan and the immense Battle of Helm's Deep but also are exposed to the first appearance of the Ents who are living, sentient tree people. `Two Towers' also brings the characters of Merry and Pippin to the forefront allowing actors Billy Boyd and Dominic Monahan to shine. Of course, the story of Frodo and Sam's friendship entwined with the journey to destroy the Ring of Power plays a major role and continues to develop.True fans of the novels and first film will especially enjoy this DVD. Retailing at $17.99 the DVD is a good buy but unfortunately falls short in the special features department. The special features gems include Sean Astin's short film, `The Long and Short of It' and the trailer for `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.'Although the film is a joy and the special features entertaining people may wish to wait and purchase the extended version of the film instead. If the extended version of `Fellowship' is any indicator, `Two Towers: Extended Version' will be a DVD everyone must add to their collection. Having scenes expanded and cut scenes integrated with the film and a plethora of special features will make the extended version more in demand than the theatrical release.While we wait, `Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' theatrical release is a good buy with its fun special features, and DVD-ROM content. It includes English and Spanish subtitles but no available dubbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rings Saga Continues Successfully In The Two Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's The Two Towers successfully continues the epic saga that is The Lord Of The Rings. The film introduces several new characters that play key roles in this film as well as the third film. Theoden, Eowyn, and Faramir are the main ones. Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and David Wenham are all effective in their roles, especially Otto as the daughter trying to show her worth to her father and Aragorn. The film also treats us to the two wonderful computer generated characters of Gollum and Treebeard. The film opens with a brief bit recapping the end of the first film. Then in this film, the fellowship is split into three groups of characters. Frodo and Samwise continue their journey alone with Gollum; Pippin and Merry are captured by the Uruk-Hai warriors before meeting up with Treebeard; and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel in search of Pippin and Merry, but end up being drawn into other adventures. The film blends these story lines for the duration of the film. As in the first film, the action, cinematography, costumes, crafts, score, sets, special effects, technical wizardry, and weaponry are all tremendous. The film culminates in the dramatization of Helms Deep, a tremendously exciting battle sequence. It ends with the realization that all of Middle Earth is now in great danger and faces perilous times, setting the stage for the third film. The film is not without its weaknesses. Gandalf disappears for several stretches during the film and he was one of the main characters of the first film. The hobbits become more like instruments that serve the plot instead of characters that create it. Frodo's and Samwise's scenes with Gollum are a little tedious at times. Pippin and Merry have little to do once they meet Treebeard. Aragorn is more of the main protagonist in this film, while Legolas is just a skillful fighter and Gimli more and more like comic relief. The great battle itself (it's progression, complications, and conclusion) is somewhat formulaic in retrospect. However, none of these things detracts from the enjoyment of The Two Towers and the spectacle that the Lord Of The Rings has become at this point. It is still an outstanding film in every respect. There are also numerous scenes that one can perceive as modern political parallels in the film, including Treebeard's decision to involve his friends. Once again, as in Fellowship Of The Ring, the film's pacing makes the long running time seem shorter than it is. The film won Oscars for Sound Editing and Visual Effects. ***1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unsatisfying mess.(minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My problems with this movie are many. The love for the first one really made me antsy to see the next installment. What i saw was a complete disregard for the characters and themes of the first film. The Two Towers introduced waaaaaaay too many characters while leaving established characters from the first film by the wayside. The procession of new characters became tiresome especially in the wake of Gandalf's near total disappearance from the film. The visuals continued to be astounding but i knew that from the first film. The action was larger on scale but lost all of the personal feeling from the fellowship. Helm's Deep quickly fell into the trap of repetition and sky shots of stuntmen and CGI. The rest of the story is supposed to be carried by Frodo and Sam and their journey towards Mt. Doom. I was wholly disappointed with Gollum who was well done technically but not as a character. The longwinded scenes of him talking to himself were tiresome and soon also became repetitious. I think Two Towers disproves the logic that bigger is always better. As Two Towers expanded a great story of a group with a goal into a giant world war epic that lost its characters in a sea of war.</fullReview>

It's quite sad that they cut away so much of the ents, when they (in my oppinion) where my favourites in both the movie and the book. They could have cut away the arwen vs aragorn part instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say it again....LOTR SUCKS, BIG TIME! This ranks as one of my all time worst movies (yes, I've seen it, and I will NEVER see the third.)This is an inane plotline, and the movie drags on to the point where I actually pulled my hair out and said "Thank You" when it ended!No one knows just how much I can't STAND LOTR, any of them. Liv Tyler is the only good thing, except for Sean Astin and Elijah Wood. Orlando Bloom fails to live up to hype. He was better in POTC (Pirates of the Caribbean).One way I can summarize my hatred: if I was offered $50 million, and all I had to do was watch it, I'd forego the millions.And, no, I'm not crazy.Return of the King shouldn't win Best Picture....or any other Oscars, actually. GO MYSTIC RIVER!!!! (This is the only other thing I had to root for, since Cold Mountain didn't get nominated for Best Picture or Director, which it should have.) TIM ROBBINS RULES!!! This is an all-time low for Ian McKellen, and I'd rather see him in X-Men.Oh, and it gets much worse.Dominic Monaghan (Spelling- I don't care)is perfectly cast....as a hopeless elf. And Cate Blanchett? Come on! She hasn't done anything good since "Elizabeth"! Peter Jackson wasted his budget on this film. It may take home Best Picture and Best Director for Jackson, but it doesn't deserve it. You know the guy who was frozen or something in "A Clockwork Orange"? That's the only way I'd see this movie...and then I'd plead insanity.These movies shouldn't even be in the Top Ten.WORST MOVIES 1. (tie) These three films and From Justin to Kelly. 2. These three movies 3. THESE THREE MOVIES!!!!!!!!&gt; AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Feel my wrath!Don't worry about spoilers, there are none worth writing.But I'm far from done.What was the spending budget? It shouldn't have been spent on a flea-bag flick like this. They should have spent it on something like "The Last Emperor" which is totally fabulous. But LOTR has no chance 35 years from now. Sure, I'm no psychic but there's a good chance. I mean, how many people actually admit that they still enjoy "Titanic"? That was also crap, BTW. I mean, COME ON!!! Gandhi was totally a better movie (sure, its from 1982, but it's a classic).I WILL NOT BE SILENCED! I WILL HEAR INCENUATIONS! EVERYTHING WENT WRONG! (This is a Family Guy inside joke.Several more things wrong with this movie: 1. Sean Bean should have been in TTT 2. How much of it was visual effects anyway? 3. Not even Elijah Wood can save this series. He's cool, but this was a terrible career choice. 4. And finally....What will Peter Jackson do next? An adaptation of War and Peace, for crying out loud?Lastly...LOTR fans, I respect your views, but I have waited SO LONG to bash these films!I won't be silenced!Au revoir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On one hand, it's an improvement over the first chapter. On the other hand, that is, unfortunately, not much of an accomplishment. Like most movies that run more than two hours (in this case, a LOT more than two hours), it would have been vastly improved by aggressive editing. Once again, we have wooden characters (although they are starting to show some signs of life), settings that suffer from a deplorable excess of styling, and a story that really isn't all that interesting or coherent. In it's favor, we again have nice effects, but it still feels too much like Xena, Warrior Princess with a better budget, and probably less interesting characters. Maybe Joxer the Mighty will appear in chapter three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>APPARENTLY ?Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' wasn't a historical film, it was a fantasy film. Thanks to the people who messaged me and told me that, mostly rather rudely, but if it's meant to be a fantasy why base it in middle England, or rather (as Jackson decided when he wrote it) Middle Earth? Duh? If I was going to write a fantasy film I wouldn't put Jesus in it, or an evil Jesus doppelganger, but then nobody reads my scripts do they? Well I say nobody, but that guy from the CIA was interested in my hilarious Whoopee Goldberg vehicle ?Jihad Act', although I'm not sure that his review of it as `Incitement to Terrorist Activity' was altogether fair.Anyway, because Hollywood won't finance my films I have to go and watch ?fantasy' movies by that bearded lunatic Peter Jackson. So what does he do in the sequel to ?Lord of the Rings'? Well, firstly the good Jesus doesn't die (technically correct) when he's pulled into a fiery chasm by a winged giant (there are too many inaccuracies to even start discussing here).But after some cockneys kidnapped some of the stunted thieves from the first film, the Welsh Bloke, the lady with the bow and that guy in the tight shorts from GI Jane (who doesn't wash in this film) chase them on foot for about 300 miles! I can't run 300 yards let alone 300 miles and I've seen what Jackson looks like. I bet he couldn't even run 30 yards! Luckily for them a tree (I'm not making this up) rescues the guys from Bucks and then wanders around aimlessly talking rubbish. Jackson, trees don't walk, talk or have meetings with (wait for it) other trees. Wasn't somebody there when Jackson was writing this stuff to stop this sort of nonsense from happening?Peter Jackson: `?and then some trees come to life and save them.'Overseer: `Jackson you bearded spaz! That makes no sense! Write a better story!'If I'd written it, it wouldn't be a tree (which the more I say it the more it makes no sense) that saved them; it'd be Whoopee Goldberg. She'd show them that by thinking outside the box and breaking a few rules that war in Middle Earth could be fun! `C'mon! We can really rock this place!' She'd say as she brandished a battleaxe at a Cave Troll.But Jackson decided (against popular opinion I'm sure) not to put the talented Ms Goldberg in this film, which is its primary reason for its failure. Regardless of his poor casting abilities the thieves from Bucks continue their journey towards a burning hellhole (that I presume is meant to be Slough). This skinny guy with huge eyes turns up because he wants the ring, and quite rightly gets put on a leash. Meanwhile Cockneys attack loads of villages and some other things happen that culminate in a huge battle. To be honest the massive hell-storm of historical inaccuracies that Jackson decided to insist were real just got too much for me at this point, so I will say no more on the subject. You've pushed me too far now Jackson, you and that blatant liar Ang ?my film has a dragon in it' Lee. And it's not because I'm ?emotionally unstable' (hear that Derek Palmers?) but because of your ludicrously inaccurate ?historical' pap and Ang's horrendous false advertising. Why don't you both make a film together called ?Gandhi' about the life of the leader of the famous Indian revolts? That way you could make sure there'd be no one called Gandhi in it and the British could be replaced by massive blue robots with laser eyes and hands that fired atomic rockets! Then of course JESUS would turn up on a horse (it was an ASS Jackson) being chased by something stupid, like a burning fish with legs and you'd BOTH get Oscars for it! Awwww man? I'm getting really angry now.It's no good. I'm too furious to even rate this film! Actually, I'm not rating this film and I'm even going to take a point off my ?Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' review from the 4th October 2002! That puts it at a humiliating 8 points! That's my lowest award EVER Ang (except for Iron Eagle II)!If you cry yourself to sleep tonight then you got off lightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not an offended fan of other movie cults, like the overrated Star Wars &amp; Harry Potter films. I simply found this film to be somewhat dull. Little characterization as well as too many characters (although Gollum was a treat.) Light on any plot points that add onto FOTR. Frodo &amp; Sam start the movie walking towards their destination and end up doing the exact same thing, just closer and with an added tag along. The movie makers seem to think that big battles are interesting. Fortunately there are less battles than FOTR, but the ones that are featured here are mostly unnecessary. The bad guys just show up to pad the film, not further the movie. This series could have been (and still could be) condensed into one exciting three hour film with only three or four battle scenes that actually matter (the one that takes Ian McKellen, maybe the castle siege and then a climax.) Instead the films are like listening to someone who stutters. Sometimes you get a lot of the good stuff (character, plot &amp; scenery) but then here comes a stutter (battle.) It isn't just the battles that draw this out. Why did the trees have to gather together, agree to do nothing, go north, go south, see the chopped trees and then decide to fight? Couldn't we have cut out all those steps? I also got tired of the dozens of times the main characters are seconds from death and then are saved by a tree or flying arrow. We all know they'll most likely survive, so where is the suspense? There are many positives to the film, such as the scenery, Gollum, trees and the occasional sequence. But after three hours of epic battles I started desiring some social commentary, not a quest to dispose of a ring (although I wonder if Tolkien wrote these when he had marital problems.) The ring becoming addictive like a drug is as close as close to commentary as it got. The middle earth seems to take the least interesting aspects of the real one (like potatoes &amp; bread) add fantasy characters and then totally ignore its allegorical ties. Maybe I don't understand fantasy world setting. I can see someone creating a medieval world of unicorns, elves and wizards for four books, like Tolkien did, but why have others re-used that same made-up world for thousands of books and hundreds of movies rather than creating a new made-up world (like the sci-fi genre does.) Oh well, I hope King Kong is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweeping, epic failure --- POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying that "The Two Towers" is an impressive film, or that it is generally entertaining, but it is deeply flawed as well. I truly believe this could have been a great film, but because it is burdened with numerous problems it is ultimately a failure.I enjoyed Tolkien's writings as a child, and reread them with pleasure as an adult, so when the first film came out I excitedly rushed out to see it. On the whole I enjoyed it, although it had some elements that bothered me. I was especially annoyed by Merry and Pippin's antics. At the time I was not too worried about the quality of the following movies on account of what I had seen since I knew Merry and Pippin would have to carry a large part of the second movie, and I assumed their characters would have to be made less "comedic" for them to do so.Unfortunately, not only are they still annoying, but the character Gimli has also been made to provide comedic relief. I have no issue with comedy in the context of a serious movie, but the comedy here just was not funny. At one point, for example, unable to see over the battlements behind which he stands, Gimli requests a box to stand on.Movies and books are different media, and a movie based on a book (or the reverse) can be judged without reference to its source material, and certainly is by those not familiar with the source. That said, those who are familiar with the book will come to the movie with some expectations of fidelity. When the director presents material different from that in the book, he should do so because such changes enhance the movie. When changes would negatively affect the movie, they should not be made. Many of the changes Jackson does make are of the latter category. Even without reference to the books, the flaws of the film are glaring.There is a deliberately archaic feel to much of Tolkien's writing, and Jackson's screenplay largely obliterates this. He introduces contemporary touches which take away from the mythic qualities of the work, although these touches, no doubt, do render his project more commercially viable. Worse than this, some of the dialogue is just bad, and changes to the screenplay would have made "The Two Towers" a better film.The introduction of the elves into the Battle of Helm's Deep appears to be motivated largely by a desire to have more elves in the film. It serves absolutely no other purpose that I can see, and is absolutely contrived. What is more, their marching in order, and turning their heads in unison towards the camera is ludicrous. I was torn again from a mythic world to a vision of a parade of US Marines with pointed ears.The film also suffers from poor pacing. The middle of the movie, revolving around the character of Aragorn, is a mess. The dream sequences create a tedious morass that should have been edited out. Even the events leading up to these scenes should have been removed. They are deliberately manipulative, attempting to create tension about Aragorn's survival, but completely failing to do so.Even the concluding battle, which has been much praised in the press, left me unstirred. Ralph Bakshi did a better job at depicting the battle in his 1978 film. The action is not particularly dramatic, and the repeated attempts at comedy ensure that whatever tension is built up is quickly dissipated.The end of the film is meandering and pointless. Although "The Two Towers" does not complete the story being told, the dramatic impact of the film's conclusion could have been strengthened. Instead, the movie just peters out. Bakshi's film, by contrast, does build up to an impressive denouement. Tighter editing could easily have helped to build a sense of tension which would have made the victory over Saruman more satisfying.For most viewers, both those familiar with the books and those who are not, "The Two Towers" will be a rousing adventure. The special effects are stunning. The acting is generally good. Jackson was perhaps a little too in love with his project, however. Had the middle of the movie been excised, the end re-edited into a more dramatically compact entity, and some of the dialogue rewritten, he could have produced a great film. He did not, and we are left with a sweeping, but ultimately unsatisfying epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all,I would like to comment on the changes to the script of these movies. Having just seen the extended version, I felt a lot happier about the two towers. But we have to remember that Jackson &amp; crew cannot include everything in here, or we would have 6 movies, not 3.For example, is there anyone else who found Tom Bombadil annoying? Read "Bored of the Rings" (a spoof) if you'd like to see my opinion.We have several areas in the book that are about Gollum, but are not really appropriate. If you know Tolkien at all, you'll understand that he wrote the languages first, and then the book to fit around his invention. He himself would not have a problem with the very minor problems the film crew had with parts of the plot!Another good example is also the Elves at Helm's deep. Clearly, 300 people would be massacared far too quickly for this to be realistic or transposable to film. The elves showing up, for me at least, is a very touching and loving moment - I still get a lump in my throat when I first hear the Elven horns whilst Aragorn and Legolas discuss their fate.For the doubters, I recommend you sit back and enjoy this story that is being told in a way slightly differently from the original story teller (like most great stories are). Frankly, if Tolkien were to release the books today, they probably would not get published due to major plot problems, so if you think Tolkien is some kind of God, think again; He was a dreamer (and I'm glad about that).It won't happen, but I pray to God that Jackson can somehow arrange a film of the Hobbit. I can think of no director more worthy.L8rs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Gollum/Smeagol, the film has a double nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Tolkien's books, I had high hopes for this movie, which were partially realized and partially dashed to pieces. My reaction was torn, I wanted to thank Peter Jackson for his dedication and wack him with a frozen tuna, at the same time. The film contains its own internal metaphor in the split character of Gollum.In fact, I'll start by praising Andy Serkis and the CGI team's rendition of Gollum. That in itself was worth the price of admission. The supporting actor awards from Saturn, OFCS, and VES were well deserved. Easy as it might be to find flaws with Jackson's renditions of certain characters or plot elements, Gollum is above reproach and interacts with the Hobbits amazingly well.Also well done are the short battle scenes twixt Gandalf and the balrog. Gandalf's character is generally well played, and most of the scenes with Gandalf are satisfying.As a sensory spectacle, everything about this movie is breathtaking. The cinematographers, costumers, and set designers should be lauded for impeccable work. The CGI is overdone at points, but perfect in others. I cannot fault the effects. The sound is solid, and unlike the first film in the series, everything that needs to be heard can be heard.So where is the split? Where does it go wrong? Well, I can't help but feel that Jackson has done a great disservice to Tolkien's original vision, at the same time he does it homage. Where characters were simply omitted from the Fellowship of the Ring (Bombadil, Goldberry, Old Man Willow, Barrow Wights, etc.), in The Two Towers they are mutilated beyond recognition.The worst damage is done to the Ents and Faramir. The Ents are among the oldest creatures in Middle Earth, valuing cautious deliberation and patience above all else. In this movie, they are depicted as hasty. Never would I have thought to see a hasty ent! Not only that, whereas in the books they decide to assist the Rohirrim and depose Saruman through patient deliberation, in this film they are duped into it. Simply unforgivable.Faramir, likewise, makes a transition to the screen which transforms his formerly wise and cautious character into one of paranoia and bungling. Rather than the stark contrast with sibling Boromir, we get more of the same.It would have been easy enough to conceive a script in which these characters stay true to Tolkien's inspired vision without extending it unnecessarily -- indeed, the entire scene at Osgiliath is tacked on via Faramir's distorted character. These are the real crimes against J.R.R. Tolkien, as I see it.The matters of the exodus from Edoras, the elven contingent at Helm's Deep, Arwen's interactions with Elrond and Aragorn, these are all reasonable liberties IMHO. They further character development more-or-less in keeping with the spirit of the original, and may serve in resolving portions of the final film that omissions in the first film complicate (e.g., where will Meriadoc get a blade from the Gondolin Wars, if not from the barrow wight?). It is those added scenes and dialogs which outright destroy perfectly filmable characters that remind me of Melkor's orcish perversion of Iluvatar's elves.The movie is still enjoyable, and for those who have not read the books or who care little for source integrity, it will likely be excellent. I give it a 7, overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good art, but way too violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The special effects are great; the scenery, camera work, sets and costumes are magnificent; &amp; I find no fault with the acting. I can't say that I enjoyed it though. It would be hard to imagine more violence. The battle scene just goes on forever and ever. I just dread the battle scene in the next one, which is supposed to be even bigger and longer.In his original works, Tokien manages to create some wonderful lyrical interludes. The scenes in the forest with the Ents were just delightful in the book, but they are cut short here, much to the movie's detriment, while the battle for Helm's Deep is stretched out. This was the wrong choice.Of course, there are some other bizarre changes in the plot, as noted by some of the other reviewers.The orcs are just hideous, which they should be, of course. You do see the courage it takes to fight them. It does make me a bit sad, though, that they look so much like burn victims. I think burn victims are stigmatized enough, without being seen as looking like orcs.I saw this one on DVD. There was a whole extra disc with documentaries about the movie, trailers, and even a short directed by Sean Astin (Samwise), showing some of the people whose faces you don't get to see in the main movie, particularly the woman who doubles for the short scenes and the man who doubles for the tall scenes. It was cool that Sean had the idea of letting us see their faces, while mostly we see their backs. In the features, somehow Dominic Monaghan (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) seem more like Hobbits off screen than on. This is due to the directorial decisions to focus on the violent parts, rather than the interludes. It's a pity. These two are absolutely fabulous, natural Hobbits who could have given this film some very welcome comic relief.Still, I guess I'll see the third one. I suppose it's too late to plead with the director to shorten up that final battle. Shiver. It's bound to be horrible.</fullReview>

I don't have a problem with fanfiction. I DO have a problem with fobbing off this stuff as the real story.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, the pictures itself are pretty enough, but the film itself lacks any kind of depth and/or character development. After 1 hour of watching this in the cinema I kept asking myself "How much more? When will this finally end?". Both LOTR installments have the same flaw: the characters are hopelessly flat. It's very hard to feel anything at all for Frodo and his companions, frankly I don't care whether they live or die (in the movie). I must say that this is basically true for all Hollywood blockbusters at this moment, pretty pictures but no depth and a worthless plot. Having said that, this is a nice demonstration of what modern computers are capable of (however I could do with 2 hours less of this demonstration), so it still gets 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is possible to love both book and film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read many of the comments people have of the film both here and on theonering.net it seems that a sizable minority of people have problems with Peter Jackson's (PJ) version of the story, and in particular how it changes some of the plot details and character motivations from Tolkien's novel. All of these negative comments seem very sincere particularly the anguish over changes to beloved characters like Faramir, Aragorn and Theoden. I have loved the book since I was twelve years old and have re-read it many times, I followed up by reading the other "canonical" Tolkien works of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. The Silmarillion in my opinion is Tolkien's masterpiece and is the most beautiful work of literature I have ever read and affects me very deeply. As such I think I can count myself as a Tolkien devotee and have spent many hours discussing points of the story with others. From other posts you would assume that I loathe and detest these films for their "heretical and unnecessary" changes to the story.WRONG.Every change PJ has made has been done for a very good reason, taking two of the most contentious changes as an example:- The elves at Helm's deep and the Arwen/Aragorn scenes (inc. her substitution for Glorfindel in film 1). PJ chose to highlight the second relationship as in the main text of the book Arwen was an incredibly peripheral character and her love and motivating force on Aragorn's quest for his Kingdom was relegated to an appendix. I loved the way PJ managed to bring this into the main story and the depiction of Arwen's ultimate fate (as described by her father) was very moving, this depicted one of Tolkien's main themes that all struggle and triumph is tinged with sadness but is never in vain.The Elves at Helm's Deep was another massive change to the book but again was done for the soundest of reasons, in the book (and again we only find out for certain in the appendices) we know that the Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlorien along with the Dwarves of Erebor fought their own battles with Sauron's armies and thus tied up a good proportion of Sauron's power and indirectly saved Gondor. How exactly was PJ supposed to show this in FotR, TTT or the third film? He was already juggling three plot strands with the broken fellowship and to cut back to Lothlorien or the Lonely Mountain would further confuse the audience not all of whom had read the book. His solution to show the solidarity of the different races was for Haldir to turn up at Helm's Deep and die heroically defending the womenfolk and children of an alien race. Again this was the spirit if not the story of Tolkien.I was amongst the most petrified of fans to hear that Lord of the Rings was going to get "the full hollywood treatment" Peter Jackson deserves all of the plaudits being thrown his way by tackling one of the great unfilmable literary works and doing so with awesome visual style and perhaps one of the best sets of casting ever for an epic film.I cannot wait for the EE, (I found the FotR EE better than the theatrical release) and the days cannot go fast enough until RotK is released.For those really puritanical fans of the book I would suggest getting hold of whatever spoilers you can as it makes the films more enjoyable as you are not looking for what is not there but rather at the awesome spectacle in front of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaw dropping special effects and cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy literally starts where the last film ended, but provides a slight amount of subtle exposition so that the viewer can remember who the characters are and their mission, but not so much that insults the intelligence of the serious fan. Not being a fantasy film fan or a Lord of the Rings fan per se, I felt the same after this film that I did after the first installment. While the story may not be in my chosen genre, the production of the film is absolutely amazing. I kept thinking to myself, `Where did this guy come from?' The other Peter Jackson films I have seen other than the Lord of the Rings were The Frighteners and Heavenly Creatures ? both good films, but not remotely in the same category or class as LOTR. The special effects were jaw dropping, particularly the presentation of Gollum. I am critical of CGI because it is often done so poorly, but it was hard to believe that his character was not real due to its seamlessness. Additionally, the spectacular fight scenes and images of thousands of men and beasts alike were astounding. Unfortunately I can only really speak of the technical merits because there are so many characters involved in so many different plot lines that I found myself asking the friend I was with, `Now is that the guy who?.' And `Oh wait, they were going to?.' Constantly. However, this should in no way be construed as a negative to the film, as it is simply a matter of my general disinterest in the actual plot in favor of the spectacle itself. Having said that, I definitely look forward to the final installment, after which I will make a day of it, sit down with all three and have a LOTR marathon: Best case scenario, I will actually get into the plot. Worst case scenario, I will experience excellent filmmaking.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tragedy of Our Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings films have been, to date, a terrible disappointment and a tragic waste of time and money. I was wary from the beginning of the attempt to take a richly historic and poetic novel as the Lord of the Rings and turn it into a three-film special effects extravaganza. That was precisely the result. Things such as plot and character basis were set aside for the endless tirade of effects and action sequences. In spite of everyone's devotion to staying "true to Tolkien" these movies have become a foreign entity. I am aware of the necessities of change when adapting a work of literature to film. However, any tale told by a competent story-teller is worth the hearing. Even one that little resembles the quest so many remember. Peter Jackson is not that competent story-teller. I found the film to be boring and gaudy. It was inundated with shallow moments of "heroism" like so many mismatched beads on a string. It was so completely banal and dull, so completely ill-paced, so completely determined to be a slide show of computer shots set to music, that I am completely discouraged from wasting my time or money to see Return of the King. Lord of the Rings rates with the Star Wars prequels as the most hyped-up rubbish in cinematic history. Even on virtue of mindless entertainment the films rate rather low.</fullReview>

The real problem being they are mostly dumb, dull, ... pick yours.Those add-on were probably inserted to throw some stuff to a wider public (the 50-60 women ?).It could be because of the current world state, but I feel a shade of patriotism s*** in some of them too. The fact some of the character behaves the opposite they are supposed to do doesn't help.On a brighter note, the "Gandalf" first scene is interesting and well done. Everything else is worthless.

		<fullReview>Ok all...I have been greatly awaiting the release of this film on dvd...I was unable to see it in the theaters. Now i have yet to see the film...but thats not really why im writng this. I came to this sight to get a decent review on this film (which i found) and i was horrified by the biased and single-minded comments made by some users. Now..first of all this IS a Film..Movie etc...NOT A BOOK!!! Yes it was based on a very well written and well loved trilogy but the book is the book and the film is the film...they r not intertwineable or in any way to be confused. Fans of the book complained over and over about the lack of people or situations from the book in the movie. For one...you only have so much screen time u can use...how many book fans want to sit through a 4 or 5 hour part of a trilogy?? when u read a book...what takes a few words to describe can take a huge amount of screen time to portray...So of course not all will be included in the film. I mean really..look at titanic...it was based on the actual even but was there a huge love story playing out on board while the boat sank?? No. But without that part...the movie would have never been as well loved and accepted and never become the great piece of filmaking it has. As far as the cgi graphics used in them movie..well some of the comments used on that subject were just stupid (no offense). I remember reading one person say that they would have rather have seen a puppet or an actor in a suit play golem...that it would have been more realistic. For one...how many golems do u know?? None same here..lol.. So why complain about realism to something that doesnt exist? Its suppose to be unreal...bigger and more fantastic than life...not a part of it. As far as the puppet comment...how "real" did the fraggles look...or the muppets?? Come on now.lol. Personally as one who knows how much of a pain computer programming can be..the job they did was outstanding(i have seen all behind the scenes shows :-) )The amount of work it must have taken to come up with the technology to take 100,000 seperate creatures and give each of them a mind of there own and have them act as seperate entities..must have been mind-boggling..they could have easily gave us another mass of mindless drones acting and moving in a military like fashion of follow the leader. In closing i just need to say...Take the movie for what it is..a movie..not a book or a high school project to disect. Sit down...turn down the lights..grab ur popcorn..and enjoy the show... I know i will tonight...but ill be back to write my real review of the movie instead of this rant...lol Happy watching!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really The Two Towers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's film The Two Towers encapsulates a heavily edited and modified version of parts of Book III and Book IV of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, which are normally published as The Two Towers (following the original printings). Indeed, there are many places in the second entry where it only bears a superficial resemblance to the source material. But that, in and of itself, does not automatically condemn a film.The problems with Peter Jackson's The Two Towers are many. Aside from the lackluster direction that action fans are depressingly willing to look away from, and the eminently forgettable score, most of them lie in the telling of the story.Jackson cross-cuts between three different stories in his course; at most, Tolkien only ever did with two. Unfortunately, these stories are not at all similar in tone, and there are points in the major battle sequence where we cut away to rather tranquil scenes. He already had enough difficulty creating anything of a pace or a mood in his subpar Fellowship of the Ring; with The Two Towers he simply falls flat on his face. It is understandable that Tolkien's generally more leisurely step was not well suited for transition to the screen; unfortunately, I don't think the problem was solved even quasi-adequately. Jackson's storytelling skills are highly overrated by fans who have read the books, and I think that on their own the films don't tell the story well enough for any subtleties to be grasped.Worse than this are Jackson's rewrites to the story. I'm not approaching this from a "How dare he rewrite a classic!" aspect, mind you. What upsets me are the way that he alters plot elements and turns them into banal cliches. Theoden's possession, Aragorn's near-death experience, Faramir's temptation, the Elves at Helm's Deep (it was clear that, until the battles in Book V, it was all Men making their stand and not the other peoples of Middle-Earth), the insultingly insipid "Gandalf arrives with cavalry" (why not just have him descend from the Heavens and wipe out the Orcs with a mighty blast of magic?)...not just alterations, but blatant and frankly boring elements that have been done a hundred times before. I could have accepted plot changes if they had made the story better, or even if they had been adequate replacements that worked for a superior filmic pacing, but these are just plain awful and make the resulting film worse. And there were large swaths of material lost in favor of this waffle, which only adds insult to injury.Characters are changed without needing to be; again, the result is always worse. The Faramir depicted in the film, for instance, doesn't serve any real purpose as he did in the book. Most actually seem less three-dimensional here than either in the novel or in the first film, which is quite an accomplishment. To put in something of a positive word, Gollum was a technical achievement (though when I saw it in the theatres twice, audiences laughed - not an effect that seems intended by the source material).Nothing in this mess improved on the source material or even came close to matching it. As a film, it's a passable entertainment if you can overlook the severe pacing issues; as an adaptation it's a miserable failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I would be inclined to say The Two Towers is an exceptional film, however I feel it was way too violent for children. I base a lot of my comments on the reactions I see in my children. And this movie? Even my two year old had a problem digesting it...and she couldn't even understand the plot! Culminate this with some scary ents, and well, you have the idea. This is definitely not Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Shortly after its theatrical release I noticed a good number of children in my apartment building going to school with rings around their necks and imitating Gollum. Innocent enough, sure, but WHAT ELSE ARE THEY COPYING AT RECESS, huh? You can't tell me they aren't viciously beating the bejesus out of one another! This film is definitely geared toward a mature audience, probably 18 or older. Great film for adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has beautiful cinematography, but that is pretty much its only superior quality, and even the beauty of the scenery is tempered by obviously computer-generated effects.If you are not a fan, don't let the hype raise your expectations too much. It is just a continuation of the first film, although more action makes it less boring -- and harder to follow. And it's surprisingly much more morbid and depressing than the first (although someone pointed out this was par for the second part of a trilogy).Why people are seeing this over and over again is completely beyond me. The characters are shallow, typical fantasy characters, the plot is inane, and the dialogue is only a bit more intelligent than that in "Star Wars Episode II." And, aside from a few of the elves and humans, the characters aren't even that physically attractive.I think it must be necessary to read the books first in order to care about these movies, and unfortunately, seeing the movies doesn't even make me want to read the books.Congrats to the "Lord of the Rings" team on making a popular blockbuster and apparently a great adaptation of a classic fantasy story, but people should be aware that this is not a great film. It does not belong in the IMDB top 250, and if you didn't like the first one, you are unlikely to like this one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as Boring as it is Rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My countrymen and fellow Americans, I come here not to praise 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' but to bury it. I don't know if it's a result of being the bridge between the beginning and end of this saga (taking the role of neglected middle child), or a result of unmet sky-high expectations, but I may be alone here in saying, 'Two Towers' was a huge letdown. I'll try and frame my reasoning as to not be attacked by hairy hobbits and men with point hats and long flowing beards.1) Story structure. Unlike 'Fellowship of the Ring', where we're introduced to a rich world and have suitable character set-up, the second LOTR film puts almost all our characters on the backburner and gives us an insufferably long subplot involving a king and his brood. The movie peters out an ending and seems to throw its hands in the air saying, "See ya' a year from now."2) Length. This wasn't a problem with the previous film, but man did 'Two Towers' become unbearable as it went. Some described the first film as three hours of walking; well the second could be described as two plus hours of folks hyping a battle and then -- a battle. Seriously, there's a lot of talk about a significant battle . and that's it. An hour could have easily been cut from this. It got to the point where my girlfriend was sprawled across my lap pleading for me to somehow make the movie end.3) Characterization. So much time is spent doing nothing you think the film would further round the characters? Oh how stupid you would be. Nothing new seems to be drawn from any character, with the exception of the treacherous yet likable Gollum. Several people from 'Fellowship' (Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette, Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellen) have screen time that amounts to no more than a cameo, so why in the world aren't we getting anything more from our already established heroes? Everyone just looks friggin' bored. As was I.4) Excessive dwarf jokes.I re-watched 'Fellowship' and all of the reasons 'Two Towers' suffered were not evident. So what does this tell me? Nothing particularly, except not to see the movie in the theater again. 'Two Towers' is by no means a bad film. The cinematography, production and special effects are all breath-taking and sweeping. I'll still look forward to seeing the next, and last, installment in Peter Jackson's 'Rings' epic, but 'Two Towers' has left a bitter taste of disappointment to linger upon.B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, after TFOTR, I was truly excited to see the next installment. And, like many others before me here have said, it was a disapointment. Farimir made cruel. Treebeard made hasty. Saruman and Wormtongue's role made much less visable. No Huorns. No Grisnak. No thrown palintir. What's going on here?Yes, it is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, no longer Tolkien's. That fact has made me very sad. And where I saw the first film numerous times, this I've seen twice - can not recommend it to anyone - and can see it no more. It is a shame that a project so well started, could not be continued.Perhaps Peter Jackson could not find enough in the 2nd book to hold his interest, so he made up his own story. It's not enough that the story truly belongs to Aragorn - but we have to be hit over the head, repeatedly, to let us know Aragorn is the hero. It's not enough for Frodo to struggle admirably. He has to be turned to "the dark side". It's not enough for Gollum to be villaneous. He has to be made the sympathetic character.If this is how the third film is going to be treated, I think that seeing it one time may be more than too much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsLuckily,for all you discerning movie-goers out there,Davideo (as you know) sees every piece of cinematic work for what it is.And so let me summarise my thoughts on The Two Towers (an astounding title for a film to get away with for a film released after two planes crashed into two certain towers in New York),the inevitable follow-up to the mega-successful (again,hype) Fellowship of the Ring.Well,what can I possibly say?I thought it was overlong,overblown,pretentious and took itself far too seriously.It was even less enjoyable than the first,which I found to be a major disappointment after all the rave reviews and mass publicity.I mean,I think it says it all when the greatest enjoyment I can honestly say I really derived from it was when,in the over-crowded cinema auditorium I was sitting in,two berks sitting next to me who sounded like they'd just inhaled a mass-amount of the whacky-backy,kept shouting out funny remarks whenever a serious or tense moment was coming up.At one particular moment,I really had to bite my lower lip to keep from really exploding with laughter.Normally,I would almost definitely have beared some inner-grudge against them for being inconsiderate of other movie patrons who'd payed good,hard-earned money to watch the film without any interruptions,but I considered this film to be stuck so far up it's own ass,to be honest,and I'm a little ashamed to admit this....I felt more like cheering them on.I mean,COME ON PEOPLE!!!This is a film in which some of the main characters are a bunch of walking ,talking trees (I guess you could call them really 'wooden' actors) and yet we're all going on as if it were Citizen Kane or something!?!I know there are many fans of the books out there who'd eagerly anticipated the release of the movies for a long time,but please!This type of film is this type of film,and it shouldn't get delusions of grandeur and try to be some sort of Lawrence of Arabia style epic.The frankly unbearable length is made even more patronising by all the actors turning in Shakespeare aspiring performances,especially with such atrocious,unmemorable dialogue.Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Great/White? (whatever) is one such actor,but considering how much his appearance in the film was promoted,it's really amazing how little screen time he occupies.Elijah Wood,Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler all turn in standard performances in what I considered standard roles.People go on about how funny some of the Klingon-like,rubber-faced characters in Star Trek look,but check out some of the ugly critters in this movie.They're a hoot.On the plus front,I suppose the end battle scene is relatively impressive,but overall,I at least for one can see how these meandering,self-important tales were concocted by some bored working bloke in Moseley in the late 19th century who couldn't seem to find anything better to do with his spare time other than stare down a well.**</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad director, good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson hasn't the first idea--or perhaps has only the first idea--of how to tell a story in a movie. A character points to a ringwraith and says, 'Look, a ringwraith!'; cut to the ringwraith. In general, that's the extent of Jackson's skill in visual narrative. Also, lacking a sense of story, he lacks a sense of myth, which is one of the two things that Lord of the Rings is. (The other is invented history, which he does get.) Jackson is an enthusiastic but unbridled filmmaker. Sometimes his shots cut together, sometimes not, and have to be glued together with loud music; sometimes his scenes are modulated in proportion to the whole, sometimes not, but you don't notice for all the noise. However, out of an obvious affection for the books, a sense of drama and epic, a goodish script, a mostly good cast, a good crew, a bunch of computer equipment, and all the money in the world, he has managed to cobble together a pair (so far) of classic fantasies, according to movie standards. They would be better viewed in half-hour installments, and, their huge lush landscapes notwithstanding, could do with a lot more fresh air. But they're as good as--and better than--one could sensibly expect.The second film improves on the first--slows up a bit, steers away from the faux 3-D effects, and allows space for some finer and subtler things to emerge: splendid performances in the roles of Eowyn and Faramir, a depth of feeling in the characterization of Gollum, and moments of real visual poetry. But strangely, it's much less like the book, despite its fidelity to details of name and incident and setting. However, the most obvious ways in which Two Towers departs from the book were apparent in Fellowship, too. The books are all story and no drama; the films are just the opposite. The books leave an impression of clearness: clear air, clear water, clear thought; the films are filled with drive, grit, and ceaseless motion--rather like the factory of Isengard, and most unlike the cloister of Lorien. But I'll probably go to see this one a third time, anyway.</fullReview>

One of the strengths of "Fellowship" was that it while it stayed true to the spirit of the book, it made some very smart choices about which scenes to delete or change, which translated into a better movie. "Two Towers" fails to live up to its predecessor in this respect. Many of its changes didn't add anything to the story and, worse yet, took something away from it.</fullReview>

One scene would've been enough, but we since Sam said it to Frodo, we needed Aragorn to say it to some little kid, and then we needed Arwen to tell her father the message of hope because the Elves weren't anywhere near Sam or Aragon to have gottent he message. The audience, regretfully, is present at all three. Plus the scene where Aragorn instills his hope speech to Theoden.I think what the movie shows is that Hollywood is still willing to spend a lot of money to get something right, which is something a vile place like Hollywood should be applauded for, but what the movie also shows is that Peter Jackson has a great imagination, but he's a poor director.Every other one of his movies have been directorial/screenwriting failures, but have had wonderful conceptual ideas with them. But while I was watching the movie I could care less about what happens to any of the men, and half an hour in I could care less what happens to Frodo.And when I thought about it, it just came down to the acting. The acting seems as if the actors were still discovering who the characters were because they had no force given to them by the director. It seems that's how all his movies are, very flat characters. The characters are great in Tolkien's books. And indeed, the actors provide those actions and mannerisms in the movie, but there's nothing else. Elijah Wood curling his eyebrows, and Viggo Mortensen making his pouty faces isn't giving them any depth. Maybe Wood can get away with it as a Hobbit, but not a single human in that picture can. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee give the best performances, from their mannerisms to subtle changes in their face, and it is only because they have been acting so long, they can compensate for a poor director, all great actors can.The poor acting direction is compounded by the moments Jackson chooses to include in the picture. There were atleast ten times that Jackson cut to scenes of women crying and whining, as if that is the only reaction human women can muster up. One was enough, and about the only one that didn't look like complete whining was the one where the mother was trying to hold on to her soon as he was recruited for the battle at Helmsdeep. He also dramatizes events that people who have never read LOTR would know are just plot points. My mother who could care less about Tolkien knew that Aragon didn't die because he COULDN'T die, he's the one of the main characters for christ's sake. And yet Jackson spends about five minutes showing the sad reaction of the characters. Legolas is sad, Grimli is sad, Theoden is sad, then the very next scene is them arriving at Helmsdeep where we see: Grimli is sad, Eowyn is sad, Legolas is sad, Theoden is sad. If not annoying, at the least it's poor scene construction. And the fact is it's poor scene construction from a director/editor point of view because if you looked at the screenplay it works fine.The most disappointing thing is how I could care less how many elves, humans, or orcs died in the Helmsdeep, but welled up with tears when Treebeard saw the forest of Isengard destroyed. When he said "They were my friends" it was devastating. And Peter Jackson did a marvelous job with that. But if a CGI creature from his imagination gets more emotion out of the audience than the humans and hobbits, there's something wrong there with how the director is building up the scenes.I liked the movie like I said, and a lot of the things said about character development and such is true, Gollum and Treebeard are the only interesting characters in the whole thing. I think it took a lot of balls for Peter Jackson to shoot all three movies at once with seven units, and even more balls to think that he could bring Tolkien's vision to the screen. He succeeded wonderfully at it, but failed in heft and emotion of the film as a film itself.They should have Jackson be the "Master Director" and then had another director to just work with the actors, rehearsing them and finding the pieces for a great performance. Even directors like Jeunet know their weaknesses (his lack of mise en scene) and so he got Marc Caro to do the mise en scene for him while he worked with the actors.Oh well. It's only a movie, and they'll probably be more LOTR movies made, just as there have been made in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends say this movie mucks about with the original story too much. I haven't read the novels, so I can't comment on that - but even if my mates are right, should it really have ruined the entire film for them?The movie has much to commend it, even if it's true that Pete Jackson has done more cutting, pasting and meddling than the hard core fans may have liked...1) Top notch battle sequences.2) Likeable hard-ass mythical characters. (My sister is wrong - Aragorn does have the edge over Legolas in my opinion.)3) An awesome CGI character to keep you amused.My one criticism of the trilogy thus far is the musical score. It's only okay - it needs at least two more easily identifiable recurring motifs. Anyway, that's my only gripe - who cares whether it's really elves or pixies or spirits of the forests who come to the rescue at Helm's Deep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have any doubt as to the greatness and critical acclaim this movie is receiving, then take a look at this site. If you just click on any movie, and then look at the left side, you will see all the years movies, with wide release movies on top, and limited release movies on the bottom. TTT had a average score of 90. The only wide release movie that scored higher was Lion King. But if you click on it, you will see it has a pathetic 3 reviews (it was probably shown on IMAX or something) Anyways, is Lion King anywhere near the best movies of this or any year? Of course not. Hey, I like animated movies too, but Lion King? Come on, gimme a break.It is quite surprising that no other movie even scored in the eighties. In fact, the next highest rated movies were 8 Mile with Eminem and Punch Drunk Love (have no clue who's in the movie), both with 78. Catch Me If You Can scored 75. Lilo and Stitch scored 76. Solaris and the much ballyhooed Gangs of New York both only scored 70. Those are the ONLY movies in the 70s.TTT is not just the best movie of the year. It was the best movie BY FAR. I think the stupidity of those who have a low opinion of this epic masterpiece is made even more evident now. Face it losers. You're wrong.

		<shortDescription>Too many changes for me to enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of LotR for a long time now, and after reading it through several times as well, I was disappointed with the changes that were made in this installment of the movie trilogy.I feel that the changes made in this movie didn't help in any way to advance the plot, nor make it easier to understand for people that have never read the books. Certain changes are unforgivable in my mind as well (Changing the noble character of Faramir in the books, to something along the lines of Boromir = totally unnecessary). Once again PJ has expanded the role of Arwen, to my chagrin. However, including her part didn't change any plot points in the story, which I guess I can accept.The numerous changes to the Helms Deep side of the story (Saruman controlling Theoden,and Eomer's exile; just to name a few) while being minor in some cases, are still totally unneeded. Why on earth did they create an elf army to help out?!?!?!?!?I will admit that PJ was able to handle the duality of Gollum/Smeagol quite well. He was one of the few parts of the movie I truly enjoyed (Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise being the other).While the battle sequence was neat in parts, the unfortunate comic relief that they included irritated me greatly. There are only so many times you can throw in a dwarf tossing joke into a movie (and so far they've had 2 too many, including the one in Fellowship).I can see how this movie would be enjoyable to people that have never read the books, but I believe that Tolkein fans worldwide let out a universal grumble at many of these changes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a great lover of all things Tolkien. I have also long been a fan of Peter Jackson. And this movie is truly spectacular - a genuine epic. I am 34 years old and I still felt like a wide-eyed kid while watching TTT. The feeling reminded me of the first time I saw Star Wars when I was about 10. In fact, I would say TTT was better.I have read a number of reviews that have criticised this movie (and FOTR) for not sticking precisely to the books. Big deal! Had the movies simply been a page-by-page, visual version of the books, each movie would be a rambling 7-hour mess. As any good film-maker will tell you, any book that is brought to film needs to be reworked to accommodate the different medium. This is especially true of a work as involved as LOTR. It is this problem of translation from book to film that has been the undoing of other fantasy movies (eg: Dune). Bear in mind also that Peter Jackson has made a film for millions of people who have never read any of the books - not just for those lucky enough to have read LOTR (or even The Hobbit). So yes, TTT the movie is slightly different from TTT the book. Does that disqualify it as a valid interpretation of Tolkien's work? Hell NO!! Be grateful that it was made by a genuine Tolkien fan, and not by some third-rate Hollywood hack. If you want to get an appreciation of how much time and effort Jackson and his team put into making the film(s), watch the special features on the extended DVD edition. I doubt there is another director alive who would have invested so much of himself in the project.Having said all that, what was the movie like? Amazing! Better than the first installment, and that is saying something. Cinematography, sound, music, characterisation, plot development, continuity, special effects (especially Gollum and the battle at Helm's Deep) are all first rate. But similar comments could perhaps be made about Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Yet TTT is (in my humble opinion) far superior. So what separates the two? Soul. Spirit. Passion. I enjoyed Episode II, but I got the feeling Lucas was just going through the motions, pumping out yet another installment. But TTT has an energy that is palpable, and I believe this is due in part to the dedication of both cast and crew (especially Jackson himself).More experienced and technical eyes than mine will no doubt find fault with the film for a variety of reasons. But I give it a strong 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite popular opinion, this is fairly appalling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am fairly disgusted at the level of near-godly praise this film has had. While The Fellowship of The Ring was a fairly decent (even better on the extended DVD), this film is actually mostly awful. After the opening explaining more-or-less what happened to Gandalf in his battle with the Balrog, Peter Jackson treats us to 90 minutes of incomprehensible drivel. The camera swings in his trademark "sweeping" shots so much it feels like a spoof of the first film, and then randomly lurches between the three groups of protagonists. There is little congruence, and the story is not even attempted to be told in any clear fashion.Then there is the acting, which fails to live up to the standards of the first film. And the Ents. Ah, those tree-creatures that I could not visualise when I read the book, their appearance remains a mystery still. They look terrible. Like the worst kind of stop-motion they do not look natural or tree-like, and they are not even produced very well on screen. They look appalling. As if to make matters worse, Mr Jackson has insisted on expanding the parts of the elves to give them roles in this film when they were barely even mentioned in the book. Why, I do not know.Fortunately the film gets better as we get to the centrepiece: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yes, this does live up to what you have heard, and will undoubtedly go down as one of the finest cinematic battles to date. Shame that it is intercut with scenes of the ents.Then, the worst thing about the film: no ending. The film just seems to stop, and it does so a full SIX chapters before the book. This is unbelievable. The Return of The King isn't THAT short a book to warrant getting a third of The Two Towers tacked on the beginning of it. I really cannot understand the reasoning behind why Peter Jackson expands some parts, but then misses out nearly a third of the book. And why were Frodo and Sam taken to Gondor? That never happened in the book either.I really think Peter Jackson should actually read the books to the end. What's next? FOUR LOTR films?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more to the Dark Side...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... the dark side of computer graphics, that is. By this I mean that this movie has in common with the latest installments of Star Wars (and, undoubtedly, with an increasing number of Hollywood blockbusters) that the only character worthcaring about and, yes, the only "acting" worth noticing, is computer generated: there Yoda (and the two robots), here Gollum.As evidenced by the previews preceding the movie - all, with one exception,sequels or prequels of some kind, with a special mention to "Dumb andDumberer" (!) - this is also one more movie that people will watch for what it promises, not for what it delivers - it pretty much doesn't matter what you see, if you liked the first one (as you probably did unlike you get dragged into thesecond, as I was, against your own will) and/or liked the book, you'll like this too.All in all, this is a perfect no-brainer as (some people claim) only Hollywood can make, where plot and characters are replaced with grandiose scenery, specialeffects, fights, noise and furor.What I found most disturbing is, in addition to the racist undertones common to all of Tolkien's work (a simplistic world where one's character and almost every action is dictated by their "race"), the obvious pro-war propaganda(miscellaneous and coincidental maybe, but still remarkable) conveyed by aplot whose center theme is the necessity - no, the beauty and holiness - of(some) wars. Although understandable from someone who wrote (maybe with a clear visionof what the near future would bring) in the late 30's, the clear message that "sometimes", delaying war is a fatal mistake appears here, with Evil itself as the enemy, in the simplistic form which has been used so many times - and still is - as an excuse for random, unwarranted acts of aggression. In a story where any kind of deep meaning is hard to find, stumbling upon this one is particularly disturbing in the current political context.</fullReview>

The characters are incredibly boring or predictible: there is no hero, no frightened but courageous people, no desparated quest, no impossible mission because everything is so obvious. The evolution of Gandalf is explained with five words and it's over. The battle is such boring than you laugh when Gimli says few bad jokes and just after you feel ashamed about it. The Ents are the most efficient way to sleep I've never seen; the scene in front of the Mordor's Gate (when they hide themselves with their coats) is unbelievable (even if the explanation will be found with the third movie); Faramir's behaviors have no sense, and Legolas isn't a fighter, he's a surfer!Fast food, fast movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK feature, though not without it's problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that I'm not a die-hard LOTR person. I've never read Tolkein's books and basically thought that the first feature was at best OK. So this review will be from a movie fan's point of view rather than a hard-core Tolkein fan.Frankly, I did find this to be a little more involving than `Fellowship'. It had some truly wonderful visuals, (it should win the Oscars for those) and though I'm not a fan of CGI, Gollum is one of the better digital creatures to come out of the movies.Still, I did have some problems with the picture. First off, many have said that the characters are all well developed. Well, I didn't see it that way. For me, any character development really took a back seat to the special effects. Sometimes that's not a bad thing, if handled correctly. (Ray Harryhausen's movies are a good example of that). But when people start saying that these guys should be nominated for Academy Awards, oh come on now! Frankly, the most interesting character by far was Gollum and he was a digital creation!Secondly, like the first feature, `Towers' has it's moments where it really drags, especially during the middle. Peter Jackson, I think, kept cutting in an out of the many different stories this movie had and as a result some of the focus was lost.The final battle scene was spectacular, but then again, Jackson makes the cardinal sin of running it too long, and as result a lot of the intensity is gone. One of the professional reviewers said that not since Akira Kurosawa, have we seen any battle of this magnitude. Well, speaking for myself, this battle comes no where near Kurosawa's fighting scenes. Kurosawa's battle scenes were always wonderfully intense from beginning to end. (And he didn't need digital fighting characters).If I were rating this movie film solely on its special effects, I'd give it 3 ? stars. But when the whole movie is added in, I'd have to give it 2 ? stars. Just like the first feature, `Towers' is an OK movie, but because of the character Gollum, I found it a little bit more entertaining.Anyway that's my take on this film. It's funny how people view things differently. Many hard-core fans view these two Lord of the Rings features as the greatest all-time cinematic masterpieces in film history, (which is perfectly fine) while I myself only found them mildly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished reading about 20 reviews that praised this film to no end. I am astonished. Please, take it back one and all.Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying this was a terrible film, or even mediocre. It was a good film. Stronger than most films. But it was so pale in comparison to the first one. Fellowship cleverly blended action, epic grandeur, and down to earth emmotion. I felt like I knew the characters of the fellowship. So Pete changed a few elements, it bettered the story. It flowed well. It was paced well. It gave us a chance to care for the characters and at the same time understand the intricacies of the plot of the film. This I was expecting from the Two Towers, and it seems like it was all thrown out the window, which baffles me since this film was shot interspersed with Fellowship.Towers suffers, in my opinion, from overkill in the postproduction sessions. Whoever was helming this portion lost sight of how to treat an audience. I have not read the book, so I don't care about changes, I care about story structure. Do I understand what is happening, do I get to know the people, do I care for them when they are in peril? This is all a product of pacing which I feel was sorely lopsided in this film. Characters fundamentally changed. Gimli was not comic relief in Fellowship, why now? I wanted to breath more with Eowyn. She seemed like such an amazingly strong character, but we're with her less than two minutes and she's crying and she's a mess and we're suppose to feel sorry for her, and I don't even know who she is. Peter's strength of sticking with people in Fellowship, of just giving them some conversation to let us trust the characters, to let us want to pull for them is lost in Towers. It's cutticy cut all over the place. We never stay with a single shot for more than a few seconds. The scenes with Frodo, Sam and Smeagol are the only ones I felt connected to the characters. I know this was a three hour film, but I think there was entirely to much time spent on setting up fight scenes and special effects. We understand there is a war coming. We can conclude that Helm's Deep is going to get it's booty kicked. We could have had half as much fighting building up to Helm's deep and twice as much character development so that when the fighting happened, we really did care about the outcome and not whether this scene looks as real as the last one.Another thing. This film had no structure. No beginning, no end. It was just three hours of middle. Now I understand that it's the middle book, but it's still a movie unto itself. Again, I just think whoever was in charge of post work was staring at it for so long, he was unable to objectively see whether or not the film was paced right, whether or not the characters were developing, whether or not character's introductions were faithful to the character's initial performance. I mean, thanks to poor editing, Faramir was a joke.On a plus note, most of the acting was well done(although I do think editing is responsible for choosing some innappropriate moments of humor in the middle of an intensely dramatic scenes, which undermined any power the scenes may have had). Of course, the 2 hours and 45 minutes of special effects are amazing(but we could have used less), and the music is spectacular-- Kudos to Howard shore for an amazing score, the theme for the people of Rohan is breathtaking with it's keltic fiddles.So, people, don't empower Pete. Don't let him make the third film with even more special effects and less dialogue. We gotta make sure he's gonna give a spectacular closing chapter. Let the characters become the center piece of the story once more. And it's up to us to tell him that. No more thoughtless praise of all the special effects. Lets crack down. We want a good movie with people we care for. All of us together now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too many plot lines, evil not menacing enough, bad computer graphics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of this movie were exciting. But there were at least four big problems:1) The movie follows three sets of characters: Frodo and his buddy; the humans who are attacked by the army of orcs; and two hobbits who are lost in the forest. Since these sets of characters have their own separate story lines throughout the movie, there are lots of jumps. And only one story line is any good: the humans battling against the orcs. Everything else is just distracting.2) The first movie is good largely because the evil characters, especially the horsemen, are so believable and menacing. In this installment, the bad guys are laughable -- buffoonish orcs by the thousands, a crazy Christopher Lee stuck in a tower, etc.3) The computer graphics in this movie just aren't very good. Golum is a great character but, whenever he comes onscreen, you can't help thinking, "hey, that guy's a cheesy computer graphic." The computer effects in the last scene involving torrents of water are like something out of a bad Godzilla movie.4) As much as I like Sir Ian, his White Gandolf seems stoned in most of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Director Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. Even with Two Towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. By the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. A lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. It's like being in the middle of a mile run. You glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. Since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just OK. In my opinion, The Two Towers is just alright. The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. It is book III: The Treason of Isengard and IV: The Journey to Mordor AKA the Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East in the book series. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's Fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. Instead, we get a cool new intro with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) fighting the Balrog monster from the last movie. We come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. Frodo (Elijah Woods) &amp; Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey and meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the way. Gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. Andy Serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion CGI capture acting, I ever saw. Since, there was a decision to leave Shelob for the third movie meant that Faramir (David Wenham) had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam's journey. This change was indeed different than the book. It does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. Frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. His real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. This resistance is Frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. It had some pretty powerful symbolism here between Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I do have a problem with Frodo &amp; Sam's friendship. I have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. It's obvious Tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so I don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. While this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) find themselves fighting the Orcs invasion at Helm's Deep and helping the war-torn nation of Rohan. While in the book, Helm's Deep is a small battle. In this film, it's the big climax of the film. It's one of the best battle scenes in film, I ever witnessed. I can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of Orcs without much battle scars. I can do without Legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. I couldn't stand Gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. Also, glad to see Arwen (Liv Tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside Aragorn. I can still do without Aragorn's life is now tied to the Fate of the Ring bit. It makes little to no sense. I understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. The movie is more about Aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) &amp; Pippin (Billy Boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike Ents and trying to stop Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army at Isengard. Environment themes are question here. Still, the whole Treebeard part were a bit boring. One thing, I hate about Lord of the Rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. Aragorn, Frodo, and others. As much as I love seeing Gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. For him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. I blame it on Tolkien. I didn't like the whole Jesus Christ metaphor with his character. Besides Boromir (Sean Bean), does any main character dies in this movie. The movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. Everybody seems nearly invincible. Water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. Gandalf, Aragorn, and Frodo were save by large bodies of water. Similarly, Saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. Like a baptized, it's free from sin. Even the elves depart Middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. The film has a lot of Christianity themes. The music by Howard Shore is amazing. Overall: Good visual film that can be a bit confusing. Just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When One Thought It Couldn't Get Any Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A+Definitely among my personal favorite films, LOTR 2 is as good if not better than the last one. Now the main reason why it's better: story is already in motion thanks to the first film. Secondly, just a whole lot less of those damned Hobbits. Still, there are some funny moments, like Sam uttering "Your Sam." I don't know if it's a running gag to insinuate this almost romantic relationship between the two, but it shall pass (kudos to McKellen). Thirdly, the sense of doom created by the images is quite awesome. The acting was once again class A work, and there were some interesting new characters. I particularly like John Rhys-Davies as TreeBeard, and loved Andy Serkis as the twisted Gollum. Plus David Wenham was great as always. Orlando Bloom's character delivers plenty of action, quite the bad-ass really. And Gimli of course was the ever constant comic relief. He does get to kick quite bit of ass despite all this, so it's a okay in my book. Once the action starts, it never lets up. And Peter Jackson's cinematographer doesn't let us down with some amazing cinematography and breathtaking shots. I mean the end battle is truly one to remember and was probably among the most epic battles in fantasy history. The amount of time, craftsmen, and effort put in by the production team and cast is definitely worthy of note. The Battle at Helm's Deep will surely go down in cinematic history as one of the most beautifully orchestrated climaxes ever. Howard Shore's score isn't as dark and as menacing as it was in the last film, but still very, very, good. And so with all this, a very good film is born worthy of recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible second part; surpasses the first even</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once I had finished The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings I immediately watched The Two Towers, because I was so interested to see what was in store next for me in this wonderful epic. I found the first to be very good, which I didn't think I would, but this was way better, and it surprised me how much I enjoyed both films and how interested I was in the story.Of course since it is a second half it starts of where the first one finished and right from the very instant of the beginning of the movie I was drawn in and it had my total attention. I'm not big on these types of movies and as you can tell I absolutely loved this! It was a very, very, very satisfying installment in the series and a great way to make you completely interested in seeing what is in store from the third one. Plus, I loved how they brought in the character of Smeagol and how daring and cool all the new battle sequences are. This was excellent, as well as the whole trilogy, and it was so well done and entertaining that I couldn't help but put in the third part right after for more excitement and magic. Job well done, indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," continues the journey to destroy the Ring of Power. Frodo, and his companion Sam journey to the Fires of Mordor, with the creature Gollum at their side. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow a band of Uruk-hai and Orcs, who have captured Merry and Pippin and are taking them to the evil wizard Saruman, who also has the king of Rohan under his spell.This all seems clustered, yes? Well, fear not, because it's all very good, all the way to the end. Once more, Peter Jackson serves up some great visuals and story as we see so much turmoil with the characters. Many messages are brought out, but I will not talk of them because you'll have to figure them out yourselves. Please see it; it's much better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something special about the Two Towers that makes it more enjoyable than the other two parts of the trilogy. That is not to say that the other two films are inferior in any way, I just am simply more entertained by this one than the others and this is a large part to due with the Battle of Helms Deep. The Battle of Helms Deep is simply one of the finest battle sequences ever in movie history. Though not only is the battle exquisitely crafted, but thanks to Peter Jackson's wonderful direction, he makes us feel for the heroes and makes you want to continuously jump up and cheer each time Aragorn mows down a row of orcs, or Legolas rides a shield down a flight of stairs, pummeling enemies with his arrows on the way down. Still the battle is not the only thing that makes this film more enjoyable. I felt for these characters more so in this film than any of the others. Part of that is because this film puts more focus on the characters and who they are than either of the other two films. In the first one it was all about exposition, the third one it was all about drawing it all to a close, but this one was all about getting to know the characters better so that by the time we reach the third film we are so emotionally attached that we could not bear to see any of them pass.Overall Two Towers is a terrific film and is easily one of my more favorite movies of all-time.I give the Two Towers a perfect 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Of All Time-Part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another fantastic layer to the film is the art direction, which is not only elegant and organic at times, but rugged and industrial. It also fabricates a realism into itself that creates infinite impact on the audience.The cast is also very good, they play off each other perfectly, different nationalities keeping each character fresh and interesting. Due to the huge number of characters in this film, I will only mention the most notable performances: As far as Hobbits go, Elijah Wood gives us a brilliant transformation from a wide-eyed innocent to a paranoid ring-junkie. Sean Astin gives us a beautiful portrayal of boundless friendship and unlikely courage. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd provide delightful comic relief when together, compelling character development when apart. Ian Holm has only a small amount of screen time, but in it he is incredibly memorable as Bilbo. Ian Mckellen is powerful as Gandalf, as well as providing hope and exposition along the long journey. Now we come to the miss-matched Three Musketeers: Viggo Mortensen is powerful, rugged, and tortured as Aragorn, where as Orlando Bloom and John-Rhys Davies are both simply awesome when they get to play off each other. When it comes to Sean Bean as Boromir, during the course of the story, he does a villainous deed, but we still feel sympathy for him, as we do for his younger brother, Faramir, played to perfection by David Whenham, who strives to please his father by emulating Boromir. I see no reason why John Noble, who plays Denethor, the tragic, corrupt father of the two sons mentioned earlier, should'not receive an Oscar for his Shakespearean performance.The film also holds its own brand of visual amazement. Combining fantastic lighting that further effects the tone of a particular scene, elaborate sword fights that give each character their own method of fighting, incredible action scenes including a single warrior climbing a giant elephant and single-handedly taking him down, 2,000 horses sliding down a hillside, a giant staircase falling down a chasm, a man and a fiery beast fighting while falling miles down a tunnel into an underground lake, and a mile-high tower falling and exploding on it's way down, and dynamic camera moves, that include something of a roller coaster ride through massive tunnels, a minute-long shot of a moth flying over a tower, or a pan past a mile-high life-like statue of a forgotten king.In a film with so much spectacle, CGI is expected, but here, not even noticeable. Giant monsters, CGI sets and landscapes, and fabricated armies, all flawlessly integrated into the film by a computer, looking as real as if they were all there right in front of the camera. But for all the films technical achievements, they hail in comparison to one: Gollum. His movements are flawless, his voice perfect, his amazingly realistic flesh tones breathtaking. Whether you hate him, pity him, or identify with him, is your decision. The film portrays him in such a way, unbiased, unprejudiced. But one thing we can all agree on, he is quite simply, one of the greatest technical achievements of all time.</fullReview>

This film draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. The fact that the actors were not nominated for Oscars is appalling! If Elijah Wood is not Oscar worthy they need to quit giving the damn things out! For the people that don't "get" the Lord of the Rings and why it's so great, this thing is NOT complicated it's a story of human emotion and the struggle between good and evil so I don't understand why that is so confusing...maybe some are just to shallow to understand those things. My 9 year old nephew gets it so trust me it's not complicated. Lord of the Rings is just simply a great work of art and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on the greatest film ever made, there is nothing else to compare, not even close</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part in the Lord of the Rings installment is a great masterpiece. In fact, all three movies are masterpieces. I believe that this film is slightly better than the first one. In the Two Towers, Frodo and Sam are being led to Mordor by the beast, Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hunting Merry and Pippin, are involved getting Theoden of Rohan away from Saruman's control, and fighting Saruman's Orcs. Gandalf is better than ever in this film. He is not dead as we all assumed. Gollum is great in this film. Andy Serkis should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The CGI is amazing, so amazing it makes Gollum appear life-like. I liked Treebeard in this film. He serves as a mentor to Merry and Pippin. I liked the chemistry between Legolas and Gimli. They provide comedy in perilous times of Middle Earth. The acting is excellent especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen. Howard Shore continues with his captivating music. The effects, especially the visual effects are great. This is truly an epic. The whole theater was on it's feet doing a standing ovation when the end credits rolled along. If you haven't already, see the Return of the King. I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in 2003, before the release of Return of the King. Of course I had already seen The Fellowship and loved it. I found Two Towers to surpass it. Upon viewing Return of the King, I felt it was the best. Now I find myself saying Two Towers is the best because it is a much stronger film that 3. I hope I'm not including spoilers, but the battle of helm's deep was more exhilarating than minas-tirith, Gollum was better (not visually but spiritually) that in 3, and above all it had a sad and slightly depressed feel compared to the other films. Even though Return of the King is a great conclusion for the series, Two Towers is a better film with more emotional depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Two Towers" is the finest of the epic trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I do cherish and enjoy all three epic parts of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, I do prefer "The Two Towers" over its prequel and sequel films. It's not as cleverly made as the first one, not as heart-wrenching as the third one, but it is overall the most powerful of the three.What mostly motivated me to give it a 10/10 was the fact that it is the only one of the three films where I can sit down and watch the entire film without thinking "This could've bit just a little bit shorter". That was the reason why I only gave the other two films 9/10, because they were a little bit too long to keep me fully interested in their three-hour runs. "Two Towers" is also three hours long, but it has the energy and motivation that can keep me interested to watch the entire thing without thinking afterward what scenes were expendable."The Two Towers" has the most action of the three films, which is one of the biggest reasons why I can stay entertained without getting the slightest bit of boredom throughout its running time. And the final hour of the film has one of the most epic and well-made battle sequences ever brought to the big screen.All viewers need to see the Lord of the Rings trilogy in chronological order, but "The Two Towers" is the best of them all. Great performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, and all the others involved in this masterpiece. Good job, Peter Jackson. This is your second-best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Epic Film-making (Part 2--Even Better Than FOTR)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackson's second film installment of the JRR Tolkien trilogy is large in scope and vision. It is truly a great cinematic experience--rollicking good fun, scary monsters, human themes, and big battles. This film delivers the goods many times over. In my opinion, it is better than the first film.This one does not center on the Ring. It centers on Aragorn's journey to Rohan--a horse kingdom--to warn its leaders of an onslaught of Uruks sent by Saruman to conquer them. What follows are some of the greatest and most exciting battle scenes ever put onto screen.Peter Jackson directs this with the same type of style as was in the first movie--big, sweeping shots, lots of VFX, dark lighting, bombastic and rousing music. And it works just as well in this movie as it did in the last. The script is far better than the Fellowship's script. It is much more flushed out, much more interesting, and has a lot more action. I like it! The acting is on par with part one. Ian McKellan gives the best performance out of all the actors. His return as Gandalf (the White) is memorable. While not as likable a character in this movie, he still serves as a wise, all-knowing and powerful figure. I repeat, he is NOT the grandfatherly figure he portrayed in the first film, but a wise, lethal wizard that is strict and on the nose.The rest of the cast is great as well. John Rhys-Davies serves as some much-needed comic relief. His performance as Gimli brings a lightness to the film (a film that basically coincides with The Empire Strikes Back). Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn brings a gritty and badass-type of quality to his character. He is more fleshed out in TTT than in FOTR. Orlando Bloom still plays the pretty boy elf that has a great CGI stunt double. I daresay the girls in the theater were drooling over him.Overall, a worthy, if not better, installment on the trilogy. Epic film-making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly my Favorite out of the 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still find this my favorite one even though Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments).Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got "ambiguity" and "unreliability" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two persons, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his "preccciousssss" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.</fullReview>

Something like this will never be seen again. This is a must have for everyone of this generation. There is no movie lover in this day and age who has not viewed this film at least once.

		<fullReview>Like the fellowship of the ring, this movie is great in almost every level. It is as good as it and as well it's good in different kinds of ways. It's really hard to to a second part of a trilogy and make it just as awesome as the first and better in certain ways as well. Peter Jackson definitely has talent in his directing and you can definitely tell when you see this movie.The special effects are better than in the fellowship of the ring and the stories keep jumping around from the different people at different places. It takes off right where the fellowship of the ring left off focuses very heavily in each and every one of the characters in their different paths. The story is excellent and the acting is wonderful. Andy Serkis as gollum takes away this movie with his excellent acting ability for doing gollum's voice and stuff. There is a battle scene in this movie that is just unbelievably well done with outstanding visuals and special effects.This is continuing the great trilogy of the lord of the rings and making everybody just dying to see the return of the king. I can't I absolutely can't wait for it to come out. It's gonna be the closing to the trilogy and gonna be and awesome ending to it as well. Frodo started changing and becoming more effected by the ring in this one so he will probably be even worse in the last one. The battle for middle earth will be absolutely incredible and it's definitely gonna be at least as good as the other movies in the trilogy.This is an overall stunning movie. Lord of the Rings are my favorite movies and I think a lot of people will agree that this is the best movie of this year and the best movie anybody has seen in a long time. A great movie full of even more wonderful creatures, special effects, an equally good story line as the first, great plot and character development and even better acting. A little less adventurous than the first but not by too much. Still an equally good movie and my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better. Should have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe anyone who read Tolkien's masterpiece will be disappointed with this second installment of the trilogy. If you haven't read the book though, then this movie may be pure entertainment.Why I don't like this movie? First of all it is not completely true to the story (you can very well argue it doesn't have to be), and unfortunately the additions made by Jackson and his screenwriters consist of childish, cliche scenes or dialogues. The new lines sound like they have been written by Kevin Costner rather than Tolkien.The action scenes are exaggerated and overacted (with Legolas surfing down the stairs on a shield while firing arrows etc etc). The characters are all the time overcome with emotion, which toward the end of the movie makes you sick (Why is Frodo on the verge of tears all the time? Why does everybody hug and cast meaningful glances at each other every other minute?).The background music gets to my nerves after the first hour. There should be a substitute to this Nordic chorus singing at extremely high pitch whenever something grave happens.And then, back again the changes in the story are unforgivable for someone who loves the book. The removal of some parts of the story is, of course, necessary. But fiddling with characters (Oh Faramir!) is not.What you have is a Hollywood blockbuster based on a great book. I guess it could have been worse, which is the only good thing I have to say about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing near as good as the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the summary points out, I didn't find the two towers nearly as enjoyable as the first episode. Reasons for this are I believe quite obvious: The two towers is a mix of many things and tales and fails to grab the audience in the manner the first one did. In FOTR you felt enchanted as we were treated with beautiful images (and emotions in particular!) from the shire and from along the journey of the fellowship.In TTT there is really no single plot. The movie consists of the combined tales of different characters and groups and they fail to connect. Even Gandalf, who in the first was a loveable wise man has become more of an action oriented character. In FOTR for ex. you could see Gandlaf pondering matters of great importance, and then find out that his wise decicions were based on a better odor in this corridor than the others. This kind of subtle humor and intelligence is missing in the second film.Acting is excellent, as is everything else - technically. Soul and feeling is what is absent. And the ring. The ring is all but gone, it just hangs on Frodos neck.Having said all of the above, I still liked the film quite a bit. It's just not as good as the first one, which is obviously the only film you can really compare this to. I give this one 7/10, which is a good grade. (as a side note, I suggest users would learn to use the FULL range of votes, instead of always giving tens to movies they happened to like a bit).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype. A very average film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I should say that I think that The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing film and is quite easily one of the best films of the new decade. I also think that Peter Jackson is a great director, so my expectations for The Two Towers were huge. Unfortunately the film failed to deliver in so many ways.The biggest flaw is the script, which is almost no better than the abysmal episode 2 script. The trilogy has gone from being darkly epic to fun for all the family. For example, the only purpose that Gimli seems to play in the film is to add comic relief. This is okay for a while, but his one liners soon become extremely irritating and only truly funny to the most stupid of film-goers. Aragorn has become very bland, but you can't blame this on Mortenson who does the best he can with the throw away script that he is given. As well as the script a lot of the acting is shockingly bad. Sean Astin yet again proves himself to be painful to the eyes and ears. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are both awful (what idiot cast these films?). Even Ian Mckellen is average. Christopher Lee could've been good, but Jackson decides to only give him about three lines. Bernard Hill is far to young to play Theoden (again, casting issues!).As for the special effects, it would seem that Jackson has taken a leaf out of Lucas's book and gone cgi crazy. The beauty of Fellowship was that cgi was kept to a minimum, but at times The Two Towers is a horrible computer generated mess. Why computer generate the forest of Fangorn? I'm sure there must be at least one forest in New Zealand to fit the bill. But, the ents destroying Isengard really took the biscuit for badness. The whole scene just looks cheap and nasty. As for the battle of Helm's deep, the special effects look really good, but the whole scene is ruined by awful script, dreadful pacing, rubbish fighting (did they actually train the actors how to use those swords?) and a lack of continuity.Fans of the book are saying this film is bad because it strays so far from the original text. Essentially I don't have a problem with changing things if it means the narrative will flow better. But it doesn't. The films pacing is abysmally bad. I realise this is Jacksons 'intepretation' of the books, but it is a very average one at best. What really p***es me off is the way all the critics are patting Jackson on the back and saying that The Two Towers is even better than fellowship. Someone needs to stand up to this guy and tell him that he has done bad things. If Jackson or any of the cast receive oscar nominations I will be absolutely disgusted. I could go on and on with this rant, but I won't bother because my review is only going to become lost among a sea of other reviews claiming The Two Towers is one of the greatest films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I anticipated this film like none other, and was not disappointed. I believe the LoTR trilogy to be the greatest of all time and of course this movie was brilliant in all of the same ways that the first one was. In this review I will not list all of the good things about this film because there are too many, although the adapion of Gollum was breathtaking and wonderful. That said, I did have some complaints.1) In my opinion the battle scenes were not as cool as they could have been: too much hacking and slashing not enough impressive feats of strength and dexterity.2) Gimli was turned into a walking punchline. While it was very funny and provided moments of comic relief, I think he should really be more of a badass than a comedian.3) Distorting the book. I know this is bound to happen but Jackson did it less in the first movie.That said, it was an incredible experience seeing this movie. Not a perfect masterpiece (like the first one) but an absolutely worthy successor.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New hideous beasts join the Balrog and Orcs as audience members return to Middle Earth during Director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and five other members of the original Fellowship continue their arduous journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring. Conditions are often intolerable. Powers clash and collide. The battles are fierce and unrelenting. Friendships and alliances are tested. Innocent people and brave warriors lose their lives. Love is found and lost and unreturned. The world is simply a darker place. But even this enormous amount of conflict and drama does not engender a superior sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The team of screenwriters (Frances Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and Peter Jackson) undeniably undertook a difficult task in reproducing J.R.R. Tolkien's epic in script form, but this fact does not excuse the film's slow pace and occasional incomprehensibility. Both major and minor characters are introduced too quickly and little or no time is invested in many of these people, which prevents audience members from connecting and sympathizing with the characters. Théoden (Bernard Hill) orders elderly men and young boys to fight an impossible war, but one cannot connect with the weeping women or terrified men as leaders outfit them in helmets and swords and send them off to a likely death. The writers have not given audience members the time or reason to care.The overriding theme in The Lord of the Rings is that the good in the world is worth a tremendous fight and that evil cannot prevail despite its overwhelming force, but other themes evolve through various characters and subplots. Few people can miss the dominating theme; Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) even states this Truth at the end of The Two Towers just in case it has eluded anyone in the story's first six cinematic hours. Unfortunately, many other themes are lost not simply because of exclusion from the original text, but again, because the writers did not invest enough time in explaining the details and significance of certain events. Allowing Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) to return momentarily to clarify certain points and clever monologues by Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis) avoid complete disregard for intelligibility, but more of these not-entirely-innovative but nonetheless helpful techniques would have benefited the film.Gollum embodies the possibility that any inherently good creature can be transformed into something evil. The entire cast delivers laudable performances once again, but this computer generated character steals the spotlight in every one of his scenes. He appears deformed and acts maliciously, but the writers gave him a tremendous amount of depth and so his deformities and deviance is forgiven. Gollum is complicated, and he is endearing. He has become a slave to the desire for power, but traces of his former Sméagol self penetrate his dominating ugliness--especially in an intense but entertaining forest monologue.Unfortunately, Gollum also represents the most disturbing reality of the second part of this film series: The Two Towers relies too heavily on its computer generated characters and special effects and not enough on the story and the abilities of its human actors. Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) prances off boulders and dramatically flies onto a horse during battle, which elicits laughter during serious moments and detracts from Bloom's natural ability to play the part. The Fellowship of the Ring is not entirely void of these non-human creations, but the focus is on the nine-member Fellowship. The actors are responsible for the overall success or failure of each scene in the first film, but the exact opposite is true for the second film and pure spectacle does not afford cinematic greatness.Jackson's talented cast is not as present in The Two Towers, but they make a valiant effort to carry the film even through too numerous sweeping landscape scenes. Still, few of the actors exhibit flawless or even nearly flawless performances. Wood and John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli, occasionally overreact with melodramatic reactions and facial expressions, though it is admittedly the exception to Wood's otherwise skillful and intriguing performance. Rhys-Davies is particularly guilty of this amateurish act, however, and these poor acting choices coupled with a script that portrays him as a fool cheapens the overall story and discredits the Fellowship. The most troubling acting problem, however, is the lack of chemistry between the lead male characters excluding the hobbits. Every single leader is captivating in his individual monologues and scenes, but their camaraderie seems forced and unauthentic. The camera does most of the work, and the actors rely on background music and other visual effects to compensate for their collective inefficiency. Thankfully, the believability of all other relationships balances this inadequacy, and newcomer Miranda Otto as Éowyn shines.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers lags behind its predecessor, but Jackson and his cast and crew have created another film well worth the price of a movie ticket. The story begs for more explanation and the actors are undermined by technology, but the special effects and computer generated characters will keep audience members content through the three hour duration. One Ring was forged to bind all creatures in the darkness of Mordor--despite the film's faults, don't be the only one to miss this continued journey that will determine if the dark prophecy will come true and send Middle Earth into catastrophic ruin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an Odyssey of three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most good flower children, I read the trilogy, but I cheated and read the Similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. First, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than JRR did, and JRR used a lot of words-three big books. Tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. Now the movie. In this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the Bridge on the River Kwai holds the children in us in interest with Hawkins, Holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. Likewise, the scenes with the interaction of Frodo and Samwise with their enemy-guide Gollum, captivate the viewer. The little bits of humor with characterization, such as when Samwise cooks the rabbit. Gollum responds "Oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!" That whole bit is priceless. No wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing Gollum if the movie ever came out. A role you could literally get your teeth into. A delightfully depraved character. The adventures of Merry and Pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. They play a minor role, and it is directed as such. The adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. It makes sense that Gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of JRR's world from the beginning of time. One wonders why he can't actually do more. However, why some smart Uruk Hai doesn't just slice off Aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. The battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. Never does Aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. The bit where Wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. But the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. All in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. Quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Direction Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did they have a whole sequence where Aragorn is thought to be dead and that dumb elf (or the thought of her) brings him back? Why add something so useless and completely non-Tolkien? Who cares about adding "touching" scenes for the superficial walking wallets? Tolkien's books became classic and popular without all that garbage. I don't think Peter Jackson did a horrible job on the trilogy, and in fact, I think he produced a great silver screen interpretation of the series. However, I believe that he really fouled up the middle of this movie. Its true that the book trilogy does not have much involvement for women, but there is no reason to add it now. It was completely unnecessary to add the whole Arwen romance spin. I don't remember reading it in the books. If it was in the books, then it was so insignificant that I merely forgot it. I only recall Arwen being mentioned in the end when they are wed (in a somewhat political wedding). (I've been told there is more to Arwen in the appendices, but I never read those, and they are appendices for a reason: extra and unimportant) In fact, they actually cut out some of the only "romance" that Tolkien actually put in the story. Faramir and Eowyn spend quite a bit of time together while recovering, and that is where they begin to fall in love. If it was so necessary to have romance in this series, why not emphasize that part? This is probably because it didn't occur until the third book, and some Hollywood money-maker thought it would be better to develop a romance from the beginning to draw people in. I know this may seem like I'm some Tolkien die-hard who will not like anything but the books, but I'm not. I love when books and movies coincide. However, I HATE when money (instead of artistic integrity) dictates production values. If you want a clearer view of what I mean, read Michael Crichton's The Lost World (sequel to Jurassic Park) and then watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot express the joy I felt when this second installment of Lord of the Rings hit the screens. My joy was short-lived, however, as I discovered that this second in the trilogy was as painful as exercising on a push bike with diarrhoea.The first of the trilogy was an excellent film, even for someone like me who isn't a big fan on there so-called 'fantasy epics'. Did no one mention to Tolkien that he'd just rewritten the Conan Chronicles, with the only difference being that he couldn't even be bothered to make more female characters? Okay, so we know Tolkien must have been gay for that reason. No matter. The film of the first book was spectacular - battle scenes like I'd never seen before, dialogue that was crisp and sharp, and I really felt for the characters.The Two Towers was just the opposite. The fight scenes were nothing new - in fact, if they had taken out all the fight scenes, there would have been nothing left in the film! I'm very disappointed that they didn't make this film more dialogue-driven rather than effects and battle-driven. Granted that the book has numerous battles, to me this translated badly onto the cellular screen. For me, films must be ADAPTED from books, not merely copied scene-for-scene.One person commented that this film require a new scale because 10 cannot do it justice. Erm, 10 means perfection; and as far as I'm concerned, no film ever deserves a 10. The Godfather comes close, so does Star Wars (episode 4), and perhaps Casablanca.Watching the Two Towers gave me the same feeling of disappointment that I felt when I watched Matrix Reloaded - it put me off wanting to watch the final installment. Which is a shame, because the last of the trilogy (both Matrix and LOTR) is much better than the second of the trilogy in both cases.In terms of 'completeness', I would recommend watching this film only because you need it to bridge the first and third LOTR films. If you want to watch a film purely for its entertainment value, you're better off watching "I, Robot". At least you get to see Will Smith get beaten up many times lol.The Two Towers scores a generous 3/10 for me, only because you need it to watch the far superior final installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but ultimately disappointing esp. if you have read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geek alert - this is written by a fan of the original books. If you never read them, my guess is that you won't find this review very illuminating - I just had to get it off my chest :-)After being completely swept away by the amazing Fellowship of the Ring, this was a disappointment. I completely agree that there must be changes when a book is made into a movie. In the Fellowship of the Ring, most of Jackson's changes to Tolkien's tale were judicious - to diminish the amazing number of subsidiary characters somewhat (substitute Arwen for Glorfindel), even to cut out long sequences made sense to keep the length of the movie reasonable (no Old Forest) since there really wasn't one minute I would want to cut from what was actually in the movie.Not so with the Two Towers. Many of the most exciting scenes from the book are gone or altered beyond recognition and in their place are long and (I hate to say it) boring sequences which don't further the plot or anything else.{spoilers, film and book} * The book's fight over Merry and Pippin between Sauron's and Saruman's orcs, essential to why the book and the movie is called the Two Towers, is completely gone. * The unexpected beauty and courage Frodo and Sam according to the book found in Ithilien on the threshold of Mordor are in the film changed to depict violence and power abuse. Faramir's role in the movie is instead a quick and superfluous recap of Boromir: He wants to use the Ring, but in the end he comes round. * In the film Frodo here comes face to face with a Nazgul - but if Sauron thus knew the Ring was just outside Mordor, he probably wouldn't march on Minas Tirith, as he (I presume) will do in Return of the King. * The added scenes include Aragorn being left for dead and dreaming of Arwen, who is being bullied by Elrond into leaving Middle Earth. This seems completely pointless, and I find the added scenes with Arwen annoying to a degree that makes me root for Eowyn as Queen of Gondor. * Another added scene is Haldir arriving at Helm's Deep with an elf army out of Lorien - this may seem to be a detail, but it changes the story on a fundamental level, so instead of being about Man rising to the challenge it becomes Elf going out with a bang. Also, it contradicts the opening sequence where the voice-over (quite rightly according to the book) states that the defeat of Sauron by Elendil and Gil-galad was "the *last* alliance of Man and Elf". * Another change for the worse is to the Ents. First of all, Fangorn brings the hobbits to Gandalf to ask him what to do. Would the leader of the most ancient species do that? Second the Ents' decision of going to war. In the film, the Entmoot is a joke - it goes on forever because entish is a very slow language (as in the book) but they decide not to do anything (unlike in the book). However, when Fangorn sees the trees felled by orcs (how come he didn't know about that already - he is after all tree-herd of the Forest) he can suddenly give a lot of information in a single shout and in the blink of an eye all the composed Ents are suddenly marching to war. * Then there is the film's crude exorcist scene with Theoden. That would have been a lot more effective if it had been more subtle. And I sorely missed the dialogue between Theoden, Gandalf and Wormtongue which is among the book's finest. * Lastly, we see nothing of the book's growing, unlikely friendship between Legolas and Gimli. Instead Gimli is only in the movie as comic relief. A movie needs comedy, but maybe it could have been distributed a little more evenly so a whole character didn't have to be eliminated. {end of spoilers}Besides these alterations to the story, I just found the movie long and at times boring. Where its predecessor jumped from one amazing scene to the next and almost seemed too compact (I enjoyed the extended version even more), for all its battle scenes this movie is at times almost at a stand-still.All that aside, Jackson continues the most vivid and captivating visualisation of Middle Earth ever. Gollum is really spot-on. The viking theme chosen for Rohan works out well. This movie gets 6 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge improvement over the first installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. It was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. The second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. The cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. The plotline of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas defending the people of Rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. I'm actually glad for that, as I'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. I turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. Pippin and Merry, the two Hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. This plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention.The third plotline, the one with Frodo and Sam, is by far the most interesting. Gollum, the former owner of the ring, now obsessed with it, attacks them and is captured. He soon becomes their guide when Frodo begins to sympathize with his downfall. Gollum is by far the most interesting character in the film, like Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back. This is the first computer-generated character to work completely. Except for his eyes, I'd accept him as a physical entity. And his story and performance are just so tragic that these parts were nearly overwhelming at times. It's too bad they don't award voice characterizations (and I can't find who did it on imdb). The special effects guys really, truly deserve to win an Oscar for their work here. He was so interesting, I wanted the whole movie to be based from his point of view for a lot of the film.Fortunately, the other two stories do begin to work after a while. There's a great, kinetic battle scene with some wolves that was apparently not in the novel, which, of course, angers all the nerds. This leads to some material about Liv Tyler's character which was also not in the book. My LOTR nerd friend admitted that these scenes were good, and, in my mind, that was the first real scene that got me to give the slightest care for Aragorn, who seems so important but, to me, seemed so uninteresting in the first movie and a lot of this one. The elf and dwarf also begin to come into their own, although the dwarf is often used solely for comic relief, and it's not especially funny. A lot of the movie focuses around a huge battle fought by these characters. They have armies now, so this battle scene is much less ridiculous than the ones in the first film. It's actually enormously entertaining. Pippin and Merry also become more interesting, although they're never going to be, I fear, as interesting as anyone else. The ents whom they hang around with are really cool, though. The ents' attack on one of the towers (I do have to admit that I didn't even realize there were two myself) makes for a very neat scene.My biggest complaint is about the same as my biggest complaint about the first film. Why are the villains so boring? The orcs and their kin are just dull, faceless villains. They're fodder for the good guys' armies. They run around and yowl, and that's about it. Why can't there be a few generals or something that have interesting things to say? Christopher Lee, who did make a bit of an impression in the first film, is totally shafted in this one. He does little more than sit in his tower and watch his troops march away. There's also a new villain, an Ozzy Osbourne-looking guy named Wormtongue, who is controlling the king of Rohan with magic. Do you really believe that they would allow a guy named Wormtongue to come into their palace, let alone advise the king?Despite this film's numerous flaws, I can't think of another film of 2002 that really entertained me more than this one. 8/10.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, as does Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is as great as its predecessor and successor. Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen.

		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers, simply put, is a travesty of monumental proportions. This may sound like a tired cliche but so is the production of this movie. The sheer arrogance to mess around with the greatest story put to print is unbelievable. The changes in the story and characters go far beyond interpretation and seem to suggest that Mr Jackson simply feels that Tolkien got it wrong. Peter Jackson's movie embodies all the disdain that Tolkien had for Hollywood, but I guess the money makes it easy to live with, and he claims to be a fan. Read the book, miss the film.

		<fullReview>** some spoilers ahead ** most of the people that did not like this picture did so for the wrong reason. it is not that jackson has been unfaithful to the novel. he has, but who cares? david peoples and ridley scott have changed much more from the excelent "do androids dream of electric sheep" than jackson changes from lotr, and they made "blade runner" an outstanding movie. no, the problem with jackson is that the movie is boring. the battle of helm is too long, the characters are dull and torpid, our interest for the story goes downhill for three very long hours in which nothing interesting happens. besides, every single thing jackson changed from the novel was way worse than the original, from the ents scene (barbol does not know what is going on in its own wood, doesn't he seem stupid) to the elves showing up in helm's deep to the total debasement of faramir's nature, to the exorcism of theoden (why didn't they cast linda blair for the part? at least she can make her head spin!!) not one character gets even our simpathy. it seems that the director did not believe in the tale he was telling, or in the characters in that tale, or did not care. if for some reason frodo were, all of a sudden, reduced to fine powder by a sausage grinder, no one in the audience would have cared.maybe the director was too worried being topically faithful to the novel to be able to take control and do a good movie, or even a mediocre one. he has nothing to say on his own, and he is unable to "transcript" what tolkien said, and as a result the movie does not say anything at all, and is just a concatenation of bland scenes and tepid acting, full of sound and fury, with nice cinematography and great art direction.as someone said, great artists take what they find grandly, like conquerors, minor ones take like petty thieves.</fullReview>

I sat down on a Saturday afternoon and watched them together finishing later in the evening.While I still enjoy the cinematography, the makeup, FX, costumes and the acting, I enjoy the direction less. I'm less enthusiastic of the added excessive fluff to the story so they could stretch it out over the three installments to make more money.The entire Trilogy could have been edited down to (2) movies with (3) hours each. The fluff could all be thrown out and it wouldn't hurt the trilogy at all.

		<shortDescription>Inferior, but still worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The adventure continues with two separate stories (readers of the book will notice that the stories have been sandwiched together): one with Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Bloom) on the trail of orcs who have kidnapped hobbits Pippin (Boyd) and Merry (Monaghan); the other with Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) making their way to Mordor accompanied by troublesome guide Gollum (Serkis). No longer obscured by the shadows, Serkis almost steals the movie when brought to the foreground. While undeniably more action-packed than FELLOWSHIP (fans particularly love the intense Helm's Deep battle), this movie is really the start of the corny-lines and moments-of-boredom that plague the rest of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Hill and Otto are frustrating as the hope-driven king and princess of Rohan. Regardless of how disappointingly inferior it is compared to FELLOWSHIP, it makes for an excellent story-bridge between its predecessor and the following RETURN OF THE KING. TWO TOWERS is still a pleasure for Treebeard (also voiced by Rhys-Davies) and the ents.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely it is seen that sequels manage to keep up to the originals, generally heavily criticized by the fans of the original. But The Two Towers is a gem of a film and a jewel of a sequel. Nor does it go astray, neither it looses its pace. It is as beautiful as the The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. Also as beautiful as the book itself.Frodo and Sam continue with their quest and are finally united with Gollum, meanwhile Merry and Pippin finally get to play their part in the war. Aragorn and others fight to protect the Rohirrims from the armies of Sauruman's Uruk High.Just like the fellowship of the ring this film excels in breathtaking Cinematography, sound, original score, make up, set designs and visual effects. Also the character design, creating a haunting and pitiful Gollum, straight out of the book, I wonder if Tolkien actually wanted Gollum to be like that? Also It's superbly digitally acted by Andy Serkis, who reaches new heights of digital acting.The film also has some superior character development as it further sketches the characters of previously Un-scketched characters like Frodo, Aragorn and too some extent Legolas. Eoweyn brings in a good deal of famine element in the movie. According to the book, Ents are the most sluggish or boring creatures in the middle earth, and Jackson made sure to make their parts 'boring' (A little tongue in cheek).Direction: Flawless as before.Script/Screenplay: Strong and superb.Acting: I feel sad the Andy wasn't nominated in any major award ceremony, he was superb. Elijah shines too. Others are convincing.Music: Extremely good, though not as good as the Fellowship but still great and haunting. Its a delight to see how Gollum's last scene blends into Gollum's Song.Overall, not a movie but an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, "one ring to rule them all." The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord.One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power.Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about.Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. "I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf," Gimli says in the final battle. "How about side by side with a friend?" Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and na?ve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters.These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie.These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies.Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Centerpiece of Pete Jackson's LOTR Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone said in another review: If you are not entertained by this movie then it is not possible for you to be entertained. A Vision appears in my mind of Russell Crowe shoving two huge swords into a guys gut and then lopping off his head while screaming "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?" As this film is the centerpiece of the most complex Trilogy ever made (even more so than "Avatar" Which Weta also did the majority of Computer Graphics for)... Then the problem lies with the viewer, not with the Filmmakers.And for myself after watching this film a multitude of times in both Theatrical and Extended versions plus the hours of extra material, I feel that Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens, Fran Walsh, Barry Osbourne, Rick Porras, Howard Shore, Jamie Selkirk and all of the cast and crew of LOTR are all personal Friends of mine who have visited me in my living room whenever I've watched the extras. My favourite person is Gino Acevedo, the Prosthetic makeup artist who did Limbs and Gollum's digital "makeup" - And he was one of the "Pirates" in Return Of the King.. Don't know why, I like the way the guy describes his work, I can get along with someone like that. There was also a woman, she was only shown a few times but I was impressed, did all the motion capture for the digital hordes, Carrie Thiel: Also modeled all the moves for the Massive Agents, quite deft and professional, and she looked like she means business. Christian Rivers... The Miniatures Unit, they can come to a party at my house ANY day, I owe all of these people. Each person who worked on LOTR was a consummate Professional, chosen for specific jobs... Even Alan Lee, hired as conceptual artist along with John Howe stepped out of his slot to assist Dan Hennah with the set decoration, so these people did a lot of multi-departmental work. The atmosphere must have been something to see! Insane artists designing the Witch King's Spiky Helmet! These people made a permanent dent in me and I'll never forget them, I'll remember them forever.The most amazing sight is our first view of Edoras as Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas ride up... Which was a real place that existed for just Six Months, the most convincing set ever built for a movie. "You'd find more cheer in a graveyard", Gimli grimly offers as they ride up... These films were made in the midst of a time of great upheaval and change, just as the characters face in the film: Pippin tells Meriadoc... "Maybe we don't belong here, it's too big for us, besides, We still have the Shire" - Whereas Meriadoc rebukes him, telling him, "The fires of Isengard will spread, The woods of Tuckbourough and Buckland will burn, and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone... There won't BE a Shire". Our choice is to make our world good or bad: So I challenge anyone watching this film to let this be a cautionary tale - How would you like your world? And Ironically, Weta Digital also worked on another film which makes the same statement... "Avatar". Do we want to live in a world with NO Brazilian Rain Forests or African Jungles or Polar Ice Caps? We cannot live without these things, they are necessary for our survival and also the survival of our precious animals, our most valuable resource. And so we stand at a crossroads and we must go up the Morgul Vale to the Dead City and up the secret stair through Shelob's Lair and right into Mordor. And we can't stop there, then we have to wade through troops of Orcs and then up a volcano that keeps threatening to erupt! And then it DOES erupt, so then we get to surf on huge Rocks and then if we are lucky we can catch a ride on the next Eagle that flies by... Perhaps Lord of the Rings is a Prophetic Story, Prophetic and representational of us today, although Tolkien never wanted it that way.Considering this is a landmark film using brand new MoCap tech, the computer graphics meld into the practical and miniature sets perfectly. I KNOW there is no "Warg Attack" in the book, and in the book we do not get a troop of ELVES showing up just in time to help defend Helm's Deep and Legolas never takes a Skateboard Run down the outer steps of the deeping wall, but Jackson made the best Lord of the Rings he was able to make and thank The Lord Bob Shaye shelled out the money to make this, and in Three films... And the story is basically intact, so please no complaining about no Gandalf fighting the Balrog Under the Mountain! Peter Jackson interpreted Lord of the Rings for us, and handed it to us on a platter. But if all you have seen is the Theatrical version of all of these movies, then I can say with authority, you really have not SEEN Jackson's Lord of the Rings - So go out and rent you that Extended Cut- Soon to be released in Blu-Ray HD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The middle film from Middle Earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is my favourite film from the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts with my favourite scene of the trilogy?Gandalf's breath-taking battle against the Balrog in the bowels of Middle Earth; ends with the best action scenes of the trilogy?the epic battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard; and features many of my most memorable moments from the trilogy, including Gollum's schizophrenic conversation with Smeagol, a hilarious discussion between orcs about whether they should eat Merry and Pippin, and Legolas shouting 'They've taken the hobbits to Isengard!' (check out the dance music remix of this on YouTube?it's hilarious!).A few minor niggles prevent me from awarding The Two Towers top marks?the rather slow scenes with Treebeard in Fangorn, Legolas surfing down some steps on a shield (a portent of the excesses of The Return of the King), and the fact that it took me three viewings to completely understand all that happens?but on the whole this is an excellent film. Did I mention it was my favourite of the trilogy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another epic masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson comes back with such a fantastic and epic masterpiece. The thing i love about the second instalment is that it has a slightly darker tone to it which is very captivating. We go from "The fellowship of the ring" where we see Frodo as an innocent hobbit and all is well with the world but now we progress into the tale we see the effect the ring has on everyone,things start to deteriorate such as Frodo and Sams relationship, especially with the involvement of the sneaky and deceptive Gollum (and of course because of the ring) which is interesting to observe. The narrative is more complex as the fellowship has split so we follow Frodo and Sam, Aragon and the gang and Merry and Pippin which is interesting as they all have a connection yet they are not together. You see as the film progress Yet again peter Jackson and the writing team make another success with this film and yet again there is nothing offensive with this film which is what most films could do with. Amazing acting from the whole cast. I love the ending as it is a chilling ending giving the audience a little something but giving us the rest in the third film. Another epic masterpiece form the amazing Peter Jackson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I'm a LOTR fan, and this movie is my favorite film out of the three. Even though some Frodo-Sam-Gollum, Merry-Pippin scenes were a little bit boring, the final hour compensates it all. I think it's one of the greatest battle sequences we have seen in the last 10 years, it keeps you at the edge of the seat; the directing, the location, the acting, the music, even the rain, it all comes perfectly together to make us feel the chaos, the high, the rush that the characters experience. I've read the books (after watching the films), and I have to recognize that there are a lot of episodes missing, but it is for the best; Tolkien created a whole new world: culture, languages, thousands of years in history... it is impossible to put it all in a movie, but the very essence of the books can be seen on the big screen. So, kudos for the writers.Going back to where I started, maybe the first two hours are a little slow, but those 60 minutes at the end make the ticket worth it, it is EPIC; and it is deep story too, because it's not all about whether they are gonna lose or win the war, it's about friendship, loyalty, inner strength, going against the odds, this is a good movie because the characters have a soul, they are not hollow (like Avatar).Love this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the fantastic Fellowship of the Ring we wait a year to finally get Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Just like the first this film is just fantastic. The acting is still great, the writing is still great, the characters are still great, and it is even more epic. It is just great. Many people consider this to be the weakest of the 3 films, but I think that this stands with the first in excellence. In this film we are introduced to Gollum. Gollum is the thing that most people remember about this film. His visuals are fantastic, and the character's split personality is commonly parodied. This great film continues the trilogy, and sets us up for the great end of The Lord of the Rings.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gandalf is SUCH a badass! Wizard against Balrog in a film opening so power-hammering it is astonishing that writer-director Peter Jackson didn't score a cross-promotion roller-coaster ride at Universal Studios called The Falling Balrog.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS opens at the middle of the last film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), as our friends (hobbits, men, elf, dwarf and lots of poo) flee through subterranean caverns, pursued by a towering flaming demon that only Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has the 'nads to face down. When he thunders at the advancing Balrog, "YOU - SHALL ? NOT ? PASS!" and thwacks his staff upon the stone floor (in a sound which any comics fan should know is written as "KRA-KHOOM!") it is every superhero personified and every man-fantasy of impressing chicks combined.Then they both fall.There is that "falling" metaphor passim in Tolkien's writing. (Only to rise again - the Superman trope, which is Nietzsche's Ubermensch, formerly Christ's resurrection, which in turn was plagiarized from every life-death-rebirth deity that came before, from Asia to Akkadia.) Later, Aragorn is swept off a cliff by a wolf, and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reports to Eowyn, in a poignant moment that is moving as much for Rhys-Davies's throat-catching performance as for his words, "He fell." When Gandalf is resurrected as Gandalf The White and thwarts the surprise attack of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (what a badass!), Aragorn, dismayed, says to him, "But you fell..." Even the ultimate fall of Gollum into the lava in THE RETURN OF THE KING, though it means the death of that poor conflicted special effect and the destruction of the One Ring, signifies a "rebirth" of Middle-earth.TWO TOWERS is where "that gangrel creature" Gollum (motion-captured performance by Andy Serkis) comes into his own, in a mind-blowing, pioneering special effects coup for WETA Digital, Peter Jackson's efx company. Like an evil Gandhi on crack, Gollum allies with the two star hobbits, Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) on their quest to Mordor; they go to destroy The One Ring, Gollum goes for any opportunity to reclaim the Ring, his "precious." Thus opening a new era in effects creatures interacting with humans on screen. The sight lines between Gollum and the hobbits never falter, and when they engage in physical contact, their interaction is so "real" we never doubt it, watching the movie completely entranced by its story rather than marveling at Gollum's "reality" or how his scanty panty never falls off.In THE TWO TOWERS, all our friends from the previous film wend their separate adventures in a dynamic, kinetic story full of middles. Being that TOWERS is - ahem - Middle-earth's middle film (the red-headed child of Peter Jackson's nonpareil RINGS trilogy), it very sensibly has a middle, more middle, lots of other middle, a legendary medieval battle that will stamp itself into filmic history, and more middle.Frodo and Sam find Mordor with Gollum's help, decide to backtrack and find it again from the other side; the fruity B-hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) stop being carried around by orcs and get carried around by a tree; the Nazgul have graduated to riding excellent bat-winged dragons with VOOMP-VOOMP! wing-beats; sexy Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), his blonde elfin babe, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and their husky child Gimli, run around the countryside, presumably in search of a good hot shower; while the mighty Gandalf slays a Balrog, drives the spirit of Saruman (Christopher Lee as Edgar Winter) out of Theoden King, and leads a cavalry charge on the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep - what a badass! So many characters, so many strands of plot, yet Jackson holds it all together with an iron grip that never flags - from its broad battle strokes to its poignant personal relationships. Jackson focuses maybe a little too much on Aragorn pining over his elf-boo Arwen (Liv Tyler, with pointy ears that just scream "Do me Elf-Style!"); add Arwen pining over Aragorn in slomo and whole chariots of tiresome love butter clog this film's arteries. (And it's hard to sympathize with Aragorn missing his pointy-eared woman, when Eowyn (svelte Miranda Otto, a shield maiden of Rohan) is bursting all over him like a romantic raincloud.) Left for dead, when Aragorn arrives solo at Helm's Deep, a grand, sweeping 360-degree pan frames him, in a scene befitting a resurrection, and necessitating the invention of big screen plasma TVs.There is only one way to describe The Battle of Helm's Deep, which somehow does not lose us in its madness, conveying clearly the pitch and yaw of victories and defeats, focusing on every character involved yet encompassing the grand scope of the madding war tableau... actually, there is NO way to describe it. Just watch it. I don't know how he did it, but Jackson keeps us hanging in suspense and excitement during every minute of what most other filmmakers usually turn into generic rumbling. A truly incredible feat of direction, editing, choreography and creativity.I wonder what a Tolkien scholar would think of THE LORD OF THE RINGS?Jackson rewrites certain plot points for drama, but cannot escape broad strokes: so 10,000 orcs are sent to decimate 300 people? If Saruman just ignored this veritable "village" he could still rule Middle-earth pretty much without any resistance.At the end, while a montage of battles cascades before our wondrous orbs, Samwise Gamgee gives one of those speeches that makes your flesh crawl, whereupon the hobbits share a moment so romantic we feel we shouldn't be watching them.And just like the movie, I'm going to end in the middle--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always considered 'The Two Towers (2002)' to be the black-sheep of the "Lord of the Rings" family; still completely amazing, of course, but perhaps less so than the two instalments that bookend it. Whereas 'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' is an episodic introduction into the breathtaking world of Middle-Earth, and 'The Return of the King (2003)' is the climax to which the entire trilogy builds, 'The Two Towers' has neither a concrete beginning nor end. On initial viewings, the film seemed to centre on the Battle of Helms Deep, an epic conflict that pits a few hundred men and elves against Saruman's 10,000-strong Uruk-hai army.If the theatrical cut of 'The Two Towers' lacked the narrative depth of its siblings, then the Extended Edition ? which I watched this week for the first time ? rectifies any such shortcomings, breathing new life into the lands of Rohan, Gondor, and their human inhabitants. Most significantly, Faramir (David Wenham) is given a back-story that makes clearer his motivations, via an extensive flashback featuring his father, Denethor (John Noble), and brother Boromir (Sean Bean). The newly-introduced characters are no less three-dimensional than their more familiar counterparts: Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, Saruman's grovelling, serpentine apprentice; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, a pro-feministic noblewoman lusting for glory; Bernard Hill as Theoden, the King of Rohan, and possessed by the treacherous hand of Isengard.Unlike its predecessor, 'The Two Towers' is split into three parallel story lines, but once again balances the epic and intimate, abruptly (but never jarringly) cutting between the epic battles of Aragorn and Co., and the slow, tortured trampling of Frodo, Sam and their slippery little guide (played by Andy Serkis in a rotoscope suit). I recall that, when the 'The Two Towers' was first released back in 2002, Gollum was the main focus of reviewers' attention, and I was pleased to discover that the technology utilised in the CGI-character's creation remains completely authentic and convincing. Serkis, despite never actually appearing on screen, brings an astonishing depth to the character, highlighting Smeagol/Gollum's schizophrenia by subtly altering his voice, posture and mannerisms.I'm about to take another trip down memory-lane, so bear with me again. When I first saw 'The Two Towers' at the cinemas ? in the last week of 2002 ? I remember telling a friend that I preferred the first instalment, because it was "more about the ring." While it's true that the second film somewhat relegates Frodo and Sam's struggles to the sidelines, one must consider the bigger picture. 'The Two Towers' takes Tolkien's Middle-Earth beyond the guise of a simple fantasy world, and, with its vast scope and attention-to-detail, almost convinces us of its historical authenticity. I still recall emerging from the blackened cinema satisfied with where the trilogy was heading, but horrified at the prospect of waiting an entire year for the story's conclusion. Well, I waited... but no longer than I had to. At least I'll only be waiting a week this time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the good things that The Fellowship of the Ring started, The Two Towers continues without a hitch. Sometimes the middle part of trilogies can be the weakest, but that's not the case here.The viewer is introduced to more of the world beyond the Shire, including Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and Mordor. All these locations are crafted with as much care and skill as the Shire &nbsp;and Rivendell.The best parts of the movie are Gollum and the epic Battle of Helm's Deep. Gollum is still my favorite CG character in any live-action movie, even several years later. He feels just like a living, breathing character. And as for Helm's Deep, it's hands-down one of the most impressive battle sequences ever in a fantasy film. Top notch in every way.So basically, if you liked The Fellowship of the Ring, you'll probably like The Two Towers even more.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but what about the start? And the end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central part of Peter Jackson's 3 part adaptation of Lord of the Rings suffers, inevitably, from the fact that it doesn't have a proper beginning (unless you watch Fellowship of the Ring immediately beforehand) or end (unless you watch Return of the King immediately afterwards).What it does have, however, is Gollum, an extraordinary creation to the joint credit of voice and movement artist Andy Serkis, dressed up on screen by the amazing work of Weta Digital, Jackson's in-house digital effects team. What results is what, at the time, was the most convincing wholly digital on-screen character yet seen. Even more extraordinary, the movie Gollum acquired an element of pathos which his creator seemed unable to give him on the page. Gollum's actions are driven by evil - Gollum himself is tragic: Tolkien said this, but I think he must have disliked Gollum, because I always felt that he was unable to translate the truth of this onto paper. Yet Jackson and his team manage to.This film, ultimately, though, chronicles the trials and tribulations of the separate elements of the Fellowship as they move onwards, introducing the Riders of Rohan on the way, and culminating in the epic siege of Heml's Deep, something of a smokescreen to conceal Frodo, Sam and Gollum creeping quietly ever nearer to Mordor.As with part 1, the casting, performances, pacing and look of the film are flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the theatrical release I liked Two Towers but not as much as the other two. Only on watching all three again side-by-side did I truly appreciate what a great film Two Towers is - better late than never. It is tightly paced and probably has the best character development of all three. I did always think the changes that were made from the book were cinematically for the best as the book drags the most. While it is also the only extended edition I thought really added quite a lot to the story (although there are some great moments in the other extended editions), the theatrical version is still an exemplary piece of film-making. I urge all those who dismiss Two Towers as 'the black sheep' of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, to give it another go in context of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Cooper's performance in 2002's Adaptation was skillful and memorable, but the Academy Award for Actor In A Supporting Role should surely have gone to Andy Serkis for his performance as Gollum in the second part of Peter Jackson's seminal movie trilogy. The Two Towers (correctly) received the Visual Effects gong, but the Academy may have missed a trick - we couldn't have felt pity for poor Smeagol without the Englishman's dazzling talent.The Two Towers is the heart of the story in Jackson's (and Fran Walsh's, Philippa Boyens', and Steven Sinclair's) take on the tale. The book has been seriously and necessarily rejigged to suit the demands of the classical narrative. The battle of Helm's Deep, for instance, has been promoted beyond what was essentially a precursor to the final battle to something more immense: a grand, emotionally-driven climactic battle which represents arguably the best single action encounter of the trilogy.But this last stand would be nothing were it not for the quality of the drama that precedes it. The Fellowship of the Ring set the scene; The Return of the King tore the scene to shreds on an awe-inspiring scale. The Two Towers, meanwhile, sows the seeds that will bloom into the enthralling narrative conflicts concluded in its sequel, as well as containing numerous character arcs of its own. The reluctant feud begins between Boromir (Sean Bean) and Faramir (David Wenham) for the love of their father, Denethor (John Noble); the adversity between nature and industry, represented by the mighty Ents and the tyrant Saruman (Christopher Lee), comes full circle; Grima Wormtongue's (a particularly superb Brad Dourif) fleeting power over the troubled king Theoden (Bernard Hill) and his adopted son, Eomer (Karl Urban) is a wicked war waged by an opportunist weakling. And I haven't even mentioned the surviving members of the Fellowship...Pleasingly, Jackson et al continue their exploration of Arwen (Liv Tyler), as well as introducing another prominent female character. Miranda Otto's Eowyn is spiky and obstinate, and yet hauntingly bereft; a pale ghost wandering the prison of her uncle (Theoden). She's the most interesting female character in the series by far, deservingly foregrounded for the latter two movies.Epic, exciting, heartfelt, and frightening - this is a brilliant hub for the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers continues the Lord of the Rings epic where the first film finishes and does a brilliant job.This movie plays a much bigger role in helping the viewers to get to know the characters better. Much more background is provided for Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli are explored in much greater detail. Merry and Pippin have some of the best scenes and Tom Bombadil is indirectly referred to. The realisation of the ents on screen is stunning.Once again Peter Jackson's eye for selecting a great cast is demonstrated here brilliantly. Casting Orlando Bloom in particular was a huge gamble but it paid off magnificently. Brad Dourif is perfect for the role of Grima as is Bernard Hill.The scenes at Helm's Deep are probably the hugest scenes in any film ever made but what you see on screen is nothing short of spectacular.The only gripe I have is Legolas sliding down the steps on the shield. This looked a bit silly to me but it is only in the film for a few seconds so it doesn't really spoil anything.Simply amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring exceptions were sky-high. Peter Jackson undertook an epic production, shooting all three Lord of the Rings back-to-back and making the most epic trilogy ever. Here Jackson makes an ever more epic film, and make it even better then the first.After the events of the first film, The Fellowship of the Rings has broken, Boromir (Sean Bean) has been killed by Orcs, Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) has been killed by a Balrog, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have taken the Ring eastwards, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) had been captured by Saruman's (Christopher Lee) Orcs, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are on the chase. Things look bad for the free people of Middle-Earth, Saruman and Sauron have formed a powerful alliance, and the King of Rohan, Theoden (Bernard Hill) has fallen under Saruman's spell. The three groups take their own paths in the quest. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum (Andy Serkis), the other creature who craves the ring. He is only creature that could lead Frodo into Mordor, but Sam has an obvious distrust for him. Merry and Pippen end up escaping from the Orcs and hide in the forest of Fangorn. They end up meeting Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies), an Ent, a peaceful treelike creature. It is up to the hobbits to help inspire the powerful Ents into conflict against Saruman. Aragon and co. end up finding out that Gandalf has been resurrected as an even more powerful wizard. Gandalf leads this part of the Fellowship to save Theoden and to go to war with Saruman's forces.The Lord of the Rings books are one of the best fantasy books around, with a complex story and a long history. It would have been difficult for another to convert them into films, and many people were attached, from the Beatles in the sixties, to even the great Stanley Kubrick. But Peter Jackson manages it by making 3 long epic films (even better with the extended cuts), with top of the range special effects. He ensures that the films is as loyal as possible, whilst ensure that a wider film audience would enjoy them. The Two Towers follows the premise of book, and there are only a few scenes that are changed. Jackson follows many of the key themes, like Treebeard's resistance to fight, with Treebeard represent nature against the tide of industrialisation of Saruman. They is also Gollum's longing for the ring and how it takes it's toll on Frodo. There is also Gollum's schizophrenia, a brilliant element in both the film and the book. Jackson's direction is excellent, creating a serious tone for the most part, about the darkness that the ring brings, the tough conditions of war and travelling a medieval style world, and the excitement and dangers of adventure. This is a world where people die, a dangerous, dirty world. But Jackson does know when to lighten the mood, with some moments of comment, mainly from Gimli, and have brilliant actions scenes. The Battle of Helms Deep is one of the best battles put to screen. Jackson shows he is one of the best director's around, mixing, action, drama, comedy, and excellent special effects. The costumes are brilliant, and the design of Gollum is fantastic. Despite all this, the film does deviate from the book unnecessarily, like an action sequence when the men of Rohan fight Wang (wolf) riding Orcs, and Aragon disappears because of it. But the main problem is with the characterisation of Faramir (David Wenham). In the book Faramir is depicted as a kind lord, a good leader and a fine warrior: he knows of the corrupting influence of the ring, so doesn't want to know anything about it. In the film he is depicted a much darker light, showing him to be a harsh person, willing to use brutal methods, and tries to claim the ring for himself. This was not needed, and the only real dark spot for the film.The cast is terrific. Viggo Mortensen is of course a great actor, who plays Aragorn was brilliant, so was Andy Serkis as Gollum. There are obviously talented actors like Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Christopher Lee, Sir Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, who all do well in their roles. Sean Astin grows, turning Sam turns from a slightly stupid character to someone who becomes more worldly wise. The film also helped kicked-start the careers of Karl Urban and David Wenham.A brilliant film, the extended cut is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set straight after the 'Fellowship', we witness the dark power of 'Sauron' begin to reach out from 'Mordor'. Merry and Pippin have been taken by the Uruk-Hai, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are hot on their trail. Frodo and Sam with the help of Golum continue their journey towards the volcano of Mordor. And an old friend returns.More importantly, Sauron has waged war on the people of Rohan and now the fight begins at 'Helms deep'.I personally think that this is the greatest of the trilogy, as we the audience now know each character and are thrown deep into the war for 'Middle-Earth'.The actors all provide great performances, each captivates the audience and more importantly allows other new actors to take centre stage, Eowyn, Faramir.But I strongly feel that it is the work of 'Peter Jackson' that prevails above all else, you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen. The tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the Uruk-Hai bring with them from the main characters. I felt that the battle at 'Helms-Deep' was executed magnificently, you felt each rain droplet, each roar, each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monsters.Throughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it; giving the film a wonderful quality.Truly magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THe second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers, is almost as good as the original. The only problem with it(it's no big deal) is that there was battle after battle after battle. THey're entertaining, no doubt. But there isn't as much story to it. THe second is a direct sequel to the original. In the end of the original, Sam and Frodo escaped on a boat and began their journey to destroy the Ring. Merry and Pippin were kidnapped. Bormear(Sean Bean) was just murdered. In the sequel, Sam and Frodo(Sean Astin and Elijah Wood)have begun they're journey. Along the way, they meet the freak of nature Gollum(played by Andy Serkis). Gollum says he can take them to Mount Doom, where they're to destroy the ring. I won't tell you anything else. Because you've either seen the film or is going to see the film. I don't want to spoil too much because a ton happens in the second one. Like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince, this film leaves you pumped for the final installment. The entire world was. The Two Towers is one of the best of 2002. If you're expecting a lot, then you'll get a lot. THe Two Hours doesn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serkis shines in Jackson's stunningly dramatic war sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) continue their quest for Mordor with the creature Gollum (Serkis) for company whilst the rest of the Fellowship fight Sauron's army.The sequel to the worldwide phenomenon The Fellowship of the Ring brought a record topping audience into theatres to see the continuation of J.R.R Tolkien's trilogy, and this second instalment is equally terrific as its predecessor with Peter Jackson maintaining a sweeping styled directional approach and a stunning conceptual plot.Jackson astounded many with his first release, being appreciative of the story whilst containing some of the fiercest fantasy sequences to grace our screens since George Lucas' Star Wars, and here he arguably beats his previous release.The Two Towers brings out the first major battle of the series with the Battle of Helm's Deep that reinvents the concept of war and the power the New Zealander has. Zack Snyder's strongly choreographed battle sequences in 300 brought an altogether new concept to CGI battle sequences which, brilliant as they were, didn't have that vigour of Jackson's conceptual approach. For example, these battles encoded are strongly realistic, for seeing everything as it should be. Though there is heavy amount of computer input, there are by far greater approaches and efforts to make this appear as if we are right there in battle.There is so much happening from heavy marching and formations to strong battering boulders, entwined with heavy character drama and political concepts that balance this 2002 smash into consistent realism.The beginning is wildly a strong part of Jackson's game. The Fellowship opened us up sweetly with explaining a sombre and mystical legend with the third film opening with Gollum's arrival. Here we have a stunning twist that reawakens the biggest dramatic event of its predecessor that instantly grabs our attention and puts us in high anticipation as familiar faces once more grace our screens.We see Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor and the initial interplay between the pair is repetitive conceptual dialogue from the previous release but once the pair admit to being stalked does the temperature change, and what a change.Andy Serkis was knocked back for an Oscar nomination as his character Gollum is a CGI creation despite Serkis' heavy input but there is no denying the presence of the Englishman in this picture, winning fans with his two faced character ranking up the tension and interest. The manipulation and dark desire are beautifully intriguing.The plot is consistent, if not quite as springy as the Fellowship. There is a heavy amount of politics encoded as we dive deeper into the story which gives great appreciation for the novels as Jackson once more proves he was the man for the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, one of Peter Jackson's greatest works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is, in my opinion, Peter Jackson's best movie up to date. The Fellowship of the Ring was also really impressive, though. I recommend this to those who are fans of LOTR and I think it definitely shapes the gap between the start of Frodo's quest and the epic ending of the third movie. This is a story with emotion, action and adventure, one that grips the viewer in the world of JRR Tolkien and engages them in the story. I was blown away, and I think many others will too. It's kind of like the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy in a way. In Star Wars: Episode 2, the finale was the Battle of Geonosis and that started the clone wars. In LOTR; The Two Towers, the finale was the Battle of Helm's Deep and that started the War of the Ring.A recommendation to almost anyone who favors movies and fantasy 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tremendous battle at Helm's Deep, amazing CGI Gollum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers is my favorite film in the Rings trilogy. It is darker than 'Fellowship' and contains more character development than 'Return of the King'. The film has a slow start which can lead to some impatience but it builds to a visceral battle at Helm's Deep which is filmed using a combination of CGI and regular stunt work. Viggo Mortenson gets a larger share of the action this time as the heroic Aragorn. Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis is a remarkable Special Effects creation and singlehandedly lifts this film to another level. His pitiable yet frightening conversations with himself are mesmerizing.

		<shortDescription>Part of the Greatest Story Ever Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that 'the Lord of the Rings' is one of the greatest stories ever told. The tale of Frodo Baggins and the ring of power continues in the second part of the trilogy, where Frodo and Sam are continuing their relentless quest to Mordor to destroy the ring, only to be joined by the sinister yet pitiable creature known as Gollum. Meanwhile, Merry &amp; Pip try their hardest to escape from the evil orcs who captured them at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', whilst Gimley, Legolas and Aragorn meet a king and immediately sense something is not right. Old characters return and new ones are introduced as the tale of the Ring grows closer to it's end.The extended edition is far superior to the original, though the amount of time it takes to watch borderlines on ridiculous. there are many (necessary) explanations and more focus on various story arcs. I was especially pleased at the extra focus on Arwen and Aragorn, one of the main stories to hold my interest.As with the 1st of the films, each shot, every scene is spectacular to watch, and as the viewer you never question the integrity of this fantasy world - for a few hours you truly are transported into this world, the characters do exist, the elves, dwarfs, orcs, ents and hobbits are all real. The soundtrack is breathtaking and the acting is superb - the characters all look and sound the part and the script is infallible. I don't really have any complaints, except (as I mentioned earlier) for the length of the film, but as this is the extended edition, and that no matter how long this film is it never once feels boring, all is forgiven on my part and I sincerely look forward to watching 'the Two Towers' again. This is how film adaptations from books are meant to be done. Those responsible for the Harry Potter and Narnia films would do to take heed and learn from the master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, another day, another part of the LotR saga.Those who saw The Two Towers' trailer over and over again, as it was shown a million times everywhere, already learned that the Gollum creature, who appeared very briefly in "Fellowship", would be an important character in this next installment and also knew the big spoiler that Gandalf was returning from the dead. Thanks a lot, trailers, you ruined what would have been a pleasant surprise.So, now, the remnants of the Fellowship part ways, Frodo and Sam in their quest to Mordor and, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on the search of the missing hobbits.The emotional center of this story is no longer the ring or the Fellowship, but two different introductions. On one hand, Gollum, the first CGI character to have big psychological issues, marvelous portrayal by Andy Serkis, and also Rohan, the country that becomes the first victim of Saruman's improved Uruk-Hai and their invasion.For the Rohan side, it's a beautiful portrayal of the vast land and it's inhabitants, mainly King Theoden, and his nephews, Eowyn and Eomer. With this setting, the story turns into more of a war epic than an adventure quest, like in the first movie. The big battle scene is longer than the one in the prologue and it's much more detailed. You get to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in full action, even though this is technically not their battle.However, even though Frodo's story is the most important one, with all the build up and excitement for the battle at Helm's Deep, whenever you see Frodo, Sam and Gollum on their journey, you want to see what happens on the other side, and you don't really care for them.There's a scene in which Galadriel tells a summary of what has happened, and that makes it sort of an intermission, not only for the movie, but for the whole saga. It drags too, but it's good information for those who just walked in.The scenes with Merry, Pippin and the Ents were also killing the thrill for the battle going on, but later on, you see them in full action.The scenes with the Uruk-Hai in the forest at night had me cracking up. "We ain't got nothing but maggoty for three stinking days!".Still, the sequence with the forbidden pool was my least favorite. It didn't say anything and slowed down the plot, at least to me. Not only that, it made the previous scene with Frodo confronting Gollum rather useless. Why show him remembering Smeagol if he eventually goes back to Gollum. Still, it add a little more in the tragedy concerning the once hobbit. In the end, you are left with a small cliffhanger, Gollum wishing to take the ring from Frodo after "she" kills them.The score here presents themes for both narrative cores: Rohan, a beautiful Norse country melody, and Gollum, a sneaky theme for his plotting and a more gentle theme for his Smeagol persona, and also a Björk sounding song (performed by Emiliana Torrini) for the end credits, that inspires awe when you listen. Still, the famed "Shire" and "Fellowship" themes are back with different arrangements, making them always a good listen, and, one of my favorites, Sam's theme, comes back as a reprise in the CD. Also, you can hear the Uruk-Hai pounding theme (which I first mistook as the orc's theme) a little longer.As for the cinematography, special effects, visual effects, set design and costumes, are all flawless. What else can I say? It's funny. When "Towers" ends, nothing left unresolved in "Fellowship" was resolved here. Again, the ring hasn't been destroyed and Merry and Pippin haven't met Aragorn and the rest (although they did meet Gandalf). But, the Rohan situation is resolved, and Saruman with his Uruk-Hai is defeated. Not only that, Gandalf returns and Rohan is saved. That's very relieving, and doesn't make you feel frustrated. That's why it's far more enjoyable from beginning to end. This is a noble successor to "The Fellowship of the Ring", and my second favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Trilogy Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trilogy of the Lord of The Rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... Of course that don't have everything that are in the books like:-Tom Bombadil -Barrow Wights -Erkenbrand -The Grey Company -The Gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -The Lords of Gondor like Elphir, Hirluin... -Dol Amroth and Prince Imrahil and their charge to help the Rohirrim -Battle in the Shire -The Scout of Gondor that send the Red Arrow -Ghan-buri-Ghan and his people -Sam use the ringAnd other things but the movies aren't the book, is not because of that that the movie is better or worse, the movie is an adaptation not the book... My advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions, have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better :) The scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this, the backgrounds are amazing I think it was a great production :)So my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of Tolkien that make possible all this huge success...Now wait for the Hobbit :)In short words:LOTR -&gt; Epic! :)(Sy for my English, Portuguese here)RegardsRodolfo Fernandes Costa</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Two Towers is Peter Jackson's next Lord of The Rings movies to be released and it is a masterpiece. From start to finish you feel yourself immersed in an epic tale of friendship, evil, and hope. The Two Towers gives more time for characterization then the first did. We really get to know Pippin, Merry, Legolas, and Gimli better and more importantly we truly care about these characters. The acting is phenomenal and the special effects are gorgeous. The battle of Helm's deep is the best battle scene of all time. Andy Serkis is wonderful and disturbing as playing the tormented, unstable Gollum. Peter Jackson has truly continued the legacy of the film franchise of The Lord of The Rings series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My pick as the superior episode of this trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, adapted from the famous book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien (which I haven't read), this second installment is my favourite. It should have been the one to sweep the Academy Awards, as the last chapter in the trilogy did. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I get the feeling that the Academy jumped on the juggernaut/band-wagon for the final episode.The main reason I liked this movie so much was for the engrossing war scenes. It's one of the few films where there are countless thousands of soldiers fighting yet is nevertheless fascinating. Notable failures in this respect include one of the early Star Wars prequels (hey, apart from the third installment of that prequel trilogy, they're all pretty forgettable). In that movie, countless thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other was just mind-numbingly boring. As was the giant brawl between hundreds of apes in one of the sequels to the "Planet of the Apes" series.In "Two Towers" you get one things those failures didn't have...military strategy. Tension is built up by seeing military tactics and equipment deployed. It's just not one humongous but mindless fight scene. The best example of that is when one of the castles is besieged and attacked.In any case, this if a fine trilogy. Watch it from start to finish. It's just the second chapter that I'd give 5 stars too, though.</fullReview>

Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, best casting choice ever, Viggo Mortensen, who would have though, everyone else is also great even Christopher Lee who I don't think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it! And of course who can forget Cate Blamchett who is barely on screen but all the same is excellent. Dialogue, excellent, what more can I say, if you haven't seen this movie you have not been born yet!

		<shortDescription>A breathtaking 3-hour long climax of a terrific motion picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Even better than the first. Bigger and definitely better. No matter how excellent, breathtaking or expensive the original adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was, it would seem like a dress rehearsal compared to its follow-up, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS. Recalling the second of the original STAR WARS trilogy THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE TWO TOWERS is but a bridge connecting the original to the finale of Tolkien's "Rings" trilogy, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING which was released the following year. Although not everything is concluded here in TWO TOWERS, it does have its beginning and end (and the flavorful inside at the middle). Think of it as one breathtaking climax of an entire movie, and have yourself a great time.This follow-up continues, but not necessarily concludes, the events portrayed in the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor, while two Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) find allies with the Ents (tree-like giants) in the dark forests. While looking for Merry and Pippin, much of the real story unfolds with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join forces with the Rohan people to fight against an out-numbering army created by the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee) bent to destroy Middle-Earth. The unforgettable battle climax (of a climax) is breathtakingly wonderful, made even more impressive by the fact that it's been made with combinations of miniatures, digital rendering, real people and other technology possibly available.But like the first film, this isn't all just technical advancements and special effects. THE TWO TOWERS doesn't water down Tolkien's story into a big-budget blunder. The film also isn't just made for a limited audience. Whether you know what's what or not about Tolkien's trilogy, this movie will still be enjoyable and entertaining. Once again, director Peter Jackson has made a movie for the audiences, not simply for a limited audience. The big-budget shows throughout the film, but it also shows that it's a great film with its storyline, characters and screen-writing. Few of today's Hollywood minds usually forget it, but Jackson couldn't afford to commit those sidesteps.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quest Continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tolkien 's works had been put into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology,an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21th century. Each scene has heart,a bit of humour,heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood,Orlando Bloom,Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler.In The Two Towers (where we left off), The Fellowship has been broken. But the quest to destroy the One Ring continues as Frodo &amp; Sam make their way to Mordor. But the creature Gollum had been following them. The two hobbits captured him; But the pitiful creature peals, and in return he will show the way through Mordor, and now Frodo &amp; Sam must entrust their lives to him. As Sauron's (and his puppet-slave Saruman's) army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people (and creatures) from Middle Earth, prepares for battle. For the War of The Ring has began. I kind of like how the Princess Eowyn develops a crush for Aragorn...I know she's a princess and her brother Eomer is a prince because the king of Rohan is their uncle. But he has someone else - Arwen, and during the scene when they're heading for Helm's Deep, it kind of shows Aragorn's feelings for Arwen between a dream and a flashback. And you know, I never like Wormtongue anyhow,and how he gawks at our Princess Eowyn...Ewww! he like, likes her.I have a few favorite scenes: Like when Gandalf returns as "Gandalf The White" and with Aragorn,Legolas and Gimli rode off to Rohan. But they were greeted by the guard are were ordered to put down their weapons (except for Gandalf and his staff). On his throne,Theodan was under the control of Saruman (and his slave Grima Wormtongue). But Gandalf drew out Saruman "like poison to a wound;" he did and the spell was broken. And I also like it, when on the road to Helms Deep, Gimli was explaining to Eowyn about his kind (dwarves), but then the horse he was on bolted away and he fell off (that was funny). And, I love how Arwen was convinced by her father Elrond that the age of Elves is ending, and she leaves for the West, truly a heart-tugging father/daughter moment... I have a thing for father/daughter relationships. But Elrond ponders whether the Elves should still help Men. You know, when I first seen it in the theatre,I was sure she (Arwen) was going to leave until...OOPS! That is all I am telling you, you will have to see the third film for yourself how it all ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most annoying complaints people had for the first film was about the ending. Well, if any of them was a little more interested in it then they would have learned that it was, in fact, a trilogy. Well, duh!The film picks up exactly where the film left off, with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli racing off to try and save their hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin from the fearsome Uruk-Hai who have them in their grasp, and are racing back to Isengard with them for their master, the wizard Saruman, who believes that the two hobbits have the One Ring, which he hopes to get for himself. Saruman betrayed everything he once fought for to join Sauron, but even so, he is subtly trying to make Sauron fall. Our other hobbits, Frodo and Sam, are journeying ever closer to Mordor with each new day, where their journey will end only once Frodo has destroyed the One Ring. But, quickly into the film, the pair capture the creature Gollum, whom they take as their guide to get to Mordor. Is Gollum trustworthy? Who knows. In years gone past, he had possession of the One Ring, and that indeed was the reason he was caught: he was trying to reclaim the Ring for himself. Will his evil alter-ego finally take control of his consciousness? Or will he revert to his former self, Smeagol?With so many people searching for the One Ring, the chances aren't good for Frodo ever making it to Mordor. But if he doesn't, and the Ring goes back to it's master, Sauron, then all of Middle-earth is doomed. This is part of the defining trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, and while all films in the trilogy were critically acclaimed, this received the most acclaim. Personally, I think that the director, Peter Jackson, has saved the best till last, with the Return of the King.But, all of the three films are as good as it gets, and this one is certainly no exception. The stunning special effects thanks to WETA workshops render every orc, troll and other beast that appears in this movie utterly believable. The beautiful landscapes that are the backdrop of this film also give it its credibility. Without doubt, if it had been shot in a studio, there would be no comparison between the two. New Zealand will forever now be considered as Middle-Earth. In short?groundbreaking cinematic history. It'll be awhile before something quite like this ever pops up again.</fullReview>

After re-watching Fellowship of The Ring and truly being enchanted by it I anxiously watched The Two Towers and it just didn't quite captivate me the way that Fellowship did. Many trilogies stumble during their second installment because it's almost a necessary drawl between the first and the third...beginning and end and you have to fill in all the important information to join the two. Certainly the climax of The Two Towers is very important and that's the battle of Helm's Deep and that is really what The Two Towers is all about and it just continually builds up to that and it drags while it's getting there. The characters don't give near the same effort to the expanding story and the action is minimal compared to the original. Yes it has the epic Helm's Deep Battle but it's just a different all around feel to it. Much has changed and there is a lot going on but it's almost too much. I mean The Two Towers spans a lot of information from the book (no I have never read them) so it does have big shoes to fill and I respect that but I just didn't get the same epic feel from it.The entire cast returns for the second and adds some new faces as well, including one of the most infamous movie characters of all time. I won't spend too much time on the original cast because I did that for Fellowship but they all do a good job. However it feels like they've lost a little something with this second installment. Part of this may be because some of the characters change so dramatically. Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins goes through an intense change as the ring begins to catch hold of him and almost turns him. Wood's performance is a little more subtle than Fellowship but still very good. Also Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf having fallen through the earth and returned as Gandalf the White. This new version is less emotional and a little more rough around the edges and I miss the old Gandalf and it really took something away from the character for me because McKellen was amazing in the original. The addition of one of the most famous movie characters is that of computer generated Gollum based on the expressions of movements of Andy Serkis, a very talented character actor (also contributed his movements to King Kong.) I personally found Gollum annoying and overused to the likes of Jar Jar Binks and felt more the same way about him that Sam did in the film. Bernard Hill is good as the determined and concerned King Theoden, and Miranda Otto is alright as Eowyn, the niece of the King but I have my issues with her storyline. The addition of Treebeard and the Trees of the forest was also a very cool addition and I love their part in the story.One of the most annoying and frustrating aspects for me in The Two Towers is this strange and completely unnecessary pseudo-romance that is established between Aragorn and Eowyn. They spent so much time making us feel the incredible, life altering love between Aragorn and Arwen in The Fellowship and it only infuriates the movie watcher to see him contemplating love with someone else although he never acts on it. It seems to diminish the power of their romance. For the SMALL minority that do find The Lord Of The Rings films 'boring,' it's almost understandable with The Two Towers. I mean don't get me wrong, it still has it's breath taking moments and the special effects and the direction and cinematography is brilliant but it moves at a much slower pace and takes much longer to fill in all these gaps that are required to get The Fellowship to The Return of The King. So you can't not watch The Two Towers and it is a must see for it's value but it isn't the best in the series by a long shot. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good adventure, but could have been much better than it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was somewhat disappointed in The Two Towers. I felt that the editing was a little choppy resulting in a lack of transition between some scenes. I hope the extended edition of the DVD will correct this.And while I can allow for the introduction of certain scenes not found in the Trilogy to maintain the love interest angle, I can see no need to introduce a story line that simply doesn't exist in Tolkien's work. The principal example is this: in Tolkien, the elves never showed up at Helm's Deep, and the captain of the elves, Haldir, while he did an exceptional job of dying in the movie, did not die in the battle at Helm's Deep. The introduction of that into the movie served no useful purpose that I can see. I could have lived without it, and Peter Jackson should have lived without it.Another example is when Aragorn went off the cliff during the battle with the Wolf Riders. It can be inferred from Tolkien that a fight with the Wolf Riders could have occurred, because the text is clear about the fact that some skirmishes did occur on the way to Helm's Deep. But Tolkien goes out of his way to indicate that the encounters were minor. They were of the "hit-n-run" variety. Still, I can live with the movie presentation. But Aragorn did not go off that cliff; he did not float down stream; and he did not reappear. That part of the movie can only serve as a possible introduction to a second love interest, and a conflict in Aragorn's mind over his future. If that was the intent, it was poorly done.But my major complaint with this movie is the shabby treatment given to Faramir. He was an honorable man in Tolkien. He was able to do what his brother was not able to do. He knew the Ring of Power was within his grasp, but he never saw it. Indeed, he did not want to see it. And he let Frodo go. He did not drag him off to present him as a gift, and Frodo never stood on that wall and faced the Ringwraith. Putting this into the movie was an unjustified modification of Tolkien's work. It served no purpose other than to add perhaps 5 minutes to the running time of the flick. That is a poor excuse for doing such a hatchet job on a man's work. Unforgivable!All of this leaves me with some doubt about how Jackson will handle Part III of the Trilogy. Does he have the nerve to do it right and do it completely? We shall see.Mr. Jackson, you have an unprecedented opportunity here. Please don't waste it. This could be YOUR magnum opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor character development &amp; emotionless dialogue create disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers)I love the book and Fellowship of the ring was fairly good. There was one thing wrong with it and that was there was no emotion to the movie. As if they were following a script and said ho hum. When Gandalf fell, there was no emotion. When another dude died after that I felt nothing.They failed to correct this in The Two Towers. And whats worse is that it's all battle scenes. Only a few characters in this movie. No character development. In every Star Wars movie, there's been character development. So for some reason Peter Jackson decided that all the character development was done in the Fellowship. It doesn't work that way.Another problem. Special Effects. What special effects? The trees look like they came out of the Neverending Story. And that was almost 20 years ago.Yeah of course the battle scenes are probably totally computer animated, I'm not griping about those. I just think this movie fails to deliever. I certainly hope Return of the King is much better than this.My recommendation, go read the book. (preferably the all in one LOTR book.)6/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a disappointment for me, I am a huge Tolkien fan and I loved the Fellowship movie, but Two Towers has some big flaws that prevented it from being as good as the first in the trilogy...1. Very americanized, they put alot of cheesy hollywood gimmicks into it, they also obviously added more of Viggo and Orlando, because of the sucess of the previous film. I found these thing disturbing, and it shamed Tolkien's perfect tale.2. Bad editing/pacing. They felt they had to juggle all of the characters more and more throughout the movie, it is very distracting because in the book, Tolkien perfectly went from one group to the next, right when you're getting really excited, so it kept the interest of the reader high. This was not done in the movie however.3. MORE changes in the story. The film's biggest flaw, they changed more of the story, added some lousy scenes into the movie that weren't in the book, and had some bad add-ons also. This disappointed me because they were pretty good about keeping the movie close to the book in the first movie, what I felt this movie was is a gift to the stupid audiences to make more money.I just wanted to stress these major flaws because all the reviews I have seen say this movie was great, even better than the Fellowship.But there are a couple good features in this film, like Gollum is spectacular, I have to take my hat off for the special effects people, because that character was extremely well done.And I was impresses with Elijah Wood's acting in this movie, he was outshined in the first one, but he really showed his talent in a couple scenes in this one.Overall, I would say this movie was 7.5/10, but perhaps people would like it if they haven't read the books, and had nothing to compare it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Fantasy Film of All Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is the best fantasy film series ever made. This is surprising for people who are familiar with Jackson's earliest work ("Bad Taste", for example). But give the man a decent budget and he can command a film. Of the three films, this is possibly the strongest (though the third is also good). Generally, fight scenes tend to bore me, but here Jackson makes them interesting, fun to watch and "epic" in the best sense of the word.Although coming in at three hours, the extended edition adds on another forty minutes. I have not seen this, but from what I hear it is a must-see. And I cannot disagree. The three hours is all killer, no filler... if the remaining scenes are just as good, there is no reason to miss out on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a step up from Fellowship,The Two Towers won't leave you time to catch your breath,it's exhilarating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers does something incredibly rare these days,that's outdo the 1st in every way possible. While Fellowship Of The Ring is technically good,and very well made,it wasn't very fun to watch at all. The Two Towers manages to grip you for the whole 170 minutes or so and that's quite a feat to pull off,because often for me that's way too overlong. The Battle sequences are quite a sight to be hold,it honestly never stops,it's just so action packed you won't have time to catch your breath. Everyone seemed so much more comfortable this time around,they all seemed to know there roles this time around,unlike the last time where everyone seemed all tense. I've never read the novels so I can't compare them to the films,but what I liked most about this film was the growing tension of Gollum's obsession with The Ring. He is frighteningly unpredictable and managed to make my skin crawl. I hadn't felt that much growing tension in a long,long time with Gollum and Frodo it was really harrowing stuff. While not quite the extent to "Return Of The King" you start to see the pressure Frodo has of being The Ring holder.You slowly start to see him have a growing obsession for it,it just created a great storyline if you ask me. I also must mention how frightening Christopher Lee was as Saruman. he really gave me the creeps often and was the perfect foe. The Two Towers is everything Fellowship is not,it's exciting,tension filled and downright gripping.Performances. Elijah Wood is perfect this time around. He is often a complete revelation. We feel for him,we feel his pressure,we also see how strong his friendship with Sam truly is. Sean Astin continues to grow as an actor. He is even better as Sam this time around,he has more to play with,his charisma with Elijah is even better this time around,if that's even possible. Ian McKellen is pure class all the way. He put on an intense show,Ian can do no wrong in my mind. Viggo Mortensen as i've mentioned before in my reviews is not a favorite of mine,but he is much better this time around as Aragorn. He is strong,charismatic and only had a few wooden moments,good job!. Billy Boyd&amp;Dominic Monaghan provide decent comic relief and make a likable tandem. Christopher Lee plays one of the most frightening villains in years as Saruman. His banter with McKellen is a treat to watch. Miranda Otto is pretty cute and was quite likable as Eowyn. Bernard Hill carries quite a strong presence with him. I enjoyed his character as Theoden. Brad Dourif is always great as slimy characters,so it's only fitting he played Grima. Orlando Bloom is once again too cool for School. I normally despise Elves,but he is simply a bad ass. Cate Blanchett is OK,like the 1st. John Rhys-Davies is less annoying then in Fellowship,but really that's not saying much. Liv Tyler is quite wooden this time around,I often felt her scenes were worthless. Hugo Weaving is also wooden,unlike the 1st where he was a required presence. Rest of the cast do there jobs fine.Bottom Line. Two Towers is excitement like no other. I am usually not a fan of this type of genre,but Two Towers is so exciting,I will make an exception in this case. You won't find excitement like this in a lot of place,so it's only right I give Two Towers my highest recommendation,I can possibly give.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's version would have been... unbearable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in the new Star Wars trilogy, I have to say: thank God no high-profile a****** actors were hired to ruin this for me. The newcomers to the trilogy vary from good to terrific; importantly, Miranda Otto is attractive if a bit flat-chested (but, okay, this isn't an erotic thriller), and Karl Urban is the stand-out in TT. This time Wood has more interesting scenes as Frodo, and as a result he gets to show more. McKellen doesn't appear much, but when he does he dominates, like in "FOTR". Mortenssen also shows a slight improvement. Only Tyler, our three-meter MTV airhead adds nothing to the movie. In the "TT" book she doesn't even appear at all, but Jackson wanted to make that extra $100 million dollars from the female movie-goers so he had some pointless romantic scenes thrown in which probably have Tolkien - if not spinning - than at least shaking his head in his grave. In fact, the non-book, added "Hollywood scenes" are in contrast to the rest of the movie: the dialog is weaker, the tension isn't there, etc. But these 5-10 minutes objectively constitute the sole drawback in an otherwise near-perfect movie. And to be fair - they aren't exactly dull or bad.Let's not forget that had Spielberg done the trilogy there would have been incomparably more tampering with the original text, and the sentimentality and pathos would be oozing out of every pore of the movie. Spielberg the Movie Mo-Ghoul played with the idea of filming the trilogy and it gives me great satisfaction to know that he was none too happy when Jackson showed interest in it and started making the first preparations. Not to mention that Jackson actually got off his a** and actually DID this monumental saga. Spielberg was seething with jealousy. I could sense it across the ocean. There is something in the transatlantic breeze that smells of Spielberg's fuming.In fact, this is how the trilogy would have been had Spielberg the Uncrowned God of Hollywood done it: 1) cast: Tom Hanks as Aragorn * Tom Cruise as Borimir * Macauley Culkin as Frodo * Culkin's fat brother (Keeran?) as Samwise * Laura Dern (with black hair) as Arwen * Denzel Washington as Gandalf (a nice PC touch, having a black man be the wisest of them all) * Paul Newman as Saruman * Kiefer Sutherland as Wormtongue * two Asian kids as Mary and Pippen (probably two of Spielberg's own adopted brood) * Danny de Vito as Gimli (without the make-up, and even more wise-cracking) * Di Crapio as an ultra feminine-looking Legolas * Laura Dern (playing two roles) as a Galadria one would want to vomit on * Christian Slater as a Faramir who can't say his "s" properly * Warren Beatty, looking as dumb as ever, as Theoden * John Travolta as a highly animated Lord Denethor * Drew Barrymore as Eowyn * Ashton Kutcher as Eomer. Gollum would probably be animated so as to be cute, cuddly and with big, wide Pocahontas eyes, plus a girl's voice (probably Winona Ryder's) and all evil would have been scripted out of him. Treebeard would look very little like a true; it would be Robin Williams with two vaguely treeish legs dangling at the bottom. He wouldn't talk slow, like all Ents, but quickly with plenty of one-liners.There would be none of that wonderful dark-blue/green look; even Saruman's tower would be pink/red and with flowers surrounding it instead of trees. The Ents wouldn't have deep voices but would sound like a bunch of old women (like Python's pepper-pots); the ecological message would have been so exaggerated that the Ents would be shown in a brief sequence holding anti-Exxon, anti-globalism, anti-pollution banners in front of Saruman's Isengard. (Saruman would then come out on the terrace and tell the Ents that he refuses to sign the Kyoto Treaty.) Galadria would have a half-hobbit half-sister sidekick, played by Cameron Diaz, and Frodo would fall in love with her and suffer deeply when she gets captured by Orcs (in Peter Greenaway's version the Orcs would torture her, rape her, then kill her and eat her, while reciting Japanese poetry). Tom Bombadil would have been not only included in the movie but turned into a main character, singing Elton John and Phil Collins soundtrack songs while spreading thinly disguised pacifism and left-wing ideology; needless to say, he'd be played by Collins or John. One of the main characters would be homosexual. How about Boromir? No, Boromir is a bit susceptible to evil and as we all know all homosexuals are nice people and not at all the type to try to steal the Ring of Power from Frodo. Aragorn? No, for he loves Arwen and we can't have him kissing Faramir because the gay community would be offended by a "bisexual" gay. Bilbo, perhaps, as the childless uncle of Frodo? Right. Bilbo would have an elvish boyfriend in Edoras, which would hit two flies with one stroke: this would act both as support for gays and for interracial relationships. In fact, it would even be hinted that Bilbo had a brief romance with Elrond (in his "Hobbit" period) and that Arwen even encourages her father to renew his old affair with Bilbo, now that Bilbo's come back. (There would be a touching scene in which Arwen comforts her sobbing father to forgive Bilbo for breaking his heart 50 years earlier.) But for Spielberg, two love affairs wouldn't be enough; the hobbits must also have their love-interests. Merry would fall in love with a female Orc (signifying that no species/race is so evil that it is beyond redemption), named Orcana, who would aid the Fellowship in their adventures. Orcana's female cousin - Urukhaia - would fall in love with Pippen, etc.</fullReview>

There are so many characters to follow that unless you've read the book, it just gets too confusing.The battle scene at the end was spectacular but it just drug on and on and I never understood why gandalf didn't just use his wizardry to win the battle for aragon.And then we come to the stupid kids. Thankfully the kids didn't try to play cute and make the viewer retch but they're still kids and simply don't make believable heroes.I've now seen the first two LOTR films and i thought both were pretty poor but i rate them as 5s because of the great special FX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This series seems competently made, but it lacks the drive that Tolkien displayed. Even if I look past the fact that a lot of the visuals seem to be based on the works of doodler Allan Lee, I cannot get past the vision of good and bad, which seems to be the same as in any other Hollywood movie, and so far removed from the conservative, cold-romantic view of the original author. There's history. There's written history. Then there were a bunch of irreverent hobbits, who figured they could write the history from a hobbit's eye perspective. That (red) book got translated by an English professor.I remember the doubts from Tolkien fans when they heard Peter Jackson was going to film LotR. At first, I shared those doubts, but then I realised that he was only following tradition. Of course, he would be making a romanticized, Hollywoodized version of the story. He would be making a fiction based on a true story, and he would be doing that true story injustice in the process. Taking that as a given, would the end result still be an enjoyable movie, all by itself? And I think that largely it is; but I don't see it as more than a competent re-telling of the subject matter. I liked Tolkien's more factual translation better. The LotR trilogy is hastily told, at times it feels like I am looking at abstracts of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film, but barely Tolkien!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen FOTR and loved it - the acting, the scenery, the sets, and the fact that the film captured the spirit of Tolkien, I was desperate to see TTT. I knew that it was going to be changed from the book more than FOTR had been, but didn't know that it was going to be changed to the extent that it was.1. The nauseating 'Arwen' inclusion is a disaster. It has nothing to do with Tolkien, however romantic and 'beautiful' they tried to make the scenes, and despite the fact that they had Hugo Weaving's seductive voice in one of them (in point of fact that was the only scene with 'Arwen' that bore a remote resemblance to Tolkien, i.e. the appendix). Putting this virtually new character into the film has meant that various changes were made which took away from much needed time that could have been used to explore the real Tolkien story. For instance, why have the Warg fight - just so that Aragorn could fall over a cliff and have 'Arwen' change into a horse over him? It was totally unnecessary to change Tolkien's storyline - the original story is brilliant enough in itself.And why does 'Arwen' appear everywhere in the promotional stuff - is she being used to promote the film? The main characters in the story are FAR more important, and they are who most people feel is important to the story, and want to see.2. Why did Eomer disappear for virtually the whole film? Why was Treebeard - supposedly the oldest and wisest being in Middle-earth - portrayed as stupid? Where was the noble Faramir? Why wasn't there more of Gandalf, who is the figure around which everything turns? Where were the wonderful Huorns, and all the action involving them, which we were so much looking forward to? Why was there so little about the Hobbits, who with Gandalf are the main characters in Tolkien's LOTR? None of this is the fault of the actors, because the casting for the film is excellent - it is great that they used mostly British, New Zealand and Australian actors who weren't known 'movie stars', which would have completely ruined the film. It is to do with the way the story was rewritten.Certainly there are brilliant things in the film - Gollum, Gandalf leading the charge on Shadowfax at the end of the film, the three running at the beginning of the film, the horses, Edoras, Helm's Deep, the marching Uruk Hai, New Zealand as Middle Earth, the costumes, among other things . . . but it would have been so much better if the story had been stuck to. The changes just seem so pointless, and I've heard far more criticism than praise for them.I really, really hope ROTK will go back to the books, but think this may be a forlorn hope - for one thing, I don't know how they could squash everything in from TTT that wasn't included in the film, and still do ROTK justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The earlier film was a disgrace; this one is even more of a disgrace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hears a lot about the overwhelming majority of people who think otherwise (as if overwhelming majorities cannot be wrong), but I don't believe that this majority exists. Many of the people I talk to know full well how bad Jackson's films are, and most of the rest are ambivalent; moreover, as I watch the people walking out of "The Two Towers", few are genuinely excited. Most of them look as though they've been bludgeoned into submission by crude overkill and sheer boredom. I'm sure many of these poor souls come to THINK they liked the film, but I think they're wrong even on this point.Before I launch into my attack (the film itself did nothing but attack ME for three hours; now it's my turn to attack IT), I'm obliged to point out that it does improve on "The Fellowship of the Ring" in some respects. It looks better. Rohan really looks like Rohan, or if not like Rohan, at least like some place in particular (in the original, Jackson mixed unrelated and mostly unattractive locations with wild abandon), the CGI is marginally less offensive, and there is one (1) effective use of imagery: the bit in which Frodo's elven cloak makes him look like a rock. This is not to say that the film is on balance a visual success. The camera still swoops around too much (reminding one of a British Airways ad, and composer Howard Shore has obligingly written music to complete the effect), and the endless hordes of Nintendo creatures in the interminable battle scenes fail to look one tenth as thrilling as a real shot of a handful of real people standing on a real hill (when the camera stays still enough to let us get a good look at either, which isn't often).But let's look at some of the changes Jackson has made to the story and the characters. I'd like to make it clear: I don't object to changes per se. The day I say "The Two Towers" I also saw "Treasure Planet", which (disappointment though it was) was a far more intelligent adaptation of an original work ? it moved the entire sequence of events centuries ahead and into outer space, yes, but it neither made complete nonsense of nor wilfully misunderstood its own story. It's the NATURE of Jackson's changes, not the mere fact that changes were made, that show us just how inept a film-maker he really is. Consider (spoilers ahead)?(1) Faramir in the book finds out about the ring in a private conference between himself, Frodo, and Sam, and has the wisdom to let it be then and there; Faramir in the film decides to pounce on the ring immediately as extras run around behind, in front of and between the various parties, and he even binds the hobbits and drags them to Gondorso that we are forced to sit through YET ANOTHER tedious "action" sequence before he changes his mind. One wonders: what's the point in even hiring two actors to play Boromir and Faramir, rather than one, if their characters are identical? And why not have Tolkein's quiet moment of truth in private, when we've already sat through more than enough sword-clashing? Not content by this blunder, Jackson compounds it, by letting us know that not just Faramir, not just the underlings he carelessly discusses state secrets in front of, but everyone of any consequence in Gondor, knows all about the ring. We're told that Faramir is LEGALLY BOUND to seize that ring, and that his life will be forfeit if he does not. "Then it's forfeit," he says, thrusting out his chest and waiting for the curtain to fall. No doubt these words sound very fine to thirteen-year-old Dungeons and Dragons players, but if Boromir was merely obeying the law on pain of death when he tried to take the ring, doesn't this make COMPLETE NONSENSE of all the earlier characterisation, such as it was (and destroy any sense we may have of the way in which the Ring corrupts genuine goodness)? Indeed it does.(2) The Ents, we are told, are "not hasty" (and the film is concerned to make sure that this trait is played for cheap laughs). They deliberate at great length before deciding to remain neutral. Then ? at the sight of destruction they knew about anyway ? it takes them FIVE SECONDS to change their mind and go to war. (Five seconds is the time it takes all of them, collectively, to mount an invasion. Individual minds switch track more quickly still.) Does Jackson have the SLIGHTEST CLUE what he is doing?I could multiply examples easily: the contrived suspense of Aragorn's "death", the intrusion of elves into those parts of the story where their intrusion makes no sense, the fact that the elves look like the kind of stormtroopers that vampires would have used if vampires had invented fascism, the bickering between Frodo and Sam and between Theoden and everyone. But it's not just the idiocy of these changes individually that worries me, but their effect collectively. Jackson says that his version of "The Two Towers" is "darker" than Tolkein's; for "darker", read bloodthirstier, more cynical, more redolent of right-wing nastiness, less variegated. HIS world is one in which people squabble constantly, in which nobody has an unprompted noble thought or impulse, in which the forces of good have little left worth saving and in which power has little left worth the trouble of corrupting. It's the small-minded and mean-spirited work of a director who (as we know from a thousand flat-footed errors) is unable to handle a large canvas ? whose mind is unable to encompass a large world containing more than one kind of thing.It's a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps a second viewing will change my mind. But as of now, I was generally disappointed in "The Two Towers".Not much in the way of character development, too much cross-cutting between scenes which oftentimes left me reeling. The FX were generally brilliant, though Merry and Pippin riding on Treebeard offered some pretty obvious green-screen backgrounds.I suppose I was left cold the most by the end of the battle at Helms Deep. It just sort of ended...with no real explanation on how it ended...or why, etc.The "snowboarding" of Legolas down the stairs was a real laugher, and not in a good sense.I'm mainly p***ed that Andy Serkis as Gollum didn't get any sort of acknowledgement from the Oscar folk. He was absolutley brilliant. Was he left out because he was covered in CGI? Obviously. But is covering him in pixels any different than covering an actor in prosthetics/makeup? John Hurt was nominated for "The Elephant Man" in 1980...and no, he didn't win. But he was just as unrecognisable as Andy Serkis is in "TTT".As an aside, a brother-in-law and I saw it in it's second week of release. Both of us were left somewhat cold. He gave it an 8 out of 10, and I gave it a 7 out of 10. I gave it a 7 mainly for the sheer scope of the project, the cinematography, the costumes, the FX; all technical achievements. The only acting nod I can really give is again to Andy Serkis.He saw it again just yesterday, and said it was way way (8 times he said "way") better the second time. And he has read the books until the pages fell out and bought them again. Perhaps I will feel the same when I use my free pass to see the movie again.And there will be an extended version of all the "Rings" movies on DVD. I'm hopeful that "TTT" extended version will make it a more enjoyable filmThe extended version of "Fellowship" was far and above a better film than the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!!!! That the makers of this movie can claim that it is based on Tolkien is amazing to me. I'm not an official "purist", but I have read the books, and I know that the books are far better in every aspect. But I won't even compare it to the books... even compared to the average movies coming out of Hollywood, this film is money-making trash.In its defense I would say that the movie has excellent computer animations. I was very satisfied with the way the Ents looked and moved (and stomped on orcs!), and also was impressed with the oliphants. In particular I liked the image of Gandalf and the Balrog falling towards the Underworld ocean. (even if it is not from the book)Otherwise, the movie is a mess. Peter Jackson obviously could not handle the diverging plot lines. (for example, Merry and Pippin are stuck on Treebeard's shoulder while about a week of movie time goes by - quite a long hike through the forest!) The transitions between plots are interrupting, and jumble the flow of the story. I can't imagine trying to make sense of what everyone was doing if I had not previously read the books.The characters in the movie are completely boring, even the new ones. Now that the heroes have been introduced, it appears that the director has lost any energy to develop them further. Gimli becomes the comic stump (and if I really want a dose of midget humor, I'll go to a frat party or watch Jackass). Arwen's weepy narcissism goes out of control. Way too much time is given to her and the other Elvish leaders to act as if they are speaking profoundly and weep prettily in screen closeups. Legolas is now the stunt man, with very little character left to express. Faramir is weak (should have followed the book, Mr. Jackson). Eowynn will hopefully get more attention in the last movie, but she was well-done in the movie, as were Wormtongue and Eomer. Gollum is also fairly amusing, even if he must be turned into a schizo-comic Hamlet.The fact that the movie ended on a somewhat upbeat note (victory of Helm's Deep) instead of the darker, almost hopeless note of the book (Frodo taken captive by orcs after Shelob), is a critical flaw. Precisely what makes one so eager to read on in Tolkien is the situation of near despair, which makes the reversals of fortune, or eucatastrophe, so welcome. Maybe it's true that the middle book is the hardest one to pull off, but that's no excuse for making a poor movie. I had hoped that Peter Jackson could rise to the occasion. Instead he has made a mush of weak emotions, contrived nobility, and lots of slimy orcs.I don't see how a fan of Tolkien can watch the movie and not feel at least a bit cheated, and a bit insulted. This movie is neither beautiful nor interesting, in the artistic sense; it is flashy sensory entertainment produced for universal ease of consumption. If you like the Tolkien-flavored yogurt, well then, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favourite of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What book did they read?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read every book written by Tolkien concerning the Ring and all its adventures. I made it a point to read the book before seeing the movie and after the first movie was quite expectant about what the Two Towers would entail. My rapture lasted less then 30 minutes and by the time one hour was through I thought I read the wrong book. Everything that happens in the movie loosly resembles what goes on in the book. Lines are said by the wrong people and at the wrong time. Events occur out of order and utterly wrong from the book. If the tickets hadn't cost as much as they did I would have walked out. No lover of the Lord of the Rings should waste their money to see this movie. It was an utter disappointment and I can see Tolkien not just rolling but doing an entire gymnastic routine in his grave. What was Peter Jackson thinking as he shot these scenes which were unlike the book as the night is different from the day? He said that he held the books in respect and he treated this one as garbage. I could have compiled it better by shreading the book and having an ape paste it back together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly better than the first film - Jackson's Empire Strikes Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up. Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin. However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden. Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard. Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.The plot sounds plain confusing. And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it. But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well. He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better. On top of this the film's pace is much more even.In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy. Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax. It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first. Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well. All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work. Also the comedy was inserted nicely. Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters. The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur. The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character. However the animation is superb. Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast. He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous. After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others. In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo. I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped. The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick. Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly. Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!? Generally the acting is very good. In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with. Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film. Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch. Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around. Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two bits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I pretty much said all the positives I had to say in my ROTK review. So now I'm going to vent my spleen.I like the fantasy genre for what it is, but these days when I see the overblown and overwrought tweaks to what is supposed to be a mythological genre--I don't know--it just really boggles the mind as to how things could get so out of hand.The fantasy genre is supposed to be taken from historical folklore of a thousand years past. But when one looks at the various iterations of "elves", "paladins", "wizards" and other personae that are said to populate these imaginary worlds, one wonders what went wrong. Final Fantasy has their short spikey-haired over-sized-sword dude, Warhammer has their "Fae in Space" thing going on, and, well, how does anyone buy into this crap in the first place?So what does this have to do with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series? Not much, other than the fact that Tolkien's work was built upon other works, and today's marketers have built upon Tolkien's work, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth. Until we now have huge swords, armor and weapons that could never be made, worn, and much less used. "The Two Towers" somewhat smacks of this, but much of that is Pete Jackson's artistic license.And we need artistic license. It's what makes for good drama. But do trolls have to be twenty-five feet tall, AND wear armor? This film, like the previous film and the subsequent one, to me, suffer from a severe case of taking itself too seriously. Lots of slow motion shots, twirling camera stuff, and a sense of impending doom. Then again the Two Towers was meant to be the angst-ridden middle second act of the series.Truth is I like this film for what it is. I don't have too many gripes with it. But I do take issue with Tolkien fans who really take these films as religious dogma of sorts. I've read pretty much all of Tolkien's works regarding Middle Earth, and his lesser known publications as well. They're entertaining, but I think one would be hard pressed to find any redemption in terms of spiritual enlightenment within the text of Tolkien's thoughts.So, what are my real gripes? The whole current "fantasy" genre as a whole. Not just Pete Jackson's corner of it, but the whole "chainsaw swords" and magical powers with absolutely no basis in anything, deities that are physical manifestations and such... one wonders how anyone in their right mind could be a fan of this junk.The Two Towers has the benefit of being A) popular, and B) well rendered by Pete Jackson's hand. Even so the film seems a bit heavy. Darkly lit, dark mood music with few light moments, impending thesping/circumstances. Do these "folk" (hobbits, elves, dwarfs, men, widgets, and whatever else) ever crack a smile or joke? We got a few moments of levity from the first film, but the second one, this film, seemed rather weighted with its own drama.So what's the point of all this rambling? In the days when legends about elven folk and dwarfs were first conceived and told, they were considered real entities for parables of what and how to avoid the dangers of venturing off from the village by oneself. They were meant to explain away the unexplainable. Now they're a commercial product meant to be exploited by sociopathic marketers. The Two Towers teeter in that direction, but are saved by the creative teams vision for the films.Even so, I think these films were made probably a few years before they should've been made, and I speak of none other than the CGI, which, to my eyes, looks like CGI.So, in the final analysis, what do I have to say about Jackson's version of Tolkien's Two towers? Truth is I'm not too sure. It's an okay film. It entertains. And, really, what more can you ask for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has done it again. He has succeeded in making the Two Towers another perfect installment after his flawless remake of the Fellowship of the Ring. It has (again) flawless acting, good characters, great scenery, good music and it is (again) unpredictable. I wish IMDb would let us vote higher than ten on these movies, I would give this movie (and all of the trilogy) infinity stars, it is so good. Fantasy is always good in my opinion (hence my username) but this surpasses good, great, excellent. This film is flawless, just like the Fellowship of the Ring and the Return of the King. Even though these movies are 12 hours total, (with the extended editions) it feels like an hour. All the cast and crew get an A++++++++++ x infinity x two. Like the Fellowship of the Ring, I give this film a 10/10 and I strongly recommend it to anyone over the age of nine. (what with the violent moments)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of this trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I'm not a fan of fantasy films, and while this series is an exception, I cannot understand why people love to sit down and watch all three of these films at once. I find each film in this series too long and drawn out. Despite that, however, all three of these films are superbly done, and "The Two Towers" proves to be the best "Lord of the Rings" film, in my opinion. From the opening scene, showing the details of Gandalf falling during the middle of the first film, this is a masterpiece. Everything else, from Gollum's "My precious" to the talking and walking trees in the forest is very entertaining. The epic battle scenes toward the end, though overly lengthy, are well done, with tons of little bits of excitement and humor. This movie is filled with great film-making and story-telling from beginning to end, and it also features bits of spiritual allegories, likely inserted into the writing by author J.R.R. Tolkein. A great film, however way too long, as all the films in this trilogy are. I simply can't watch this over and over as some people can without getting bored at many of the long parts. Fantasy lovers, however, and most movie lovers will love this film and everything about it.*** out of ****</fullReview>

His character is one of the most endearing in the trilogy, hats of to the CGI and the great work of Andy Serkis.Moreover, The Battle of Helm's Deep was truly spectacular. The mood, the settings, the calm, the tension, and the music was all top notch. I don't see how we can ever see a better battle on screen!

In my down-to-earth honest opinion, this movie bites so hard that after seeing it, I had to rush to the pharmacy to get some bandages.I didn't bother to see "Fellowship of the Ring" to begin with.* Then I was dragged into seeing this turkey. This movie was immensely hard to follow. Believe me, I tried, but since I never saw the first one, I was completely lost and praying for it to end since the first twenty minutes, but ended up having to sit through it for a mind-numbing three hours. Why does God hate me?Now I am completely and utterly outraged at the fact that this disgrace to film-making is now the seventh top-grossing movie OF ALL TIME. I strongly believe the position could be put to much more intellectual and worthwhile films like "A Beautiful Mind" or even "The Mask", two movies on my all-time favorite list.If you like this movie, I'm glad you have your opinion. But as do I, and don't you dare tell me how great this movie was, because I am completely fed up with this brain-dead garbage.*In case you're wondering why I didn't see the first one, I thought the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy was going to be a series of wannabe-fantasy-action films, but now I know they're just a series of wannabe films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that 'The Two Towers' was definitely worth the Oscar for visual effects. The Golum character is a marvel of the arts and technology. All the visual effects in this movie are better than the first one (where you could even see the wires in the Gandalf-Saruman battle).Now, I believe that they should make only one LOTR, not a trilogy. Take for instance the complete 'Two Towers'. It could be easily omitted in its entirety, as it doesn't really advance the story any further and frankly I believe that the only thing it offers is the great Golum graphics.Just because there are three books, doesn't mean that there must be three movies. Everyone's treating 'Lord of the Rings' like something sacred, which is not.It's like Oscar Wilde said- "Anyone can write a three volume novel. All it takes is complete ignorance of both life and literature."3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an immense Tolkien fan, but rather enjoyed Mr. Jackson's last installment of the trilogy despite of this, and so was looking forward tremendously to this movie. I knew that I would come out of the theater upset, but didn't foresee how just how upset I would be! It's not just that they didn't stick close to the book. Making art from someone else's art is a tricky feat, and I completely understand that to make it a true work of art, the director has to make the piece his, and making the piece his includes injecting his own experiences and interpretations to the piece.It's just that Mr. Jackson had some pretty whacked out interpretations!For example, Faramir. In the books, Faramir is supposed to be Boromir's redemption - here he is just a jerk. This really ticked me off. And WHAT was up with taking Frodo to Gondor? (Don't even get me started on Arwen!)And, as someone has already said, the switches between scenes were sort of distracting. They lent to a heavily sort of "soap opera" feel rather than the epic feel that the books had - and when it comes down to it, that's the major problem of this movie. It just didn't have the right feel. I would have enjoyed it enough as a simple fantasy movie if I hadn't already have read the books and reveled in the brilliance of them. I mean, like I said, it's not that Mr. Jackson made changes. But I just didn't get the feeling that Mr. Jackson understood in the slightest sense what the actual point of the books IS. He messed around with the ESSENCE of the story, and that was what really annoyed me.That Mr. Jackson just doesn't GET the books is evident in two different ways. One is the subtle shifting of the focus of the books from the melancholy of a dying way of life - the Elves having to leave Middle Earth, the passing of the age - to a sort of celebration of the forging of the way of man. The second, and most grieving, is that I can't see, as evidenced from this movie, that he really GETS the core of the good/evil conflict.I'm not doing a very good job of expressing myself. Simply put, I guess I'm saying that I thought that the movie could have done with a little more focus on Frodo and his inner battle than on Aragorn and his love troubles. :)That said, I thought that the scenery was GORGEOUS and there were several moments that I did enjoy - for some strange reason, the moments I found myself liking most were those in which Aragorn and Legolas would start speaking Elvish to each other. I'm not exactly sure why, but I thought that was extremely cool. Gollum was at the same time freaky and cool and one of the things that I thought the movie did an excellent job in portraying.When I left the theater, I was convinced that I never wanted to even hear the third movie mentioned, much less ever darken the door of a theater to see it play. I'm not sure how I feel now - I'll probably still go, but I'll just go to see a fantasy movie that has some relation to the Lord of the Rings. I won't go to see Tolkien, because this movie proved that that was an idealistic expectation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Two Towers? But that wasn't in the book I read...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Two Towers.after seeing the Fellowship of the Ring, I was very excited about the release of this chapter of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Though FOTR wasn't totally true to the writings of Tolkien, the changes director Peter Jackson made to the story were minor, and seemingly necessary to translate this great work of literature into the theatrical medium of film. All in all, FOTR was pretty darn close to the book and helped bring my childhood imaginings of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to life. Having read all of the books a number of times since I was little, you can imagine how I was looking forward to seeing The Two Towers in the same visual format as FOTR, as the book was full of action and exciting new monsters like the giant spider Shelob waiting for Frodo and Sam in the caverns of Mordor. But what a HUGE disappoint it turned out to be!At the beginning of the movie, we are treated to about 10 minutes of footage that we've already seen in FOTR, of course intermixed with some other footage of Gandalf and the Balrog, all but confusing the viewer. This opening footage was completely unnecessary for the viewer to follow the story, and just eats up valuable story telling screen time. I'll get to why this is important later.After this, things seem to recover.Jackson follows the story line of the book for the most part, and then towards the middle of the movie, things go bad. Jackson begins taking liberties with the storyline.a story line written by a great author whose works are what made the fantasy of the LOTR popular. Are these changes necessary for the translation from book to film? Absolutely not. For example, the Ents are only persuaded to go and stop Saruman after Treebeard sees the destroyed forest surrounding Isengard.basically since Saruman is destroying trees, now it's the Ents problem when it wasn't before. The book of course shows the Ents deciding to attack Saruman because of the deeds he's already committed, his affiliation with the hated orcs, and the fact that they know if he wins, the Ents and trees will be doomed as well. The book shows the Ents being wise creatures, acting when necessary. The movie shows them as being uncaring separatists, who have to be persuaded by a couple of idiotic hobbits (which by the way have a REALLY lame persuading speech to the Ents, also not in the book). We also have a scene with the Orcs riding on Worgs, attacking the Riders of the Mark and our remaining members of the fellowship. This whole scene isn't in the book at all, and though is a great action scene, and the Worgs are beautifully done, this whole scene wastes about 15 to 20 minutes of screen time. I'm unclear as to why this change was made; the original story line from the book accomplishes the same tasks, but with less time.Next of course we have the Elves of Rivendale showing up at Helm's Deep. WHAT?!?! This change was made obviously to show some sort of good neighbor attitude from the Elves, but that wasn't of their nature. They were leaving, and made it clear that this fight was that of man. A totally unnecessary change. This fight scene is also full of slow motion camera tricks that are suppose to make the fight more dramatic and intense, but only stetch out an already long fight scene and actually take away from the intensity. For example, one of the Elf captains (who we see from the FOTR) ends up getting killed by an orc, and this scene is slowed down that it ends up taking almost 5 minutes to happen.and this is for a minor character who wasn't even in this scene in the book!!And towards the end of the movie, the change that actually made me angry, was when Boromir's brother (Faramir) is charmed by the ring and takes Frodo, Sam, and Golum back to Gondor, and this point, the rest of the movie is basically NOTHING like the book. First of all, the book has Faramir turn down the chance to take the ring from Frodo while they are in Mordor. This shows the strength of character in Faramir, which was lacking in his brother. This action leads to events in the next book, the Return of the King. Also, with Faramir letting Frodo go free inside Mordor, this allows Frodo to continue his trek to Mount Doom and of course encounter Shelob and the fun twist of thinking Frodo has died by Shelob's bite. But of course, we are denied this, and instead get some lame battle against the Orcs at Gondor and the appearance of a Nazgul who Frodo basically gives himself up to. This whole scene goes against the strength and integrity contained in Frodo that allows him to get all the way to Mount Doom with the Ring in the books. If he wants to give himself up at the mere sight of a Nazgul, how is he going to make it past Sauron into Mount Doom? Of course a the end of this movie, Golum alludes to the fact that he's taking them to Shelob's lair, which of course indicates that the story line for The Return of the King is already screwed up.&gt; The funny thing, is that without all these storyline changes, extended action scene `slow downs', and reused scenes from FOTR, Peter Jackson could have had plenty of time to follow the storyline created by Tolkien almost exactly, removing some of the longer speeches from the book, and delivered a much better movie to LOTR fans of the book as well as the first movie. Some LOTR movie fans would say to me that it's a great movie, and that it doesn't have to follow the book to be good, and normally I would agree. However, all this series of movies is now, is a stepladder for a mediocre director to make a name for himself by butchering a great piece of literature to fit his vision. In interviews he talks about how big a fan he is of Tolkien's works, and how he wanted to make these movies be as close to the books and stories as possible. FOTR did show that intention, however, The Two Towers did not, and in fact showed a bit of disdain for the original work. Characters are changed. Events are changed. The storyline is changed. How is this movie allowed to be called the Two Towers? In my opinion, this movie is terrible. Not as bad as say.Pluto Nash, but is an insult to any true LOTR fan. The special effects were great, but the rest of the movie (the substance of it) was trash. I should say that this movie does have one saving grace.and that's the character and creation of Golum. Probably one of the best CG characters I've ever seen, Golum definitely embodies the character from the book in mannerisms, actions, and attitude. However, I would attribute the success of this character to Peter Jackson, rather the great writing of Tolkien and an obviously excellent CG crew. P.S. This movie, or any of the LOTR series, should never be directly compared to the Star Wars Trilogy, as they are two completely different genres of movie making. Star Wars is a Sci-Fi fantasy, while LOTR is just plain fantasy. One has spaceships and laser guns, while the other has elves and dwarves. One Trilogy has affected generations of fans since it's creation and is an integral part of pop culture, while the other has p****d off literary fans while affecting only the lives of D&amp;D players living in their parent's basements. One has a great director, who created an entire universe out of his imagination, while the other has a director who pirated a great book, and twisted it to his limited vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without the special effects and battle scenes, this is a pointless film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? So many people spilling out so many superlative about this film, I may as well be the one who disses it.Fundamentally, this film fails in the same way as "Gone in 60 Seconds". In other words, if you're not into cars (or battle scenes, as is the case of The Two Towers) then this film is kind of pointless. It supposedly follows Frodo on his trail of adventures, but every single hindrance is a battle of some type.As far as I'm concerned, films are supposed to be the director and producer's interpretation of a script. They've made no attempt to interpret anything here. It's just battle scene after battle scene.Even the humour attempted is very poor. There is the play on the dwarf's height, which is over-done, it's stale. I must say that, for a film that's serious, the humorous moments should have been a lot funnier. I'm not expecting belly laughs all the way, but something to at least make me laugh a bit would have been nice.Anyway, I'm sure the whole world and his dog will go and see this film. For those of you want to be adventurous, try a different film instead. Try "Ring" (or "Ringu" as it's transliterated from the Japanese) which has far more suspense than this pile of cr*p.All in all, a waste of time of a film, except for Lord of the Rings fanatics and those who really don't know what the genre of film is supposed to be about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an overblown waste of money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's films worked best when they didn't take themselves seriously at all (as in the case of BRAINDEAD or MEET THE FEEBLES). His trilogy so far is indeed very well shot and edited (though each film so far could easily afford to cut at least an hour away), but the big mistake here is that the films keep wavering back and forth from silly stuff to graveyard stoicism.The battle scenes are overinflated CGI extravaganzas with lots to look at but nothing really interesting. I kept thinking of the film WATERLOO (the 1970 Sergei Bondarchuk version) and realized that the battle scenes in that 33-year-old film were actually better-filmed, more believable, and more enjoyable than here, where everything is fake - and definitely looks it. The music is unmemorable, as are the bland actors (except for the underused Brad Dourif and Christopher Lee of course, but these days the real talent is slowly getting replaced by the likes of "Viggo Mortensen" and "Liv Tyler") - but I digress.I'm not gonna stand on a soap box all night and rant about how silly this movie is and how the Tolkien and AD&amp;D fans (and I used to be one myself) will eat up every minute of this. However, I have to point out that it runs far too long, and the action sequences seem to just come and go without adding to the story in the least, just filler. Basically, all the characters are in the same situation at the end that they were at the beginning of the film... the whole movie is filler.I actually preferred the animated 1978 Bakshi version, in that it was much better paced and felt more stylized and less like a big cash cow. It's too bad that Bakshi never was able to finish his film, but then again he had about the same budget to make his film that the LOTR trilogy spent on wigs. That film actually had heart.In spite of the fact it was merely made to cash in on all the nerd-money not yet spent on computer games and "Warhammer 40k" pewter models, this film will probably sweep the Oscars... which in my opinion is truly sad, considering there were probably thousands of better movies made this year - but so few were widely seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002) **** Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Dominic Monaghan, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, Cate Blanchett, Karl Urban, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Andy Sirkis, Hugo Weaving. Filmmaker Peter Jackson continues the saga of J.R.R. Tolkein's sprawling trilogy of fantasy and yore in this second action-packed episode with our heroes conveniently split up with three storylines running through its audacious epic tone poem: hobbits Frodo and Sam (Wood and Astin) are reluctantly united with the coveted ring's former possessor Gollum (aka Smeagol), the desiccated, pathetic/apathetic swamp creature (voiced and computer generated image of Sirkis), who directs them to their destiny: Mordor, the intimidating land being ruled by the vile Sarumon (Lee); hobbits Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are befriended by the Ent, a giant walking and talking tree (and convenient environmentalist) (voiced by Rhys-Davies) that is actually a forest shepherd/peace enforcement spirit; and rag-tag trio of human Aragorn (Mortensen brooding convincingly), elf archer extraordinaire Legolas (Bloom) and dyspeptic dwarf warrior Gimli (Rhys-Davies, again) also en route to Mordor while protecting the kingdom of Rohan in the midst of their noble quest. Exquisite New Zealand locales, gorgeous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie, operatic score by Howard Shore (with able assist by Greg Laporta) and audaciously fierce computer generated imagery especially the violent battle sequences between the evil orc horde and do-gooders of Middle Earth. Small gripe: not enough Liv Tyler! One of the year's best and one of the best (new) franchises in film history; cannot wait until the last chapter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's basically all this movie is. It is a good film, almost as good as the first but it totally destroys the book.This is now a tale of men, not of Hobbits' it seems. Characters have been completely sacrificed for events and things thrown in that seem pointless.Arwen in this movie just seems like an excuse to make it fill the near 180 minutes. Treebeard and the Ents are handled fairly dreadfully, I want character driven stuff here but not a tree babbling on about nothing. Then you have Frodo and Sam. Yes, what happens to them is supposed to but it all comes out so quickly and ends that it all seems tacked on to just make sure we can have a third film.Now, this is not to say I don't like this movie. The acting is still very well done, the script is decent but nothing brilliant, and the cinematography and CGI work is wonderful. And the character Gollum was done perfectly by all. What a wonderful character.Good movie, flawed, bored me for a while due to lack of character interest, has more glaring holes than Fellowship, still a good film even if it is just a three hour action flick, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Middle of The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fellowship has broken, but the quest to destroy the 'One Ring' continues. Frodo and Sam must entrust their lives to Gollum if they are to find their way to Mordor. As Saruman's army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people and creatures from Middle-earth, prepare for battle. 'The War of the Ring' has begun," according to the DVD sleeve description, the film was "Nominated for six 'Academy Awards' including 'Best Picture'." "The Two Towers" begins with a reprise of one of the first film's worthiest recreations of Tolkien text, beloved Gandalf falling to his apparent death; then, the film outdoes its predecessor? again, and again, and again. The scene-stealing creature "Gollum" (superbly voiced by Andy Serkis) is an especially well-realized highlight. It was this chapter being so successfully received that insured "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy could be considered a classic.This installment is as well-produced as "The Fellowship of the Ring" (the three films were shot together); but, with story, pacing, and characterizations much more suited to epic cinema. Peter Jackson's direction is most outstanding, the use of Howard Shore's music is much improved, and Michael Horton is a welcome addition to the editing team. Even the alterations of J.R.R. Tolkien's original work are satisfactory; sometimes, we all must meddle in the affairs of wizards.********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As i go back and review all the movies i have seen so far in my life i had to write this one first. This is probably one of my favorite movies ever since i first saw it, it had been my favorite. I want to look in depth at this film and find out why i like it so much.After the first film i was excited to see what Peter Jackson could do to my favorite book of the series. The movie starts with Frodo and Sam lost and circling in the same area. They run into gollum, which is one of the best cgi created characters. He leads them out and into the dead marshes.That story continues up until they get out of Osgilioth. They meet Farimir and the rangers, they go to Osgilioth and then head towards the staircase, thats where they where that part of the story ends, but during this time several other stories are intwined. The stroy of Merry and Pippen who are captured by the Uru-kai and then run into the forest and meet treebeard and they try to convince the ents to attack Saruman and help fight the war. Also during this time it follows Aragorn Legolas and Gimli who try to find the hobbits bu meet with Gandalf who is a white wizard after his near death expirence they head to Rohan and free King Theoden from Sarumans wrath and flee to helms deep to fight Sarumans forces. This is the best part of the movie a roughly 45 minute long battle, witch is a massive siege its really cool. I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For better or worse Peter Jackson and team continued to release the second installment of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. For some, this brings great joy, for others, this brings dread at the thought of being dragged to another three hour escapade of traveling midgets trying to destroy some jewelry by their nerdy, obsessed friends.So there I am sitting down, eager to watch the next chapter in a movie trilogy based off of my favorite books. I enjoyed the first one so much that by the time this one came around I had no option but to, again, expect nothing but excellence. The bar was set, the standards were made, and they were already as high as they could be...and they did it again! Flawless execution in adaption, remarkable cinematography, convincing acting, exciting battles, great choreography and overall storytelling.This chapter in the series is the most action oriented. I mean sure, the last movie may have had the largest battle scene ever seen on screen today but "The Two Towers" was the one to actually go deep into the battle and really bring about a great war epic. This one incorporated a lot of eye candy for the typical everyday movie viewer. Yes, slashing, hacking, bow work, and massacres of bloody orcs aplenty! But don't let that fool you, it's also filled with an excellent story and expansion of character development.This time around the story focuses even more in on the world of men. It deals with men struggling to survive in a war that is quickly turning directly toward them. And while J.R.R. Tolkein's books dealt a lot with the half lings and their journey to destroy the One Ring, he also dealt a lot with man and their common struggles of power, love, and honor. He was after all a man himself...most of his writings in fact actually reflected his own life when it came to stories of men.I could go on and on about this movie; how the music captures the heart of Middle Earth, how the sets for Rohan (the mountainous land of men) looked so convincingly real and inhabitable, etc. But I'll stop it short and just let you know that this movie is no let down, just like "Fellowship" was no let down either. It continues to give justice to Tolkein's work and it's pulled off with style, integrity, and excellent workmanship. "The Two Towers" will inform the public of the wonderful work Tolkein did 50 years ago, and entertain even more.</fullReview>

I do not know how they managed to make the film this long with not much storyline to it. I would not recommend this, there is no point to it.I can't say much more about it as it is walking, more walking and a ring. I think how they made 3 films about the same storyline is beyond me. I think the books were just as boring, and can't believe the publicity they have got of how 'good' they are, they are not.

		<shortDescription>Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was about as interesting to watch as a dripping faucet. It doesn't do the book any justice. Perhaps the most irksome feature is the fact that the classic novel is so grossly tampered with in order to accommodate well-known Hollywood actors (particularly the character of Arwen, played by the poorly-casted Liv Tyler). If the idea is to incorporate more female characters, they did a terrible job, as the Arwen scenes basically involve overly illuminated close ups of her face contorting into various crying scenes. As for other female characters, Eowyn is decent but doesn't live up to what I imagined her to be like in the book (strong, steadfast), but at least she gets some coverage. Galadriel is wonderfully portrayed by Cate Blanchett but her role is minuscule. Anyway, enough of that. There were some good scenes, like when the hobbits meet Treebeard, and most scenes involving Frodo were decent although Gollum is way too cute to be anything like the book's version. Worm tongue is also weak (not creepy enough). So my main issues are poor character renditions and alteration of plot. Wish they'd stuck to the story more accurately instead of turning it into a cheesy soap opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indepted Fanboy's Love Letter to The Lord of the Rings: A Critical Essay on the Film Trilogy, Part Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(click on my name for Part One) Okay, that's that. Now for some deconstruction.First, to the visual side of The Lord of the Rings. Visually, it is indeed ravishing in every sense of the word. Its scale and technological wonders make it heaven on your eyes, and in every frame there are so many beautiful things to look at that with every viewing you notice something there that you never noticed before (something that defines any true classic). The design is so richly detailed and by turns shimmeringly beautiful and powerfully arresting that you feel like you can just reach into the screen and touch the rainforest treetops of Rivendell or Lothlórien, or smell the gritty underbelly of the almost dystopic caverns of Isengard. Much of this is due to the many spectacular New Zealand locations on which the movie was filmed ? indeed, Jackson's choices of locations were so beneficial overall to New Zealand's tourism industry that then-New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark stated, "Peter Jackson has done more for New Zealand's tourism industry than any man since Captain Cook!" Still on the visual aspect of The Lord of the Rings, overshadowing the sets and costumes are the indisputably awe-inspiring special effects. They have the same effect as the sets and costumes, however they overpower other technical aspects of the production when we learn there was much more at stake with the special effects. And the special effects are, it must be said, nothing less than special. In fact, what am I saying? To merely write them off as "special" is both an understatement and an injustice. It's almost as if Peter Jackson has made a 3-D movie that you don't need to watch while wearing those stupid glasses, to get the adrenaline rush that 3-D brings. The dragon firework; Frodo's blurred and almost otherworldly vision when he puts on the One Ring; the dormant demon erupting out of Cate Blanchett's Queen Galadriel when she sees the Ring; the river flooding Isengard to the ground; Mount Doom blowing its top and the tower of Orthanc collapsing to the ground, causing an earthquake after the destruction of the Ring; and the afore-mentioned showdown on the Bridge of Khazad-dum to name but a few. All become indelibly etched in your memory forever. And then there's Gollum (played to sheer perfection by Andy Serkis), the first completely lifelike (if that's the right adjective to use in relation to a non-human character) computer-generated character ever committed to celluloid. Gollum was the main reason as to just why the realism of the visuals in The Lord of the Rings was so critical to the outcome, especially in The Two Towers and The Return of the King, because he is the character through which the story's moral of how power corrupts is delivered. Visually, The Lord of the Rings is, to put it lightly, a dream come true.Another visual plus is Andrew Lesnie's exhilarating cinematography ? indeed, the effectiveness of the picturesque New Zealand locations in the overall look of the movie has a great deal to do with his camera and he deserved every gram of the Academy Award he won for Fellowship. Two photographic shots in the entire piece that never fail to leave me awestruck are the tracking shot of the butterfly flying along the caverns of Isengard then up and over the tower of Orthanc (despite that shot being mostly computer-generated) and the haunting mise-en-scene (following Arwen's (Liv Tyler) vision of Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) passing) of leaves floating over Aragorn's casket to show the withering passage of time. Sublime.Click on my name for Part Three!</fullReview>

And the war scenes were terribly boring...I felt like someone was twisting all nine of my piercings over and over and over again. The war scenes were just repetitive.

I'd bet the farm on that wicked sorceress to take both gandalf and saruman white hand man who wills the uruk-hai (elvish for negroes) to their deaths in what was one of the greatest siege warfare blunders of all time but only because superflamer white pony gandalf shows up and uses all of his magical powers to reverse braveheart's calvary-killing logic. classic siege warfare people. when your opponent pens himself into a defended corner, you don't throw your army right at him. you wait him out or run amok wherevertheheck else you wanna go. and you especially don't throw yourself at a king whose kingdom basically amounts to a hill with a puny castle and some wooden shacks on it. TRANSITIONS: the transitions and timing in TTT were as bad as the one I used to start this topic. it bounces around the action with little if any regard to transitioning. this was done right in the first part where when you switch locations there is a still shot or a zoomed out view of where you're going. in one part of triple T you've got Ent-riding to Frodo back to Ent-riding for no relevant reason at all. also on that Frodo part, where he's taken to Gondor, i was told by a book-reader that boromir's brother let's him go at the waterfall, a much more logical, consistent and not completely retarded decision. jackson gives us a jerk-around the mulberry bush and a visit from the buck-toothed dragon. this ain't about book vs. movie though. "3 hours of torture featuring Smeagol" is what i woulda called it or how about just "lord of the rings: the suck" and to think i was all hyped up after watching all three and a half hours of the fellowship extended edition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrid. I think that's the best place to start. This movie was the biggest disappointment I have ever had. The worst part was that for the first hour I actually thought they were going to follow the book. Then the pain began. By adding and changing scenes from the book, they completely ruined a good movie. Some people argue that if the movie exactly matched the book, people should just read the book. I argue that if they want to make up there own story don't try to remake a book by someone else. The things added to this movie were not put there to improve the story anyway. They just added a level of badly acted drama that the film did not need. Why they felt the need to change the story to emphasize the plight of Frodo and Middle-earth with bad drama I will never know. The whole movie is already bent on these ideas, so why they felt like shoving it down our throats is a mystery. Maybe they want to try for Oscars... I've got an idea let's do another close up of Merry's face full of determination...Another problem is the fighting scenes. These were insulting. There is a difference between unrealistic fantasy fighting, like in the first film, and in your face crap that wouldn't even be shown on MST3K. If you can just run over 10,000 orcs with 5 horses and be fine, why didn't they just do that in the beginning? Obviously, the orcs have no momentum and no ability to even hold a spear up against a horse...I could go on about the problems of this movie for much longer but instead I'll just say this. If you have invested any time at all into this series, do not watch this movie, because it is horrible and will only irritate you.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Hollywood kill every story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must say that I'm a log time fan of Peter Jackson and of Tolkien's trilogy (Oh, and by the way, excuse my English, I'm from Belgium). And I'm soooooo disappointed to see that such a master director (Braindead!!!!!!) has caught so few the spirit of the book. For me it's like the Bible. If you had to put it in film, you have to catch the essence, not to shoot every scene described. And that's the problem with Jackson's first two episodes of the Trilogy: it's a scene after scene movie, you don't have a leading line, unless you've read the books. Well, of course, the special effects are incredible (although I'm not as surprised as with "The Fellowship..."), and the universe showed is incredibly realistic... But don't you think that this is only some make up upon vacuum? And let's not talk about the camera points of view and moves, quasi never justified. (Except the 5 seconds during Aragorn and his horse get up after the fall during the embush of Saroumane's skirmisher Orcs, the camera is sort of shy, hesitating, interesting! Probably the best part of the Trilogy) Except the mono- dialogue of Smeagol/Gollum, which is stolen from the Pixar short which went out with Toy Story 2, the movie is very disappointing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, yet unengaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me just compliment everyone involved in the production of this movie for their ambition. This was a monumental project, and they get a lot of things right, unlike any other. But the things they get wrong are really wrong. Most of the blame falls on the director Peter Jackson. Yes, he did play a HUGE part in bringing this thing together, and his organizational skills amazing, but he lacks skill as a storyteller, and his roots as the director of The Frighteners and Braindead really show through. Although the images put on the screen are downright amazing, with the exception of portions of the Battle of Helm's Deep, I don't think I was ever really engaged during this movie (or Fellowship of the Ring for that matter) with any of the characters or the story. And this is a tough feat considering that the characters and story are very well drawn. But there's nothing really connecting the audience with the movie. It's like looking at a picture taken of the Mona Lisa. Although you see everything that is on the painting, there's just something missing when compared to looking at the real thing.Plus, in my opinion, there were some HUGE fumbles in my opinion. Gollum got downright irritating at the end of the movie. Ok, we get it, he's having a moral crisis. We got it the first three times you told us. Say it and move on. And the one part they got right--the Battle of Helm's Deep--was almost completely destroyed when they cut away to Merry and Pippin yackin with Treebeard. Couldn't they have done this a little earlier? And then intercut Helm's Deep with the tree battle. That's just plain filmmaking 101. When you're at the end (even in a movie without an end) you shouldn't be setting things up FOR the end. That's what the prior 2 hours was for.There's a lot more nitpicking I can do. And I know a lot of people will violently disagree with me. But just wait a few years. Or even for the second viewing. I think this is one of those movies where upon first seeing it, it seems really good, but the more you think about it, the more flaws just start jumping out at you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why the heck is everybody jocking this movie? Unless you're a diehard LOTR fan , I really don't see what all the big hoopla is for. Granted, the visuals in LOTR: TFOTR was unlike anything anyone had seen before and it was worth double the price of admission just for that, but honestly, I just couldn't get interested in the story. I do have to say that Christopher Lee's presence was awe-inspiring and the sets were breath-taking. I felt that ,visually, I was taken to levels I had never even imagined.But I felt that this installment didn't offer anything new. It seemed to only draw out TFOTR's worst flaw--endless exposition. This installment looked to me like a 3-hour montage. I didn't find anything particularly memorable, except the excellent CGI of the creepy-crawly dude (sorry, I didn't quite catch the name). It wasn't that there was bad acting--it was more like there was no acting, or rather, no opportunity to act. It seemed like everyone was either just doing a lot of staring "out somewhere" because the odds were so insurmountable, or that they were scuffling about in groups of twos or threes headed "just over the other side of that tall hill or mountain".Kudos to the LOTR movies for staying faithful to the books, but as a non-fan, (yes, I know, I am probably blaspheming) it all seemed rather tedious and silly. I thought it was bad enough that TFOTR ended with the Fellowship being chased by a crap-load of Orks (sp?) who are easier to kill than the buffalo in a particularly memorable episode of the Simpsons. I mean, jeez! Is this the world's most inefficient army or what?!?! These Orks are easier to kill than the "middle-eastern" armies in an early Schwartzeneggar or Stallone movie. There is just no element of danger. Everything seems just to gosh-darned easy. TTT ends with a good-guy army of 300 (and eventually some elves) taking on 10,000 Orks. You just know that the Fellowship will pretty easily overcome ridiculously impossible odds. Sadly, I could suspend my disbelief and therefore, I could not enjoy this movie.This movie gets the 3rd Bass gas-face!</fullReview>

It's a too simplistic guy buddy buddy story where there are few if any women. I'd swear that with all the faeries, blonds, midgets, small smooth kiddie faces that this movie was destined for gays.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Dull and Uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're not an avowed fan of J.R.R. Tolkein's novels, there's little way around it: "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is a snooze.By devoting an entire three-hour film to a plotless middle section of the longer "Lord of the Rings" story, director Peter Jackson may have satisfied true Hobbit-loving fans, but he has committed an unpardonable sin for other moviegoers. He has created an epic-length movie that is surprisingly dull and uninspired, devoid of any real forward-moving narrative thrust or characters who generate excitement or interest.There is one notable exception in the CGI-created character of Gollum. At once humorous and moving, Gollum is the heart of the film, and the screen comes alive whenever he appears.Alas, that provides only an hour or so of amusement. That means there are two hours remaining, and for non-devotees who enjoyed "The Fellowship of the Rings," those hours are interminable. Jackson assumes the audience knows the nuances and relationships presented here, and makes little effort to indoctrinate those of us who aren't sure which son-of-the-nephew-of-the-godson-of-the-wife-of-the-kindgom we should be rooting for.There is, without doubt, some real cinematic beauty here. For a few moments, the battle sequences really hold thrall, and the aforementioned Gollum is truly a wonder. But for those of us who have always wondered what the strong allure of Tolkein's world is for so many, "The Two Towers" makes the answer even less clear than last year's "Fellowship of the Rings." Undone by stilted dialogue, mostly colorless cinematography, and some unfortunately designed supporting characters who look like rejects from a Rankin-Bass Christmas special circa 1971, Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is epic alright. An epic bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good reviews aside, I sat through an incredibly choppy and badly-paced, eternally long and boring film with no characterization to speak of, one that essentially leaves us at the same place we were at the end of Fellowship of the Ring. No good character interaction, a CGI-Gollum that is blurry when he moves quickly--in fact, all the CGI is pretty hokey--and a final battle at Helm's Deep which, I just don't get it, it's really not all that special. Maybe the Extended Director's Edition will rescue this one the way it did Fellowhip. I hope so, but this film is more like a bad summer movie than it is a sweeping fantasy. The pacing is terrible, characters disappear, the dialogue is a hollow retread of the first first. Aside from one schizophrenic dialogue between Gollum and himself, we could have skipped this whole film. Certainly, the meager story on display here could have been told in two hours. A bore. A jerky mess. A shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too much of a "good" thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, up front, that I really liked Fellowship of the Ring a lot. But that movie was three hours long, as is Two Towers. Return of the King is three and a half hours. I understand Peter Jackson considers this to be "one" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended "special" editions) hour movie. That is simply excessive, IMHO. Anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason. When you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- I don't care how good the original was. Maybe Godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception. But FOTR and TTT are not that good.FOTR had a more captivating story line. It was about a small band of brothers on a difficult and daring quest -- to destroy the dangerous ring of power. TTT doesn't have as good of a story line. There is a fundamental problem from the start. It makes no sense that Frodo and Sam would be left to go to Mordor on their own. Why would all three of the fellowship's best warriors -- Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli -- go off to save Pippin and Merry, and not one of them stay with Frodo and Sam? This makes NO SENSE, and the fact that Tolkien wrote it that way is no excuse. Isn't the destruction of the ring more important, in the scheme of things, than saving Merry and Pippin? Why not send at least Aragorn with Frodo and Sam -- or send Aragorn alone after Merry and Pippin and send Legolas and Gimli with Frodo and Sam? What on earth were Frodo and Sam supposed to do when they got to Mordor on their own?Where FOTR was a story about a quest, a mission, TTT quickly becomes a tiresome story about a "war" between "good" and "evil." There are so many endless, repetitious, humorless pronouncements in this movie about the stakes of this battle that the theme gets very old very quickly. If I had been the editor I would have excised every line by Theoden, Aragorn, Treebeard, Sam, et al. about all that nonsense, cut the movie down to two hours and made it almost pure action.The forces of Saruman are presented as so relentlessly, unmitigatingly evil that they are hard to hate. The orcs (or uruk-hai, I assume that's the same thing) are slimy creatures like Jim Cameron's Aliens. They ride CG beasts that look like dinos from Jurassic Park. Sauron is some weird flaming eye on top of a black tower. The only human villain is Saruman himself, who has about two lines in the whole three-hour flick. I don't need a lot of motivation for the villains, but I'd like to get at least some idea of why they act as they do. Why do they fight? Why are they so evil? What's the point? Meanwhile, the good guys are all white, the men do all the fighting -- in fact boys of as young as ten or eleven are thrown into battle but not a single woman is. It's just a tiresome, cliched battle of "good" against a straw man "evil." Why are the good guys so humorlessly good while the bad guys are so insanely, relentlessly evil?I was led to believe that Smeagol/Gollum was the best CG character ever, but in fact he seemed less realistic than Jar Jar Binks and no improvement over the dinos from Jurassic Park. The only bright spot in the movie was Miranda Otto. I felt no tension in wondering whether Aragorn will choose her or Liv Tyler -- I assume he will choose Tyler, and think he is crazy for doing so.Oh, I forgot one other human bad guy -- this "Wormtongue" fellow. How hard is it to figure out a guy named "Wormtongue" is up to no good? That's as bad of a name as "Darth Sidious."</fullReview>

It was filled with endless clichés and unnecessary dialogue, almost like the writer needed to fill the gaps to make it 3 hours long.

The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think "Attack of the Clones" is a good film. Fans will accept the worst if it has the name Lord of the Rings or Star Wars attached to it. I thought the first film was weak--but the extended edition on DVD was truly beautiful.

		<fullReview>Very similar feeling to the first film. Certainly everyone can admire the effort and hard work that must have gone into making these three films. I have never read the books and probably never will, so I can't comment on whether the original material was worthy of praise, but as films, they are poor.I can only assume, by the large amount of hysterical praise both films have received, that people decide before even watching the film, that it is great or that audiences just wish to see special FX.Just like the first movie, there's lots of little sub plots going on, but for what reason, none of the external characters seem to have any purpose or add anything to the story. The complete mess of a story is virtually non-existent and by the end you realise after all the pompous procrastination you have a very simple battle sequence. What were the first 2 hours about ?The biggest crime of this film is that you don't care about any of the characters, nothing is explained really, none of the motivations of any of the characters seem genuine. In the end, you see that the main cast of characters basically are invincible, so who cares, they're going to win, there is no tension, no edge.The FX, which seems to be the main reason everyone is watching the film, range from very good to very average. The laughable tree sequences never really look real or believable. Parts of the battle sequence were comedic, they were so over-the-top.The bottom line is really if people were more honest and looked at this film or it predecessor without pre-judging it as a book conversion, they would see that although there's lots of FX and lot's of things going on, the film is a muddled mess and not really worthy of such high praise.</fullReview>

I hated all the worse because each scene was wonderful but the package was a brown paper bag of flaming (you-know-what) left on my door step.Jackson didn't understand that this is a book about fraternal love. The love of the ents for Merry and Pippen and the love of Faramir for Frodo. The love of Gimli for Legolas. He tried to make it about Arwen and Aragorn because he seems to think that we can't see men love each other and not be gay. He really beat the horse to hamberger.Most of all he ended both of the stories in the middle. He added a hour and a half of garbage in the middle and left off all the meat at the end.All in all I give this moive a 4/10. If he hadn't changed Faramir's character and had spent 1/2 hrs less on the faked love scenes and 1/2 more on the Ents it would have gotten a 8 or a 9. This movie suffers the unforgivable sin of missed potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a visual achievement, a screen-writing debacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment compared to FOTR.Too much of the film focuses on King Theoden, in which he is misinterpreted through constantly driveling, mamsy-pamsy lines.Too much of the film focuses on Eowyn, in which she is misinterpreted as a wallflower.Faramir's character is completely misinterpreted. In the movie, he resembles his brother, not the cool, contemplative scholar/soldier nor the shadow of Aragorn as he was well delineated as being in the book.Though Gimli provides some much enriching comic relief; by the end of the film, you get the feeling that he is used solely for comic relief.Sure, all the visual craft is there. (Yea!) And Gollum's script and dramatic posturing are even more impressive than the masterful CGI rendering of him. (Yea!) The Ents are wonderfully captured. (Yea!) (Though the rescripting of their activities was another disappointment.)I could rationalize the plot changes in LOTR, but as I watched this film, I was rationalizing a lot. My rationalizations stopped when the misinterpretation of Faramir, (and to a lesser extend) Theoden, and Eowen overwhelmed me into bitterness.I was expecting this trilogy to be one for the ages. My expectations are shattered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Like butter stretched over too much bread"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, I saw "The Two Towers" and have to say that I am very disappointed. Even for someone who is not exactly a fan of Tolkien's world or the fantasy genre, the "Fellowship of the Ring" stood way beyond this sequel. A massive storyline and an excellent dramaturge concept made the first part appear smooth as silk. Chapters like "The Treason of Isengard" or "The Bridge of Khazad Dum" will always be remembered throughout the movie community and have set a new standard in this genre of film.Now, "The two Towers" has literally NO plot, it seems that director Peter Jackson didn't have a clue about how he should start, unfold and end the story of this second part of the trilogy. Somehow, it now seems hard to believe that he was in charge of the first part... The sequence of Frodo and his fellows crossing the Marches, the exaggerated focus on the creature Gollum and tons of splatter-UrukHai-sequences are all a strange reminder of his previous movies Braindead or The Frighteners. The film reveals its entire structural weakness just by the fact that Pippin and Merry appear throughout the movie in one Neverending Story-like sequence which was mainly used as editing material.The only impressive point so far is Howard Shore's incredible soundtrack on CD (even better than the first one!) and not so much in the film, where it was poorly used - amazing tracks like "The Forbidden Pool", "Breath of Life" or "Evenstar" are played in slapstick-like Gollum &amp; Aragon scenes! Neither the old nor the newly introduced characters did have a chance to unfold properly. To put it in Bilbo's words: "Like butter stretched over too much bread".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, merciful heavens, what a horrid film! I had serious problems with Fellowship, but I was able to overcome it eventually, and enjoy the movie on it's own terms. But this... this....! To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was "Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers," so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece. I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,"Let's hunt some Orc!" (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!) but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself. Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect. That was mistake number one. Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book. Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess. Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that. Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is "possessed" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, "The power of Christ compels you!" Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him. Then there's the time that... Ugh! I give up! It's a shame too, because I've really liked Peter Jackson's work before this. I just can't fathom his need to turn Tolkien's work into his own. Sheesh, even Kubrick wasn't this bad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film, but nothing great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with an open mind, expecting to see something great, yet throughout the whole movie I was bored and uninterested. I've read Tolkien's books two times and greatly love them, but "The Two Towers" does not capture the beauty and sadness that is within the books. One does not want to leave the world of Middle Earth when reading the books yet I greatly appreciated seeing the ending of the movie.Peter Jackson's directing was very annoying and redundant. He sets up his 180's with no sense of space, at times completely breaking the over the shoulder shots between two characters causing the breakup in the space to occur when it should not. There were too many close-ups when there should have been medium shots and too many extreme long shots when there should have been only long shots. Landscape scenes were often framed with no characters or tiny specks of characters, it should have been filmed as many of the classic westerns were filmed, capturing landscape and characters within the same frame where we could at least feel as if we're there with them and a part of their adventure.Jackson does not create feeling through images in "The Two Towers," he relies more on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. The scenes with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum I would have enjoyed better had they been shown with more images and facial expressions from the actors. You can't rely on words to describe the terrible power of the ring, it has to be displayed with images. "The Fellowship of the Ring" comes close to doing this.The screenplay should have had a major rewrite staying truer to the book with more natural dialogue. Many of the lines would be spoken and fall flat. There was no projection or passion in the lines, they were too stilted. Joking in the middle of a battle should have been crossed out by the director, and the entire love story should have been deleted. Doing this would have left room for the many scenes that were left out from the book. The ending of this movie lacks in drama and suspense, I deeply wanted to feel drawn into it and expect the next and last adventure, but the only thing I wanted was to get out of the room.What I greatly saw spelled over the entire movie was "TIRED." The actors were tired and the director was tired, and this was just another movie to crank out. With every scene saying "OK, that's done. Let's move on," with no care or artistic appreciation of the true art of filmmaking. I don't expect much from "The Return of the King" next year and I don't expect much from Peter Jackson as he's too soft of a director to show the true grittiness of Middle Earth. He is targetting this movie more towards females and those who haven't read the books and not true Tolkien fans like myself.Overall it was a decent action film, with your typical fight choreography, one liners, Legolas and his unlimited arrows, and the good guys always coming out unscathed. "The Fellowship of the Ring" was excellent and this movie should have stayed more along the lines of that, with some improvements. On a scale of one to ten I give it a seven, because it wasn't all that bad and it wasn't all that good and at least they tried.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless ommissions and inclusions spoil an otherwise highly entertaining film (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Towers would have been a very good picture, if not a great one, if not for a few needless ommissions and intrusions. The Arwen sequence was included for no other reason than to give the highly overrated Liv Tyler screen time. There just doesn't seem to be enough of a reason to beef up her role. Yeah, sure, the reason commonly given is that it's supposed to give the female viewers something to watch, but it's not like the gals are bored with everything else that's going on. I'm not saying the romantic angle should go unplayed, just that it should be lavished with such loving detail.Aragorn's fake death was played for dramatic purposes, as if there wasn't enough drama in the story to go around and if there hasn't been enough fake deaths in the first film. Both of these sequences/occurrences squandered screen time that could have been used to include the Huorns (basically the reason the Ents were called Treeherders) and Shelob, the giant spider. The Huorns are instrumental in routing the Orcs at Helm's Deep; they are an important element in the story. In the film, the defeat of the Orcs wasn't terribly convincing since there were still hordes of them. There didn't seem enough of a reason for them to just turn and flee. A burst of sunlight wouldn't seem to be enough, especially since these Orcs were the Uruk-hai, specially bred to move about in sunlight. In the book, the Orcs were crushed between Gandalf's contigent and the Huorns, which make a lot more sense and would have made a much better movie. There was plenty of time to establish the Huorns if not for unnecessary dream sequences.Shelob, the spider, was also ommitted for no clearly good reason. Presumably, Shelob will be featured in the the third movie (won't there be enough to take care of in the third movie?). In the book, Frodo seems to be mortally wounded by her and goes into a sort of coma, yet one more time the fake character death card will have to be played (making Aragorn's fake death seem all the more excessive) but at least with Shelob and Frodo, it's warranted and would have made an astounding finish to the film, as it did the second book of Lord of the Rings. (It probably inspired the less-than-happy ending in The Empire Strikes Back and look how good a film that was). It also would have given Samwise (and thus, the Hobbits, who have thus far been little other than "the little people) his moment to shine, as he takes on and defeats Shelob. I disagree there wasn't enough time. For one, as I said before, I don't think the time was spent wisely in telling the story; for another, an extra half an hour to 45 minutes would have been sufficient. Judging from audience reaction to the film, very few would have minded an extended film. Oh well, it will have to wait till the third film. But imagine the anticipation for Return of the King that would have been created if Shelob was included in Towers. Instead, it will just be something that happens in the third film that's quickly resolved (it will have to, I imagine, if the rest of the story is to be told with any sort of efficiency).Also, the whole Faramir plot was a total, total, hack job that I don't even have the heart to comment on right now. Overall, a severe disappointment. The major bright spot was the performance of Andy Serkis/Gollum, truly an astonishing development in the world of CGI; he makes the severe disappointments of this film almost bearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations when going to see this film so as you can guess my disapoinment was insurmountable. I watched as my expectations crumbled onto the theatre floor and nestled next to a box of half eaten popcorn and spilled soda. I tried in vain to put it back together but it slipped through my fingers like sand. I slumped back in the theatre seat and surpressed sleep. I watched Elijah Wood's strugle with his one expression and attept at Homersexual flirting with Sean Astin, the miscast fat American. The dialogue sounded like it was being excreted. The dwarf is now just comic relief in the tradition of jar jar binks. I had to shut my eyes every time Peter thrust the camera in Aragorn's face. Golumn was horribly unrealistic. Puppets look light years better when used properly. I want to believe what I see. The line to the effect of "I hope someday someone will write a book about us" had me cowering under my seat in embarrassment. The battle scenes tried to be too flashy and as a result you can't get a scope of the battle or see what's going on. The fact that its rating is almost nine says almost too much about todays generation (to which I am also part of). LOTR above Citizen Kane? come on! It is just Blockbuster drivel from the Hollywood machine. You can only take this film on face value, there is no depth. I say go back to Braindead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how this film could have gone so wrong but it did. All the power and heart of the first film (The Fellowship of the Ring) is completely gone. It's like Peter Jackson took a few weeks off while George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came in and took over direction for him. These two directors can be good and even excellent at times but have the habit of pleasing the masses too much. The great thing about The Fellowship was that it was original and not full of Hollywood clichés. With The Two Towers Peter Jackson seemed hell bent on filling it with nothing but Hollywood clichés and wiping away the integrity of The Fellowship.The only thing interesting in this film were the trees that walked and talked, but even they got a little tiresome especially since one of them had R2-D2 and C3-PO (Yes, I'm aware that's not their names. It's sarcasm - see George Lucas reference above.) in it's branches for a majority of the film.This film was a real disappointment, but I have hope that the Return of the King will be better. A part of me hopes Return is just as bad because if it's good then when it comes time to buy the movies I'll be left without a middle. If Return is bad then I can just buy The Fellowship and just use my imagination to fill in the rest. </fullReview>

I realize that many people like the Lord of the Rings, but to me, and to alot of people I know, this was just 3 hours of BLAH BLAH BLAH. "Middle Earth" is a pretty creative idea, but I really think that this movie delivers too much of a good thing. "Aragorn" "the Mountain of Mordoor" "Orcs".

Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books). For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche. From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.The only interesting character was Golum. He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.The dialogue in this movie offered nothing. It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.Well. I don't want to think much more about this movie. I think it was terrible. The fighting scenes and animation were cool. Perhaps the "acting" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, yet unengaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me just compliment everyone involved in the production of this movie for their ambition. This was a monumental project, and they get a lot of things right, unlike any other. But the things they get wrong are really wrong. Most of the blame falls on the director Peter Jackson. Yes, he did play a HUGE part in bringing this thing together, and his organizational skills amazing, but he lacks skill as a storyteller, and his roots as the director of The Frighteners and Braindead really show through. Although the images put on the screen are downright amazing, with the exception of portions of the Battle of Helm's Deep, I don't think I was ever really engaged during this movie (or Fellowship of the Ring for that matter) with any of the characters or the story. And this is a tough feat considering that the characters and story are very well drawn. But there's nothing really connecting the audience with the movie. It's like looking at a picture taken of the Mona Lisa. Although you see everything that is on the painting, there's just something missing when compared to looking at the real thing.Plus, in my opinion, there were some HUGE fumbles in my opinion. Gollum got downright irritating at the end of the movie. Ok, we get it, he's having a moral crisis. We got it the first three times you told us. Say it and move on. And the one part they got right--the Battle of Helm's Deep--was almost completely destroyed when they cut away to Merry and Pippin yackin with Treebeard. Couldn't they have done this a little earlier? And then intercut Helm's Deep with the tree battle. That's just plain filmmaking 101. When you're at the end (even in a movie without an end) you shouldn't be setting things up FOR the end. That's what the prior 2 hours was for.There's a lot more nitpicking I can do. And I know a lot of people will violently disagree with me. But just wait a few years. Or even for the second viewing. I think this is one of those movies where upon first seeing it, it seems really good, but the more you think about it, the more flaws just start jumping out at you.</fullReview>

If you haven't read the books (heck, even if you have...) and believe that the Lord of the Rings is your typical superficial, without a shred of subtelty Good vs. Evil story and that the upshot is that some short people need to throw a ring in a volcano, and that entertains you, then you may enjoy this film.If your looking for something more transcendent you will be disappointed. The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in. Why aren't they more up-front about this?Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that Peter Jackson seem to believe that Middle- earth is somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy or on board James Camerons Titanic. Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it "bigger and better". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he "spice it up" with a "dramatic" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like "Look it's the king!" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of "fun" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrilege (Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has desecrated the Lord of the Rings of Tolkien. The first part, being The Fellowship Of The Ring only had fault in that it missed out much of the story, and although it is understandable that a movie does not have to to build on characters, some important events had also been left out. I for one, would have loved to see Lothlorien's beauty.The Two Towers, however, has gone a step further. Not only has much been left out, but even more has been changed significantly. Too many changes have been made so that the end result has drifted far from the true story of the LOTR. Aragorn never fell down a cliff...The Ents never refused to fight after the gathering...the King of Rohan was not 'possessed' by Saruman, but was blinded by Wormtongue. Too far has this movie's story strayed from the original. The ring NEVER went to Gondor. Faramir was a honorable man from the start. Whatever happened to the Path of the Dead? Not providing background for a character is understandable, not only due to the fact that the movie has time constrained, but also, it would become too long-winded and boring. But to change the theme and style of an epic story of this history is simple sacrilege in its basest form.I may be overly hard and unfair, but I can see absolutely no reason that the makers could have had to change these details. If you don't agree with me, it is likely you haven't read the book. My advice...go and read it. It is worthy of more honor and respect than these movies accord it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Made Utter Waste of Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the more boring and pointless films of all that I have seen. The viewing experience consists mostly of cheering for the cuter creatures and hoping the worst for the ugly noisy ones, otherwise there's not much to think or care about. Both sides rely on magic and violence to achieve their goals but apparently we are to care more for the cuter quiter ones and apparently for that reason the story is told from their perspective. Fortunately, much of the scenery is attractive and provides a welcome distraction from the otherwise pointless marching about. Unfortunately, the film drags on forever. Best to have a cup of coffee rather than coke and popcorn with this one. You'll need it to stay awake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I walked out of the theater disappointed and angry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie this disappointing since The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I have defended the first Lord of the Rings against Harry Potter's fan, against people who don't believe in To Be Continued in movies, or people who just hate the fact that the first movie starts out with blank black screen for almost one full minute. I love the first movie to death.Don't think that I expected too much out of the Two Towers. I expected so little and they gave me even less. The fact that the movie is long is never a problem with me. However, why is the Two Towers long? Can it be that the director keep focusing on mountain range, and sky? Why? We know that mountain and sky existed, we saw them before. If it's a little, may be I can understand. But it's sad when I feel that I can show all the story element in one hour when the movie took three without a reason to.One of the thing I hate the most about the movie contain a tiny little spoiler that won't ruin any big surprise. The King lost his son and said that a parent should never have to bury his child. How cute. Yet at the battle, they have children fighting the war against Saruman's army. How does that make sense? Little boys (as young as 10 from the look of it) can fight war better than Grown Woman who hid cowardly in the cave? That's insulting to both the male and female gender. It's a very sensitive subject, so why tackle it when the book didn't have anything about that on it.The movie turn from something that is deep and look like a classic in the making (the Fellow Ship of the Rings) to something that is boring, long, and senseless. Oh, and the Gollum. The so-called most realistic CG animated character ever. I think he was pretty cool at first. But there is one scene where he was talking to his other self. Instead of showing the two version of him, they keep switching the camera and only have one Gollum on screen at the time. What was that about? I thought this thing was make by computers, why not just make two of them or have it talk to its reflection or something? I feel that I am very fair for giving this movie a low score.</fullReview>

Joe Dirt was a rare spectacle to behold, a movie which could actually decrease ones intelligence and had the overall humor value of a public abortion. The Two Towers although lacking in Joe Dirt's humor extraculations, disgraced the image of American cinema with a 3 hour bombardment of homosexual midgets, talking trees with beards and a 40 minute feud between a group of dirty hippies and Rosie O'Donnell look-a-likes whose battle plans were written by Barnie the Purple Dinosaur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where were the towers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems to me that over a century of film-making and thousands of films later, most have still not understood that books and literature are one thing and that movies are quite another.Just because Mr. Tolkien wrote three books, does not mean there have to be three films. It could have been two and it could have been five! We're watching and listening to the story, not reading it! The intensity of the senses applied in film-viewing is completely different to that which we apply in reading books, just as reading a novel has us differently poised to when we read poetry, or when we look at a painting as compared to admiring a sculpture.For a start, Mr. Tolkien may, rightly, have entitled the second part of his trilogy "The Two Towers" and may even have made some reference to two such towers; but, what reference, if any, does the film make to one tower, let alone two??? A good title for a book does not, necessarily, make for a good title for a movie. I would have called this something like "Preparing For The Great Battle". After all, we all know the movie isn't really a movie; that it's only an episode, so why not give it a title more befitting an episode.If you're going to take concepts described in literature and adapt them to film, then, consider the mind... Consider the intelligence of the viewer. If Tolkien conjures up images of an enchanted forest, make them just that: images of an enchanted forest. Trust the viewers' imagination and intelligence. Trees that walk and talk come off far better in Ralph Bakshi's animated version - if only because, as it is all cartoon, there is no stark sudden contrast between the realistic and the unrealistic. There is nothing magically genial (certainly nothing realistic) about Mr. Jackson's version of Beardtree and his Ent mates who, instead, suddenly turn a slow-moving overlong believable production into a slow-moving overlong UNbelievable cheap-looking film.Long epic battles read well, but they translate poorly onto screen. One of the reasons why Gladiator was such a delight to watch is that the opening battle was turned into short sharp memorably effective punch. What could anyone describe as memorable about the battle in this movie?? I'm sure it'll give those who believe that films are intended as a prequel to video game spinoffs great satisfaction to know they'll be swinging swords and killing Orks for hours and hours, JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIE!Watch Mr. Bakshi's animation (6 out of 10). In two hours, he'll give you the full sense of the first two books in Tolkien's trilogy, directly and unpretentiously. If you want anything more than that, or you just want to know how it all ends, you'll simply have to read every last word of that thousand-page Trilogy.This film is worth 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action movie based loosely in Tolkien's world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: before seeing this The Two Towers, you should rid yourself of the notion that it can compare to the novel. Film translations of novels rarely do, and this is no exception. Now that you have that out of the way, you can prepare to be visually stunned by one of the most magnificent motion pictures I've seen, and be disappointed by the script that ruins it.Yes, that's right, the script that ruins it. The Fellowship of the Ring was ambitious. It was true to the text, as much as a film so "hollywood" could be. It was true to Tolkien. It wasn't about the Uruk'hai combination of Orcs and Goblins, or Aragorn swinging swords, or Legolas shooting arrows - it was about a delightful cast of characters, all united in a common goal. A fitting sequel to this film would be delightful. Instead, we have The Two Towers, an action movie in Middle Earth's world, with a story similar to Tolkien's text. Packed with one-liners, epic battles, special effects, and (believe it or not), explosions, The Two Towers is every war movie you've seen, set in a fantasy background, redeemed only by the most beautiful cinematography to grace the screen this year.Andrew Lesnie saves this film, plain and simple. His camera shows perfectly how hopeless every character in this movie feels, or, are told they should feel. His frame is dark and dismal, in green, blue, and grey through the bulk of the three hours - a great contrast from the bright colors of Fellowship. In the first film, the characters showed us hope, and now, they show despair. The Helm's Deep battle is magnificent to look at, but really, the rest of the film builds to it. Lesnie probably should not get all of the credit for this, as Peter Jackson's directing is superb in its own right. Jackson is unafraid to use all of the screen, and with the use of sweeping airborne cameras, he uses sometimes three or four times the size of the screen.The computer animation is first-rate, and there were times when I knew what I was looking at was false, but could not tell. Gollum's character is entirely computer animated, and provides the most interesting character in this film - in fact, one of only two. Gollum is a split personality - his entire being wishes to have the ring, if you'll recall from Fellowship, but half of him wishes to help Frodo and Sam, and the other half wants to take the ring for himself. I'm not sure if each personality has a name, but Frodo calls him Smeagol throughout the movie, so I would assume the good half is Smeagol, and the evil half is Gollum - the film is not clear on this subject. Either way, Gollum/Smeagol talking to himself, across personae, provides the single best scene in the film. Quite unfortunate that a host of human actors could not reach the emotional intensity of a series of zeroes and ones.The other interesting character is Theodan, King of Rohan, played quite well by Bernard Hill. He is the only face in the film that truly captures how bleak the future is, epitomized in a scene before the epic Helm's Deep battle. Theoden realizes that his army has no chance of defending their last stronghold, but has no other options. His talent should have been served with better writing. That would truly be something.The script is your standard action movie fare. Dialog is swift, contains few details, and is rushed along to the next action sequence. Elrond and Arwen, the elves, return for a short while in this chapter, which has little purpose in this film. No doubt their scenes are more poignant in the extended version, which will be released next Christmas season, and, no doubt, be the same drivel we've seen in this "shortened" version.I look forward to the extended version of this film. I have low expectations, if the scenes we have here are the ones they decided not to delete, I'm not sure I want to see the ones they took out. However, where The Fellowship of the Ring earned three and a half stars from me, the extended version gets four. Maybe The Two Towers' extension will get three. I hope we're just being teased with The Two Towers, because I have high expectations for The Return of the King. It would be a shame to see a project that started so ambitiously fall to the formula of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One year ago, I thought FOTR got bashed too easily while it was actually a very decent flick anyone could enjoy. This one doesn't achieve anything at all. Hardcore Tolkien fans (or anyone who's actually read the book) will be very frustrated to see the appaling rewriting job done here while newcomers will just be confused.Seeing the good rates this movie gets, I can only guess most viewers were stunned by the visual effects and they were right to be. _Most_ effects are great (the sheer scale of the armies is incredible) but on the other hand, you get very poor inserts, Gandalf's beard is almost falling off at times and I'm not sure I want to comment Theoden's metamorphosis.Character development is virtually non existent since most characters are defined by one dumb catch phrase and idiotic exposition ruins some potentially great scenes. A few characters are still very nice, such as Gollum (the only reason I didn't give 1 to this movie), Eowyn or Sam. But Eomer's sorely lacking and don't even ask me what Arwen is doing in this movie (or why Haldir shows up at helm's deep). The writing choices made here are a real betrayal to Tolkien's work (I'm not talking about cosmetic stuff like some minor missing scenes from FOTR but about some really deep changes made to the characters and events).The greatest flaw of this movie is its definite lack of structure: there's no real beginning nor ending, it needs the 2 other movies to stand. I think that's a really poor choice, deciding to cast aside potential viewers who didn't see the first flick.Would I recommend it to people? No. Would I tell them not to see it? Neither, because that's the kind of movie where everyone gets lunatic and so, you'll have to make up your own opinion but as far as I'm concerned, it falls short of being one of the most boring movies ever.</fullReview>

By keeping the basic elements of "Fellowship", i.e. dozens of fantasy clichés - from "Excalibur" to "The Neverending Story", and adding a large dose of Western, i.e. lots of boring combat sequences - Indians vs cowboys Middle-Earth style, and also soaking the film in slow motion melodramatic sequences.This a good definition of generic plastic Hollywood storytelling, a kitsch mix of "Willow", "Braveheart" and "Titanic", which again lasts too long at 3 hours.

		<fullReview>I picked this up because frankly there was nothing else to rent at the local video place and I expected it to be bad but not as terrible as it was. Most of the "great" reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely "eye candy" to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level. I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture. Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout. The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the "heros" should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs. Gosh, is this made for teens? My grade: D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both in relation to the book and as a movie in its own right, The Fellowship of the Ring was far better. If The Two Towers is a must-see nevertheless, it is thanks to the computer-generated character of Gollum. He comes out incredibly life-like, which is even more remarkable as that creature does not resemble anything on earth, at least not in appearance. This is the one point where the movie actually surpasses the book. I am willing to forgive the addition of a loincloth to Gollum's body (naked in the book) because I understand that otherwise there would have been trouble, especially in the USA.If for the sake of action Moria was overdone in The Fellowship of the Ring (a scene reminding me of Indiana Jones), here the same happens to the Battle of the Hornburg. Among the changes to the plot the one that annoyed me most was Faramir's taking the hobbits as far as Osgiliath and to release them without obvious reason. Boromir was Faramirized in The Fellowship of the Ring, recognizing Aragorn as his King ("king" being his last word - oh, how I loathed that!), and now Faramir is Boromirized. (I am afraid in The Return of the King Denethor will be Sarumanized.) Aragorn's fall from the cliff, leaving him presumed dead for some time, was an unnecessary addition; could it be that in Part III his ride on the Paths of the Dead will be omitted instead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to turn a masterpiece into schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and has an appreciation for the depth of characters and the richness of the dialog will be absolutely appalled by this screen play. I've seen movies where the writers/directors have taken "artistic license" with the original story, but I've never appreciated how deeply a story could be debased until I saw this film. The screen writer did to this movie what a 10 year old with finger paints does to a masterpiece painting.Most of the new characters introduced in The Two Towers - Faramir, Theoden, and Treebeard - were dumbed down and converted to antagonists, whereas in the original story, each was a character of unique nobility and wisdom. I found myself shaking my head at the end of the Entmoot, groaning at Theoden's decision to ostracize Eomer and send the civilians to Helm's deep, blinking in disbelief when Faramir stuck his sword into the Ring around Frodo's neck.It's not easy to capture the majesty and integrity of Tolkien's characters on film, but given that the story ranks as one of world's greatest, the writer and director should at least have treated it with some respect, and not defiled it the way the orcs defiled the king's head at the Cross Roads in Ithilien (which was not in the movie).For those moviegoers who have not developed a deep appreciation of Tolkien's masterpiece, the Two Towers is an extravaganza of special effects and brilliant imagery, and a great action movie. But for those of us who revere the original trilogy, we'll probably have to wait another 20 years for a true-to-the-story remake.</fullReview>

It is just a different movie and in the end, falls flat with its overblown battle scenes and contrived story-telling. After watching the movie, ask yourself: where's this film's Mines of Moria? Unfortunately, there isn't. Helm's Deep was just a big mess, especially the part when Aragorn and Gimli swung themselves from the trapped door onto the gate of the keep, in order to slow down the Urak-hai. Merry and Pippin's story-line with Treebeard and the Ents was just a waste of time and they should had either cut thte scenes to a bare minimum or spend more time developing it. Faramir was another popular character that shows up late but was vastly under-utilized. In the end, we get little from his character, kinda like Boba Fett in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. The only saving grace from the film is Gollum who I thought was a terrific CGI character. Miranda Otto is also easy on the eyes and I wished she had a larger part other than looking good. So save yourself the 9 bucks and rent it next August when it comes out on video/DvD. 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

But Part 2 almost succeeded with me walking out of the theatre from boredom. I can state the positive aspects easily- the film has wonderful scenery and special effects. So, if that is the limit of your appreciation of films, then you will love the movie. But all that is left is disappointment and painful boredom. Let's begin with the bad acting- everyone overacts, looking too serious at the wrong times and to whimsical and emotional at equally wrong times. The movie and the director makes the assumption that the audience immediately empathizes with the characters in the movie, without proper build/development. It is quite presumptuous of the director to think that most people are as in love with these characters as he is and the loyal fans of the books. Next, there are way too many close-ups on the faces and eyes of everyone, showing every pimple and every gray hair... do we need this? This also goes double for the orks and bad guys- how disgusting do they have to be? Way overkill- the director tries too hard to exaggerate the grossness. These close-ups are made more painful from the slowness of the filming, which is 3x longer than normal movies- it is like each expression is in slow motion. Combine this with tortuously long dialogue- each character carries on forever it seems expressing thoughts that are "force-fit" into Shakespearean prose. This makes the film incredibly ponderous and worsens the overacting. Some further points of disgust for me is the time and focus on the hobbits and making them out to be such a vital part of the good guys winning- newsflash, they are all completely useless and trouble-making and it's annoying and humiliating to have them all play such important roles. Other things that bugged me bigtime is the fact that Gandolf exhibits little or no sorcery or magic in all 3 films! All he does is make speeches and talk in a deep voice and use his staff as a sword- what is so powerful about him? Yawn. Another stupid aspect is the ratio of bad guys to good guys during the battles- it's like 100 to 1. And the bad guys each look 10x bigger and stronger, yet are felled by a single arrow in the shoulder? Please. The worse thing of the 2nd and 3rd films is the introduction of the special effects Gollum creature, whose irritating raspy monologues occupies a large portion of both films- I felt incredibly stupid paying attention to this computer animated creature whine and eat fish. Finally, the whole trilogy is about a silly ring which is utterly ridiculous and especially difficult for the audience to believe as so important and earth shattering. And as others have pointed out, the ring (and hobbit) could have been easily flown via Gandolf's winged creatures to the fire pit in an hour and avoided all the battles and quests and pointlessness. To any who not seen the film- avoid this slow-moving yawn fest at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have voted this film as 'awful' because if you have not watched the first film and are forced to watch the second, then everything is very confusing, I have to write an essay on this film and I have NO IDEA what is going on, or who is who, and what the ring actually does. If anyone can provide a decent explanation of this, then I would be very grateful as you might save my English grade. My main Questions are: What does the ring do? Why is it so special? Why do hobbits have it? What the hell is Gollum? Who is Shmeadle? are sauran and Saurman the same person? who are the good guys and the bad guys? Who is Gandalf? and Why did they battle each other in the first place?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dislike these films. I dislike all this films with witches an wizards and other inhuman beings which are demonstrated to be good and the demons are mostly primitive. Humans should not turn to such kind of supernatural forces and produce fairy stories for entertainment. I went into one of the three "ring"- films with my children, who were already half grown up. After half of the film I left the cinema because I could not stand any longer this high quality-nonsense. In spite of the vast occult imagery, these movies and their literary counterparts are being praised by some professing Christians to be an allegory for the Bible story in which the good prevails in the end over the bad. World magazine's review is titled "Powerful Rings" and says that the "movie version of Tolkien's book speaks to today's culture." Unfortunately the today's culture is a very doubtful sort of thing. What about the increasing preference of our Youth for the occult, for violence and obsessions? Is the Lord of the Rings harmless fantasy or even a wholesome Christian allegory? I think neither nor. If the film or the books contained Bible truths it would not attract so many atheists. If they attract Christians it is apparently because these sort of Christians have a liking for the belief that wizards, hobbits, dragons and the kind could be of the good buddies, maybe also a liking for pagan contents which also had the author Tolkien. His books are filled with occult imagery, such as witches, goblins, warlocks, wizards, fairies, and such things; and though these are strongly and unconditionally condemned in the Bible, they are often portrayed as good and desirable by Tolkien. Many of the heroes of the Lord of the Rings, in fact, are of doubtful nature. The books became in the sixties and seventies popular with the generation of drug headed hippies. When Tolkien was eight years old, his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, and he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, "I'm a devout Roman Catholic." Catholics have a different approach to the Bible as Protestants as well as a different approach to pagan symbols and cults. As a professor of literature at Oxford University, Tolkien specialized in Old and Middle English and loved ancient pagan mythology. His first fantasy novel, The Hobbit, appeared in 1937, and The Lord of the Rings, in 1954-55. Several others were published later, some posthumously. Like Tolkien Lewis and perhaps most of the so called Christians they did not accept the Bible as the infallible Word of God and he picked and chose what he would believe about the New Testament, rejecting it in parts. And like Tolkien, C.S. Lewis loved at least some things about Catholicism. He believed in purgatory, confessed his sins to a priest, and had the last rites performed by a Catholic priest.The books depict the calling up of the dead to assist the living, which is plainly condemned in the Scriptures of the Bible as every Protestant knows. Sympathy with the devilish is not so much fostered and demonstrated as in the dominant occult Harry Potter series but Tolkien's fantasies are certainly not of a Christian spirit. Some Christians regard them as potential dangerous message. Films are to a younger unexperienced audience always a strong influencer. In a film review this should also be taken in consideration. For agnostics the films should be rejected as they depict the bad as something too less subtle. The enemy of man is not outside him, it is inside him and everybody should know this. In US schools young students massacre their fellows, there are no Hobbits who come to give the defenders of the right and good a helping hand, no flying by of Harry Potters. The bad is inside man and we have to take means to keep it down and promote the good. Films like that are not helpful. In his last interview in 1971, Tolkien stated that he did not intend The Lord of the Rings as a Christian allegory and that Christ is not depicted in his fantasy novels. Tolkien said, "But that seems I suppose more like an allegory of the human race. ... they (the humans) struggle on, almost blindly in a way" A blind struggle? It is going to be a blind struggle if we do not take care to which direction our offspring goes! Survival of the fittest? Are the good the fittest? May be, maybe not! Tolkien also said: "I dislike allegory whenever I smell it." He had definitely no Christian aims.Fantasy role-playing games are very influential today. Dungeons and Dragons, which appeared in the early 1970s, was based on Tolkien's fantasy novels. Tolkien certainly did get his ideas from pagan religions, and the message promoted in his fantasy books is strictly pagan. And so do the films. The morals in the books and films is of a very doubtful nature, it is primitive and not endurable. It can carry nobody to nowhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid movie; one of the year's worst films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a joke this so-called "trilogy" is. It's even worse than "Star Wars". Basically, this is just a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie. The only reason it's not treated like that is because it's based on a series of "classic" books, and it came out in December rather than the summer. The high box office total of this film (and the first one) show how dumb and guillable north americans are. It proves that all Hollywood needs to do for big box office for a film is put some cheesy CGI effects and pointless action sequences in it to send the people running to the theater. This film is really no different from similar stinkers like "Battlefield Earth" and "The Scorpion King". Gollum isn't all that impressive, either. I can't see why the Gollum character is getting so much praise... didn't people see "Attack of the Clones" or the new Harry Potter movie? Newsflash: it's already been done before! Basically, this is just a clever money-making machine. As you can see, the movie features an inexpensive, talentless b-list cast (with the exception of Sir Ian) in roles that just about anybody could play. That way, they could spend the rest of the money on the supposedly "awe inspiring" special effects (which i've already seen in a dozen other films hollywood has churned out this year). This film is far from awe-inspiring... those who consider it that obviously don't get out much. Anyone who prefers a movie with hobbits and wizards rather than real life, obviously leads a very empty existance. Go see a movie with REAL actors giving REAL performances instead of relying on god-awful CGI tricks. I honestly think in a few years time "LOTR" will suffer the same backlash "Titanic" did. Another thing I can't understand is how the critics have praised this one so much.. well, go figure, i guess.. BUT DON'T GO!1/10 - one of the year's WORST films, along with "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever" and "Left Behind II"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of THE worst films ever made. I would think Peter Jackson can't make films if I didn't see "Braindead" and "Bad Taste". Those films had low budget but they was made very well: dynamic, funnily, with good concept. There is different in cause of LOTR. All "LOTR" trilogy is bad but "Two Towers" is especially crappy. Cinematography is average, music is horrible (one lame theme in 2,5 h film) and absolutely nothing happens. And when finally Jackson starts with action scenes, he makes them possible worst. Battle scene is chaotic and stupidly edited; I didn't see what going on, where are good people and where are bad. Watching this film is total waste time and money. If you want good fantasy, watch better "Willow", "Neverending Story", "Excalibur" or "Conan the Barbarian". If you want good battle scene, watch "Alexander Nevsky", "Seven Samurai", "Breaveheart" or "Joan of Arc". 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should be on the worst 100 list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a difficult task; to bridge the gap between the introductory "Fellowship of the Rings" and the conclusive "Return of the Kings." But that doesn't take it off the hook for delivering a decent product. Tolkien's trilogy is an incredibly written story with a multitude of intricately woven plots and subplots. The films have dumbed all of this down into a simple fight between good and evil. Even the Star Wars trilogy had more depth to the relationship between the warring sides, the hero, Luke, was the son of the biggest, baddest guy of them all. And in the end we see how affected Darth Vader was by the fight for his son's Jedi power. "The Empire Strikes Back" ought to replace "The Two Towers as number 11 on this list. Every film-goer will acknowledge how difficult it must be to adapt a book, but when the book is so good, the worst thing the movie can do is make the story and experience of it mediocre. The Two Towers did worse than that; it degraded the struggle for Middle Earth to a few love interests, a wicked spell overturned by a gleaming white savior and two long hours of brutal violence. Perhaps the brightest part of the movie, or its dimlight, was Gollum's inner struggle between temptation for the ring and desire to do what is right. The other characters, indeed Mr. Tolkien's story itself, deserve to be developed with as much vigor as Gollum's has been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - since the movie is definately NOT the Two Towers (outside of the same character names and the fact there is a ring involved), the movie really needs to be seen without the Tolkien fanatics with rose-colour glasses. The movie STUNK! The acting was sub-standard (Gandalf 'fighting' with Saruman through Theoden was hysterically bad!). The plot was only loosely put together - actions of characters seem to come from nowhere (Merry standing up to Fangorn, Samwise's preaching, Aragorn's 'issues'). The actions of the characters were just bad, the fighting scenes - although spectacular in vision, were just sadly portrayed (Aragorn and Gimli 'jumping' into the middle of dozens of orcs and not getting scratched, horses ridding into the middle of 10,000 orcs and not one of the orcs seems capable of killing the horses, horses riding into 'swiss pikes' and not getting a scratch?????)on the good side - the cinematography was PHENOMINAL; the CGI is some of the best in movies today (you could barely tell gollum was not real); the orcs siege warfare was historically accurate (the use of ladders with people on them; the breaching of the walls; the use of the rams and it's security - very well done).Overall - movie 1/10; visual and historical 10/10 (but final rating must still be 1/10 - just a poorly done story).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor in places, but an enjoyable 3 hour diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something mildly offensive about people in this forum taking issue with `nitpickers'. This attitude is wrong because it takes as its assumption that a work such as The Two Towers is beyond criticism, and how dare anyone find fault with it?There are two threads to the pro- and anti- TTT arguments: those who compare the film with the book, and those who comment on just the film.A body of work such as Tolkien's trilogy is bound to have a plethora of devoted defenders, and their opinions on the divergence of the film plot from the books are valid. The issue I have against this argument is that a faithful reproduction of the books onto film would have been tedious: the council of Elrond from the Fellowship of the Ring was over 10,000 words long!; the battle of the Ents on the film of TTT took place in real-time, whereas in the book it happens in retrospect (arguably, like in the conventions of classical Greek drama, adding to the sense of surprise by having minor characters describe something that has happened in the past).Jackson's treatment of TTT is good, but not brilliant. The other breathless reviews of this film reflect an unquestioning readiness to be seduced by overwhelming spectacle. There are nevertheless some elements for which Jackson deserves praise: the rendering of Gollum into a genuinely pitiable character; the beefing up of Faramir's character and role (the antithesis of which works well in the book, but would have made this episode pointless in the film if he hadn't been seen to be a more aggressive character - probably a Jackson decision to darken Gondor's predicament prior to the climactic conflict in the final film); the warg battle and Aragorn's interlude; the suspiciously Arab-looking human allies of Sauron being both mysterious, mute and menacing; Grima Wormtongue's tears when he sees Saruman's army; and my favourite bit - the representation of Fangorn Forest as something mildly sinister and the genuinely quite sweet looking ents.The battle of Helm's Deep could have been shortened, though my main gripe is with the absolutely pointless introduction of Haldir and his doomed elf stormtroopers. Jackson's adjustments up to this point can be explained away under the protection of dramatic licence i.e. to speed the plot along, but what was the point of the elves? That they didn't appear at this point in the book is a minor point, what is unforgivable is that in an already over-lengthy battle scene, their introduction served absolutely no dramatic purpose. I would even go so far to say that it spoiled this episode: it pointlessly lightened the mood as the forces of darkness were closing in on the refugees and small force of human soldiers. Maybe Jackson has a thing about bows and arrows.On paper, the climactic battle of Gondor reads better than Helm's Deep, and I am hoping that the film of the Return of The King will be as thrilling as the literary version.Overall, TTT is a good film, but the Fellowship was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers.This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Each plot element was over-drawn out. It took 3 hours to tell what could have been told sufficiently and more interestingly in 90 minutes. The main plot elements were: 1) Frodo finds thats the ring is getting heavy 2) Saurons forces are rising 3) Pippin and Merry spend the whole movie in a tree 4) Gollum has 2 personalities. The use of helicopter shots became very irritating after the 15th use the technique in the 3rd minute of the movie. Also in the middle of the final battle sequence they kept cutting back to a bunch of trees talking, what an idea to keep the action flowing. The long battle at the end was the same thing over and over. Not to mention both sides had stupid battle plans. The humans defense wasnt even slightly planned out. It was totally unbelievable. Then the boring subplot with Arwen aerosmiths daughter, I mean really, who cares if she dies. She was in the first one for 5 minutes anyway.It is also very silly that this movie is already number 9 on IMDB top 250 movies of all time. I can easily name 10 movies much better than this. The only reason it is so high is because people want to have a little geek war between star wars and lord of the rings so the movies can have a higher rating. I contemplated leaving early as I started to fall asleep and I had to wake my girlfriend many times. Seriously dull movie.</fullReview>

Harry POtter had a story, and perfect actors and actresses. it was great for all children, but maybe not younger ones because of some of the gross scenes. that set will have 7 different stories leading to one thing. this, LOTR, has only one focus, and that is the exact same thin, destroy the ring. in all 3 movies, it is the same and gets boring.well, anyways, it sucked. i have never seen the 3rd one, i don't think, maybe i tried to forget it and succeeded.

		<fullReview>"The Two Towers" is certainly a good film, though, for me, it was not the best of "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy. I preferred "The Fellowship of the Ring", and "The Return of the King" blew them both out of the water. But TTT is still a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone.Being as there are fewer characters introduced, and less exposition for the story, the characters are not bogged down by starting a new story. My favorite plot line is the one that involves Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Gollum is amazingly animated. He is so realistic, and far outdoes Dobby from "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I also enjoy the relationship between Sam and Frodo. Jackson greatly portrays Frodo's descent as he begins to become consumed by the ring. The other plotline, involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer is still well done, though at times, I feel that some of it could have been left out. The flashbacks to Arwen seemed like they were only included to keep her in the memory of the audience.I appreciate Jackson's willingness to make this a good film, even if it means making sacrifices to the book. Tolkien purists will be even more disappointed with this film than the previous one (though you all probably know that already).A worthy film, one that I would recommend. 7 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as compelling as 'Fellowship'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the novels since I read them in 1998, I was doubtful when it was announced they were being made into a trilogy of movies. I didn't know if the books could be done justice on the big screen. When The Fellowship of the Ring first came out, I was awestruck. It was a breathtaking blend of fantasy, drama and action. I actually felt for these characters as they played out the history of Middle-Earth, and it's been a long time since any film moved me emotionally. I saw it eight times in theaters, each time noticing new details and nuances. Changes from the book were irrelevant; alterations were inevitable and the changes that were wrought did not detract from the experience, and added to the overall aesthetic of the film. I couldn't have been happier.When The Two Towers came out a year later, I could hardly be restrained from seeing it as soon as possible. Any thought that the movie wouldn't be as good as Fellowship didn't cross my mind; I had been spoiled, so to speak, by the first film. I came out of the theater that night disappointed at what I had seen. I was sure it was Lord of the Rings, but it had lost something. I watched Fellowship again, and contrasted the two films; there was something different. The characters were superficially the same, the action and cinematography similar, but there was something the first film had that the second did not; a spark, a feeling, a certain virility, that seemed to bring it to life, as if what was happening on the screen became somehow possible in real life. When I looked back to the second film, I was emotionally unengaged, intellectually cynical. I could not gain the suspension of disbelief that was so easy sitting through the first film. Their plight was too artificially produced and dealt with, their motivations unsatisfactory. The way the characters acted and interacted was melodramatic and unbelievable. I just didn't care about any of it anymore.This movie is comparable to films like Return of the Jedi or The Matrix: Reloaded. Sort of the same as the others, but not nearly as good, in a big way. I can only hope a better job is done with Return of the King.</fullReview>

Make the conflict a battle between good and evil, but don't identify clearly the moral value or purpose of either side. In fact, remove morality's essence altogether by eliminating the power of choice for your characters. Emphasize the corruptibility of men. Glamorize the supernatural. Dwell interminably on the preparations for and the wreaking of violence and destruction, on the fragility of hope and happiness. Name the scene of action: Middle-earth. Sound like an environment you'd care to envision? Would you "live" there? If so, fate alone will decide its survival and your own. You can visit this predetermined "paradise" by watching/enduring/suffering Peter Jackson's elaborately filmed adaptation of Tolkien's epic trilogy, which continues with "The Two Towers."I hold it is true that what is not worth contemplating in life is not worth contemplating in art. For its dismaying lack of meaningful moral definition, its pervasive pictorial ugliness, the quantity of its scenes of mind-numbing graphic violence, and its minimizing of the value of happiness, "The Lord of the Rings" films?including this one?ought to be shunned and damned.</fullReview>

I mean The Matrix (original) brought so much more to film than LOTR will ever bring. The Wachoski's bring amazing cinematography with great writing and a great story that is not already someone else's. Not to say there is anything wrong with remaking a great story into a movie, just that it doesn't bring anything new to the table. I agree that these films are good. I enjoyed them. However, that doesn't mean that they are great cinema. They are not. They are great entertainment. Period. For this movie to be rated so highly on IMDb just shows that this forum is not for people who really pushing the bounds of film making but only for those who like what is considered to be a blockbuster. The Matrix was not a blockbuster, although it was rated highly, but many other films are not. If the Harry Potter movies were made 30 years after they were then I feel that they would get this same reaction. I mean really think about that. If these films were made right after the books had come out and when they were just popular, would the movies have been as successful? No. They wouldn't have been. They would have been regarded the same way HP is. They would not have been given the Oscars etc. It just makes me sad that people don't look at the art of cinematography in the movies anymore. Many writers have written great stories that can be told in many mediums, but I feel that something extra needs to be added other than just tons of special computer battle scenes to make a movie great. This movie is not great. It is far from it. It is a mediocre telling of a great story, and although the battle scenes are phat as hell, the rest of the movie, including Orlando Bloom's atrocious acting are a disgrace to it. An 8.8 is much to overrated for this pop-culture infested excuse for cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confirmed: we'll kill your dream story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I came out from the movies after seeing this one, I was upset and annoyed like mad. I don't think any movie could've achieved that. This was supposed to be an adaptation of the story we used to read when kids. It was supposed to be beautiful and makes us happy. On the first movie they just skipped some really important parts and focused the plot on some random stuff they invented. On this movie, they confirmed they had no intentions on coming back to the regular plot... they stole our story and modified it for the masses. This one is specially bad because it just starts ignoring the important aspects of the story and starts cutting content for no reason. The movie is also extremely short and when it finishes you're wondering, well, what did just happen, did they really end it here? Did they really miss all that? Where are the happy parts where I can rest and smile for a while? All the 3 movies have this issue, everything's wrong all the time... this movie is not an exception, and it shouldn't be like that. This is not Lord of The Rings. Want a good story? Go buy the books, spit at this blasphemy. If you don't know the story, this movie will probably be OK... maybe a 6, the book is a hundred stars out of ten, and they killed it. But this was supposed to be an adaptation, and it's a really bad one. The only reason it has 2 stars is because well... graphics, money. I can't argue that... You can see cool stuff like Ents, but I could've seen that on a 3 minutes video and I would not feel disgusted like I do now only by remembering this thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Film in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in "dusk till dawn" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it was the fate of the 'middle film' in the series, but Two Towers suffers from excessive plot and excessive pulls to the heart-strings to match. It seemed that every character with at least a five minute span of character development eventually got their own democratic turn at dramatic lighting and sappy music with us all supposedly marveling at their remarkable valor as they marched into their next challenge. After about three or four turns at that and about an hour and a half into the movie, I began wondering when the intermission was going to be. The problem was, given very little time to get to know these characters, we began to wonder why we should care about their valiant acts or their noble deaths.I'm not sure that I can forgive the almost predictable, certainly tiresome, and problematically vapid bravado of the film to simply an excess of things going on. The beauty of the film and the worthwhile performances of the cast might have induced me to forgive the relative lack of depth or magic in this rendering, had I not felt that I was being clumsily and unsuccessfully manipulated at every turn.I very much enjoyed Fellowship due to a skill I saw in distilling Tolkien's complex world into a meaningful exploration of character difference and temptation, as regarded each character's current and historical relationship to the ring of power. This film continues to do so in the sequences that are perhaps the most rewarding, those involving the trio of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, a bizarre relationship but psychologically riveting. We understand the complexity of the task of Frodo through both his own tortured visage and the reactions of those around him. Conversely, the minute long introduction sequence between Aragorn and his new would be human love interest is hardly enough to inspire us to any level of emotional involvement, yet somehow we are supposed to believe that this two sentence exchange should be enough to carry the sub-plot through the rest of the film. There is simply far too much that happens in this film for us to even understand the depth of what is going on, and there are far too many times when we are left with the feeling that at this moment we are expected to be moved to tears. Whiplash is probably a better description for the reaction.Despite my disappointment in the Two Towers, I still do look forward to the final film. This film never relents in its lively and magnetic exposition of a rich other world. Despite its inability to rouse me to any heights of passion in the battle of good versus evil, I am left still anxious to watch 'what happens next'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trilogy continues, and it's just as good as the first...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...with even more action pumped in; the final battle sequence is an astonishing feat from Jackson and his team, making an entire fleet of Urk-Hai completely computer animated, seem totally convincing. And while the second part is exactly as long as the first, it's even more eye-grabbing with it's visual wonder, the scope of Middle Earth the most impressive thing about Two Towers (it's deserved of an Oscar). Another impressive feat is the computer animated creature of Gollum, a schitzophrenic, deformed Hobbit who finds Frodo Baggins his new master, alongside Samwise Gamgee, and he may just be the most compelling of the characters, along with the somewhat downsized role of Gandalf the Grey, er White, played still with skill by Sir Ian McKellan.So, for the fans of the Fellowship, and for Tolkien's core audience, they may find a few story strands missing from the original novel, but it is highly reccomended viewing anyway, and if those are concerned about not seeing a scene they visioned from the book, keep in mind that probably a year from now will see the release of the Two Towers extended edition on DVD.

		<shortDescription>More great images - more clumsy storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review applies to both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are visually impressive films having wonderful sets, costumes and make-up. The computer-generated effects are generally effective and occasionally wonderful, even awe-inspiring. However both films are boring. The vivid and well-realised images on the screen are not sufficient compensation for the very poor story-telling.Director Peter Jackson can justly take credit for the feat of organising and being responsible for an apparently huge undertaking in getting support for three ambitious, expensive films and then making them on an apparently epic scale. The art direction is wonderful and he has gathered some great teams about him that convincingly bring Tolkien's Middle-Earth to the cinema. Not least, it must be a feat to be entrusted with millions of dollars and keep all those film executives at bay whilst one gets on with the job.That said, the storytelling is inept. Jackson shares the writing credits with two others and they take great liberties with Tolkien's story. This might have been all right if they had made the story better or more suitable for the medium of film, but the changes are not very good and they are badly handled. The screenplay also misses much of the wit and interest of Tolkien's work. It also lacks the drama and tension.Even when considered as a film independent of Tolkien's tale, the story-telling is very poor. This is a director who relies on vivid imagery and hasn't much of an idea as to what makes a decent script. Many of the exchanges between characters are extremely limited; there is nothing deep or profound. Every now and again some of Tolkien's dialogue appears (easy to spot because they're the good bits) but Jackson and Co. appear to have cut and pasted such sections into their script without much care as to whether it comfortably fits into the stuff they have written.Perhaps it is no accident therefore that the film has not attracted true film stars to play the major roles. This is a B-movie cast to go with a B-movie script. That's not to say that some of the actors aren't good: Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Sean Bean give good performances, but one suspects that with a decent script the film series would have been attractive to star actors to take the lead roles. Sometimes the casting of virtually unknown actors can pay off but I'm afraid that they aren't really given much to work on and thus little chance to show what they can do.I don't think that Peter Jackson's direction helps his actors much. This is not a director with a great range, and things such as subtlety lie outside it. Nor do I think he rates the intelligence and comprehension of the audience very highly. Everything is thrust into the viewer's face. Nothing lurks menacingly just out of sight, nothing is merely glimpsed or suspected, no tension is built up: bad things or monsters just appear - "bam!". Slow motion, backlighting (at night and in the wilderness) and extreme close-ups are laid on thickly. The lighting is artificial and the editing is very careless and disjointed.(This is an occasion where the medium of DVD may really be useful. The good thing about DVD is that people will be able to choose the sections they wish to watch and will thus be able to oogle over the wonderful set-pieces as often as they like without having to suffer the tedious parts.)I shouldn't really be bothered going on about all this as it's just a film, but I think that undeserved kudos and plaudits are being heaped on Peter Jackson (not to mention tons of money). What is more, studios will may be further encouraged to think that a decent script is unimportant for a good film.The fact that quite a number of people rave about this film means that the money and effort used to make it were not entirely wasted. (I suspect that they were so impressed by the imagery and the grand theme that they have been able to overlook the films' serious shortcomings.) The sad thing is that a first-rate production was let down by a bad script and clumsy direction. It deserved better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts at a running speed and never stops. From watching Gandalf battle the demonic balrog to the collapse of Isengarde and everything else in between, there is hardly room to catch your breath - and it is wonderful. Add to the surviving fellowship a new and wonderful group of people, the Riders of Rohan, who I have always been fond of - and of course the gnarly old Ents: tree people who are shepherds of the trees, keeping them in order, in their places in the forest. The climax of the film is the huge double battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengarde. I have found it most interesting that in sopite of talk of wizards and Elves, Tolkien's world is not one of magic. Elves seem to possess great longevity, but also an advanced technology implied rather than discussed. And while there is a certain power among wizards, an example of Saurman's "magic" is no more mysterious than the ability to utilize gunpowder, no doubt high tech to Middle Earthers, and mysterious enough to seem magical. (In the books, the Elves explained to Sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them) For me, the battle of helm's Deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action. As usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of Faramir. This was not the Faramir of Tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized. But also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking. The principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess Eowyn, her Uncle King Theoden, her brother Eomer, and the slithery traitor, "Wormtongue". And, of course, the ruined Hobbit known by all as "Gollum". Gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a CGI character, brilliantly "portrayed" by Andy Serkis. Once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again. This extended version is much more Tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy direction - but worth the ticket price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A popular film. Almost 1000 imdb.com comments within the first two weeks. Sellout crowds at the theaters. However, as with the first part of the trilogy, Jackson is clumsy in his direction. The movie drags at times, and comes together in strange, disconnected ways - so unlike Tolkien's novel. It's been said that the film is boring. It's been said this is because Tolkien was boring. No one who has ever tried to read just one page of Lord of The Rings could believe that. Tolkien's casual style insists on telling a story, drawing one instantly into that world, and not calling attention to the novelist writing his novel (or the filmmaker calling attention to the beauty that is New Zealand, rather than the story of Middle Earth). Tolkien isn't to blame. Jackson is. This movie required a great director, with craft and a vision to work with. Had Jackson really paid his dues to direct Lord of the Rings?Editing could help Twin Towers and a few flybys could be scrapped entirely. The film would move faster and flow better. The much maligned Bakshi cartoon of the 1970s, while weak on effects and hired extras, certainly makes the Jackson films seem plodding and leaden, by comparison. Bakshi was on pace to tell the entire Lord of The Rings in under four hours, not nine, had his money held out. The ideal Lord of The Rings movie, in other words, would take the pacing of Bakshi's telling, or more to the point, Tolkien's, the effects of the 21st century and Jackson, etc., and stick more faithfully to the plotlines and story Tolkien developed, as well. Those were well thought out.The flybys suggest something else, as well. A disconnect. The audience isn't shoulder to shoulder with the characters, as in Bakshi's version. We are not running along, or fighting the fights. The audience is watching. The shots are wide shots. It's not an adventure - but an arena. There aren't story arcs, and subplots. There aren't characters, consistent in some ways, and changing in others. There are simply contests, and comic relief between the next show or bout. It's not that much of an exaggeration to compare Jackson's version of Tolkien's classic to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment.Given the rewrite, then, of Tolkien's novel, by Jackson, and the emphasis in a George Lucas world much more on special effects than anything else, how did Jackson do? In my opinion, the Gollum was well done, but somehow cold, and mechanical. I know this has gotten rave reviews. But something was missing that you had in the snippets of Bakshi, by comparison. His Gollum, as a film version, even if a rotoscope, was more engaging. Jackson's approach of Saruman's army was impressive, as was the Battle at Helm's Deep (something Bakshi couldn't hope to rival with what he had). I did miss those magical mortars of Saruman, though. I thought that was what breached the wall in the book. The conclusion of Eomer's ride with Gandolph the White was cut short, I think, considering how much time was spent on the points of the battle beforehand. All of a sudden, it just ended, and Saruman had been defeated. But the charge down the hill was very impressive, as well, even if a whole bunch of the original '10,000' had disappeared (shades of Bakshi).One could argue about Fanghorn, as well. I believe it was called bright, and interesting, in the book. In Jackson's view, it was forever forboding and decrepit. One of the ents seemed geared for the funny papers. But generally I thought the Ents were well done. On the other hand, the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep seemed gratuitous. They didn't change the outcome. The Rohanim still rode to the rescue. There were just a bunch of dead of elves to show in the gloom. I didn't understand the point of any of that. And Tolkien wouldn't have, either. Show the 'fires of Isengard', instead. Spend the scripting, and the money, on that. Jackson is not Tolkien. Jackson didn't write Lord of the Rings. Maybe as something of a hack, by comparison, the man is jealous of Tolkien. But that doesn't change anything.Again, the question is whether Jackson is fit or qualified to direct an epic like Lord of the Rings. I think Bakshi did far better, with a paltry few resources by comparison. Speilberg, perhaps. Others. You don't know. But sticking to the book is probably something new for Hollywood. This is a case where they should have done so, and tried to understand Tolkien rather than impart their own dim sense of things onto a work adapted, at best.Still, for being boring, and a misstep, and an exercise in the pride of someone who thought he was Tolkien, but wasn't, there's still a lot to appreciate in the film. It is certainly worth a matinee price, even at six dollars, or so. It's worth that. On the other hand, the huge Christmas/New Year's sellout crowds, which doubled the gross compared to FotR, might only encourage more of this sort of treatment of the classics, rather than something with today's f/x, but perhaps yesterday's more profoundly human and interesting filmmaking. If only someone could be found to put those two together, and then attempt something like - The Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie; incredibly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lord of the Rings" continues to disappoint. The entire trilogy has never had any real effect on me; when I saw "The Return of the King" in the cinema it was the closest I came to loving the series -- the last hour was really gripping stuff... then the conclusion went overboard and I couldn't wait for it to end.Before I saw "RotK" I thought "The Two Towers" was going to be my favorite from the series -- it's certainly more entertaining than the first film, even if it doesn't contain as nice scenery and cinematography (it's not as lush).My concerns in regards to this trilogy (and specifically "The Two Towers") is that it tries too hard to be an epic, creating far too much overblown, dramatic material that fails to equate into poignancy. Case in point: I'm sure the entire trilogy contains about an hour of footage entirely of Frodo and Sam crying in each other's arms. There's a certain point where too much is simply too much and I grew weary of the constant drama-queen syndrome. Put a female's wig on Frodo and he's a transvestite. I mean, seriously. He cries more than Halle Berry at an awards show.The better parts of "The Two Towers" follow Aragorn's story, but then there's too much exposition: "I ride at dawn to Minis Tirith in search of the mighty plot MacGuffin!" Just do it already! Half the film is wasted because the characters tell us what they're going to do, and then we spend more time watching them do it. Once is enough. Example: "I'm going to kill that monster!" (Aragorn kills the monster.) "I'm going to walk over to that cliff and pretend to jump!" (Aragorn walks over to the cliff and pretends to jump.) Overall I feel this is incredibly overrated because a majority of the voters are those who are duped into buying this as the "epic of our times" when in fact there have been far better so-called "epics" made and more relatable ones, too. I found the human story of "LotR" quite weak and because Peter Jackson spends so much time exaggerating it to such overly-dramatic effect... it leaves a bad aftertaste.It's worth noting the only people I know who love this film are those who infrequently watch films, and/or are under the age of 13. Just for the record.</fullReview>

The fellowship is broken, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) travel to Mordor accompanied by the treacherous Gollum/Sméagol (Andy Serkis). Merry (Dominic Monaghan, now known in TV's Lost) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been kidnapped by the Urukhai, but get rescued by Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies), and they plan their battle with other Ents. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) have joined forces with the King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill). Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), now a White wizard has returned, and with Thoedon's bunch they plan the battle of Helm's Deep against Orcs and Uruks sent from Isegard by traitor White wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Peter Jackson has done another fantastic job, and the big battle is spectacular. Also starring Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Miranda Otto as Eowyn of Rohan, Brad Dourif as Wormtongue, David Wenham as Faramir, Karl Urban as Eomer and Sean Bean as Boromir (flashback). Featuring the song "Gollum's Song" by Emilíana Torrini. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for the Audience, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Cate Blanchett was number 37, and Sir Christopher Lee number 31 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 13, and Sir Ian McKellen number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and McKellen was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actors, the film was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("My precious."), it was number 22 on The Ultimate Film, and as part of the trilogy, all three films were number 11 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.
