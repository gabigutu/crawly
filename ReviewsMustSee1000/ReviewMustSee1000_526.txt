		<shortDescription>How did this film get missed by the Acadmey Awards?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did this film get missed by the Acadmey Awards? This was a delight to watch. Goeffry Rush does such a good job as the inspector that you forget he is an actor and you really begin to dislike him. This film was also perfectly cast, and it has a wonderful music score. I remember thinking to myself as I watched it, that this movie was going to sweep all the Academy awards at the time it came out(but it didn't-infact in was only nominated for one award -Best Music Score(which it lost to "Shakespere in Love").If you will recall "Shakespere in Love" destroyed all the competition at the Awards in 1998. What a SHAME because this film was 10 times better than "Shakespere in Love" in EVERY catagory. This is also one of my favorite films of all time. I own a copy on VHS which I will get out about once every 3 or 4 months and watch the Beautiful story of Jean Vel-Jean all over again. Looking back to 1998 I still AMAZED that Liam Neeson and Jeffry Rush weren't even nominated for thier roles in this film. This is a film that you and your family will love to watch over and over again. It gets 5 out of 5 stars- A perfect Film, A masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, pinch me.....I must be dreaming.This is a Grade A exhibit of how you can still make a terrific movie today without profanity, tons of violence and-or sex.....AND how you can make a picture which carries a good, moral message. This is one of truly rare modern-day films that actually espouses mercy and forgiveness instead of revenge. This is simply a solid film with a very satisfying ending....satisfying to people who aren't in love with edgy, nasty endings.....such as almost all your professional movie critics. So, if your favorite critic didn't give this film a good review - and most did not - please ignore it.In addition to the involving storyline and excellent acting by Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes, the viewer is treated to some beautiful European countryside scenery. My only complaint of this film is the shoddy treatment it received on DVD. No extras and so-so sharpness. Like the movie itself, it deserves more respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An echo of greatness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Hugo's enormous output is unique in French literature... He was described as 'The most powerful mind of the romantic movement' and his novel, published in 1862, continued to be widely read...The plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of Paris... Its author claimed it as a 'religious' work, and indeed by means of its characters, sometimes a little larger than life, yet always vital and engaging, and by its re-creation of the swarming Parisian underworld, the main theme of man's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life...Hugo relives his youth in this vast novel, the culmination of 14 years work... He and Valjean share their most outstanding characteristic: their charitable heart...The story contains glimpses of Hugo's disgust towards 'the treatment of the lower class French citizens by the government: Valjean, an ex-convict recently released from prison, but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself; Fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child...And towards the 'general injustice of the law enforcement system: Valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread; Fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class...The symbol of France's greed that Hugo despises is Thenardier - the man that Fantine entrusts Cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making Cosette his personal slave...The strongest emotions of "Les Misérables are love and hate...Javert and Valjean are both extremes, with a conscience incredibly strict...Liam Neeson is cast as the gentle Valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation... He changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of Vigau, and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent, giving manual and financial help to the weak, sick and poor...After nine years, Valjean was horrified to discover that Javert - a former guard of the Quarries of Toulon, where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of Vigau's police force...Valjean's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire (indirectly) one of his workers Fantine - turned prostitute... He assumes responsibility for raising her daughter Cosette... He becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness...Geoffrey Rush plays the icy chief inspector Javert, the man who tries "to live his life without breaking a single rule." When he is given the job of spying in the barricades and Valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him, things begin to fall apart for him...The action of mercy of Jean Valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence... He is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions... He sees too late the truth...Valjean's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud... He is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in Paris to investigate the mayor, the man he believes is a convict...When he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying Monsieur Le Maire as the 'convict' Jean Valjean, he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed: "You must punish me", he says, "or my life will have been meaningless." (A key line in the film).Uma Thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of Fantine with admirable restraint, giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film... She gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character's frustration and pain exquisitely...Fantine's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child... Being in a wild state, enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery, she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers, but Valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding Javert's authority...When Valjean helps her, she begins to rediscover hope... Her joy at the thought of having Cosette with her is great... But the shock of Valjean's arrest and the discover that Cosette is not there, are too much for the poor creature...Claire Danes plays the teenage Cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful... She disobeys her father's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing Marius - a charismatic young Parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love...Cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the Thenardier's inn, horribly mistreated and constantly terrified... She grew up in a convent, innocent, pure and a bit na?ve...Peter Vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered Valjean around...Bille August tries to capture the essence of Hugo's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance, keeping the eternal three elements: the bishop handing over the candlesticks; Fantine's collapse; Marius crying out: "To the barricades!"History doesn't change, as Voltaire once remarked... But what we need from it, does... Valjean's story is not unique, it's universal... In other world, it's contemporary... There are certainly enough "Les Misérables" to go all around the world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Book, but an extraordinary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love the book, then you won't like the movie. You may notice that other people have noted this film as awful and stupid. All of their judgment is based on the fact that the film is not like the book. However, if you will watch the movie for what it is, NOT what the book is, you may find it is a WONDERFUL movie. The soundtrack is beautiful, the acting is great, and the message is heart-warming. I don't remember seeing such a fine drama in all my life. Not to be biased or discriminating, but if you are of the Christian faith, this movie is 10 times better. It is VERY good, even if it's different from the book. It is one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not true to the story... but entertaining for superb acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not possible to make a movie out of this marathon Victor Hugo novel (the original version I borrowed from library got around thousand pages and I had to settle for an abridged one) without leaving out some good portions. It is only to see what portions are left out and what are stressed. That depends on the director's or screenwriter's judgement. See Dumas' "Count of Monte Cristo" and you'll know what I'm talking about. That movie seemed to be based upon an already abridged version at the first place... such incoherent it was. What audience would appreciate is about making a good film, not following every bits of novel little by little. And that is why "Les Misérables" is a good film. It showed excellently what it showed. What is left out is left out, be it some characters that has no major relation to what the director thought to be the main story or some solitary incidents however interesting they might be.It's got a nice star-studded cast. Geoffrey Rush is magnificent as Inspector Javert. If I am to stress one aspect of his totally excellent acting it would be his accent. I just loved it. Rush brought that vintage English accent instead of the expected French accent, that's I think became more suitable. Liam Neeson is an acting genius and I would place this one perhaps as his third best, behind "Schindler's List" and "Michael Collins" of course. He is definitely the obvious choice for such type of lead roles. The two main young characters of the film are played nicely by Claire Danes and Hans Matheson. Danes acted up to the standard of this film's allover acting level, which is quite good. Although somehow I feel Uma Thurman is a poor choice for Fantine. Her acting was not up to that level.There are around 15-odd screen versions of Les Misérables including TV movies etc. The French production of 1982 by Robert Hossein was good and was definitely longer and more detailed than this. Many would disagree but I think this one by Bille August is better than that. Call it vulgar Hollywoodisation of old classics but still it's a worthy film on its own right, perhaps due to superb casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abridged yet effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first point that bears emphasis about the 1998 film adaptation of Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" is that it is highly abridged. Even more abridged than abridged versions of the novel and even more abridged than the story used for the popular musical. Characters such as Éponine and Gavroche are absent from this adaptation. This will offend those looking for a closer adaptation of Hugo's novel, but it does not bother me that this film focuses on the story of Valjean, Javert, Fantine, Cosette and Marius. The basic story for those unfamiliar with it, takes place in 19th century France and follows a poor thief, Jean Valjean, who is relentlessly pursued by Inspector Javert, even after reforming his ways.Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as the reformed and generous ex-convict and his relentless pursuer. The rest of the performances are commendable as well, particularly from Uma Thurman as Fantine, Claire Danes as Cosette and Hans Matheson as Marius. Claire Danes, in addition to giving a solid performance, seems to fit well with the iconic image of Cosette that has come to represent musical productions of the story.Visually this film is impressive as well with sweeping representations of Paris, Vigo and other locations and appropriate costumes. Basil Poledouris' score was also fitting for the story. The story, though abridged, still effectively gives us the touching tale of the plight of the poor in France, a reformed and ceaselessly generous convict, an overzealous inspector and those around them. I always enjoyed the clash of ideals and cat and mouse game between a reformed criminal and a man who clings to the ideal that no criminal can ever be reformed. This version of "Les Misérables" is recommended for those that are not uncomfortable with heavy abridgements to Hugo's classic novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One could make the snobbish mistake and try to evaluate this movie in comparison to the book, play, or musical. If one were to see the movie as it is, a well acted and directed tale of love, betrayal and passion, then one would NEVER be dissapointed. Liam Neeson IS Jean Valjean, Geoffrey Rush IS the maniacal Javer. Paris IS the city for lovers and broken dreams. This is a movie that sweeps the cobwebs out of your heart and MAKES you feel empathy and warmth for the characters. You want to see them happy and experience some sort of peace in their world. This is a movie that one thinks about for years. A true gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never read the book. I've never seen any other versions. I never knew a thing about, not even how to properly pronounce the title, until I watched this movie. And even then I learnt the pronunciation elsewhere.So I watched this movie expecting nothing but to finally learn what the often mentioned Les Miserables was all about. I have to say I love this movie, oh how I love this movie. The first time I watched it I was on the verge of tears almost from the start. Halfway through I had to stop the video to have a good cry :P for being reminded what a lowly creature I was and how shamefully I've lead my short life. Whoops, am I getting too personal? Sorry.I work at a video store and I've lost count of how many times people have looked at the cover of Les Mis, made a face and turned away. How many times I've sadly shaken my head at that... Oh, how much they miss.With no knowledge of the original story I watched this movie and thought it was absolutely wonderful, beautiful. And after reading the other comments made here I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of the book. It sounds like it's so much better than the movie and my mind reels from the idea of that.Good film. Damn, I would have hated it if it didn't have a happy ending :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good try, but I was disappointed with this version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the play and read the book, and became hooked on "Les Mis" for about a year. So when this movie came out, I was looking forward to seeing it.However, I was disappointed in the changes that was made in this movie.SPOILERS AHEAD.Marius was not the person who motivated the crowd into action. It was Enjolras.Cosette did not meet Marius in a protest, but through Eponine.And Eponine sacrificed herself because of her love of Marius. Where was that in this movie. In fact, where was Eponine--other than as a little girl playing with Azelma? She was an essential character, and she was reduced to a little girl in the background.Also, when Fantine was sick, what was she doing with no pants on?Javert did commit suicide, but it was not in front of Valjean. Besides, if Valjean would have witnessed it, he would have jumped into the water to save Javert--even to the threat to his freedom. In the play, Valjean did save Javert in another situation to the threat of his freedom.And Valjean would NEVER hit Cosette, especially since he's been redeemed and he did take Cosette away from a life of abuse. He loved her. He knew that abusing her was wrong. So he would never have hit her--NO MATTER WHAT!I know that movie adaptations do make changes from the book, and the play didn't exactly follow the book either, but the spirit and characterization of the play still matched the book. Not so in this adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly an Utopia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With no doubt this movie is an utopia. Never ever in my life I have been so mesmerized by a movie in the way this one did to me. This is the movie of my life, a masterpiece, a perfect movie that warms your hearth and changes you as a person if you allow it. In a good manner. This movie also made me read the books. I love this story so much that I will build myself with patience and even go to see the new musical, for which I don't have the high expectations everyone has right now but I'm not going to criticize either. I will go for the story. For the wonderful story of Jean Valijean and Javert. I don't care about the differences. There are always going to be differences, between a movie and a book, but that doesn't matter. The message matters. The message that carries what we all should do more in our life: be a better person than others, be able to forgive and give up hating. This is what really matters and a true "Les miserables" fan will notice and follow that. As for the cast I have no words. Liam Neeson IS Jean Valijean! He's the perfect Jean Valijean that the world will have on screen, no matter what some others say. Geoffrey Rush IS the one and only Javert. He IS and WILL always be the one and only person that could portray the fanatic, perfectionist and twisted Javert. He is the only person by now that could pull all this emotions together and give this perfect performance. If the Academy Awards wouldn't have been so blind at the edition and toss around the Oscars with no sense as they did and would have notice more carefully the wonderful performance of those two the Oscars would have been now at their rightfully owners. But I don't care. For me and for others as well they are the best from that year. Not "Elizabeth", NOT "Shakespeare in love", THIS! Uma Thurman and Claire Danes are the most talented (especially Danes) Fantine and Cosette. Claire Danes will always be Cosette for me. She was the most sweet person in the movie. With the most beautiful eyes as well. The score was perfect especially at the Revolution scene. Very powerful.Watch it people. If you care about good movies watch it as soon as you read this! Otherwise you live in vain.10* PERFECTION!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though there was no singing in the movie-version, This was my favorite. The film followed the Victor Hugo novel quite well with outstanding performances by Uma Thurman (Fantine) and especially Liam Neeson (Jean Valjean) I was moved to tears numerous times as I watched the story of a convicted felon who served serious time for stealing a loaf of bread and later becomes a mayor of a small town. He is suspected of being a former prisoner by the inspector Javert. With the confusion of the French rebellion and Valjean's adopted daughter Cosette's love, Javert realizes that he cannot kill Valjean, a man that saved his life. Javert's decision in the ending is powerful(although I will not give it away) this movie is excellent, and tear-jerking. this is a beautiful classic.</fullReview>

Yes, it IS a long book, and it's hard to adapt such a story to make it fit a 2 hours movie, but whoever chose that the last 1/3 of the book should be skipped altogether was an idiot. I was looking forward to watching this movie, and was very disappointed. The story wasn't touching, the characters weren't either... Jean Valjean was so touching in Hugo's novel. You suffered with him, cried for him, cheered for him and wished he could (finally) enjoy his life, and stop carrying his heavy burden. That's what the story should be about. That's what the movie is not about. Shame.Do yourself a favor : skip this version.Next they'll do a Romeo &amp; Juliet that ends without them dying(!)

		<shortDescription>Most Excellent Movie of Victor Hugo's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This month, I had the opportunity to see the Broadway Traveling Show Musical Production of Les Miserables. Now, while I liked the presentation on stage, there, seated in a sports arena of 50,000 seats of which at least 3,000 were in attendance for a Saturday matinée, I had problems understanding the story. Yes, the stage production was well done. However, I could not see the faces of the actors based on the stadium seating distance from the stage. And, without seeing their faces, it was difficult at times to know which performer was singing and which performer's character was on stage. No, I didn't "know" the whole story even though it has been performed for the last 20 years +.But, this 1998 movie with Liam Nesson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman, and Claire Danes, as principle characters afforded me the continuity of the story, the depth of the character's role because of the movie closeups the actors received. I highly recommend this movie version even if people love the musical. I never had time to read Victor Hugo's mega-volume novel of Les Miserables. So, this film version was so well done that the dramatic acting bypassed the highly touted Broadway Traveling Show.High praise for the actors in this film version. I now truly understand the story and can appreciate the musical stage play better -- even if I couldn't see anyone's faces on the stage.</fullReview>

Yet, I must admit that though I wouldn't have cast them... Thurman was indeed marvelous. Danes didn't put in a performance to write home about, but she did at least an average job. Neeson was superb! I don't think I would go too far if I said that this was indeed his best role ever. He managed to make me feel that he truly was Jean Valjean. He filled me with emotions I have never felt watching a film. I can safely say that this film has literally changed my life. By seeing this movie I now understand the importance of goodness, forgiveness, and most significantly the principle of shunning hate. What a wonderful film! Admittedly, I have never read the book, and now see the error of my ways. Off to the bookstore I go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so there's this film, featuring this famous actor playing the role of a character who may or may not have committed a crime, and he's being pursued [literally for his entire life] by a sadistic persecutor/prosecutor, played by an actor who's his equal in every way. The persecutee changes his names often and is helped by various folks along the way and ultimately faces a quite serious showdown with his persecutor.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in "The Fugitive"....?Nope.Remember, I said this was a film, not a movie.And nary an Andrew Lloyd Webber note to be heard.There is a God, after all. And in this case, it's Ingmar Bergman's old associate, Bille August.This is an excellent film with one of the best casts assembled in recent years. And not a whit of Hollywood hokum to fill the bill.Liam Neeson ["Schindler's List," "Rob Roy," "Michael Collins"] is absolutely brilliant in this adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel/play/story of a man [Neeson] who, as a starving homeless youth, steals a loaf of bread.Rather incredibly [although not unusual in Europe at the time], he's sentenced to 19 years at extremely hard labor, his penance being overseen by the sadistic Geoffrey Rush ["Shine"].Eventually escaping the prison, he embarks on a good life, one with merit. Again and again Shine's character finds him.And each time he escapes. Almost.Uma Thurman's role, as someone mentioned earlier, is far too small.Read the Hugo book... it's a small but pivotal role.Eventually, after several name [and role] changes and the addition of Thurman's character's child to his life, he and the girl ~ now 17 and playd by the gorgeous and extremely talented Claire Dane ~ find themselves in the midst of the early attempts at the initial French Revolution.And Shine, this being 30 years or so later, and his having risen through the ranks, is still in pursuit.See this film.10 0f 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor adaptation, okay film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have been raised on the Broadway production of Les Miserables and just the other day I finished the complete (unabridged) version of Les Miserables. My English teacher observed that I was reading the book and eagerly gave me the film to borrow, saying that it was a fairly strong adaptation. With the thought of a strong movie adaption floating in my mind, I popped in the DVD and was met with a disappointing shock.This film started out with a strong adaptation of the book, but it got progressively weaker. Important characters were eliminated completely (Eponine and Enjolras) taking with them important elements from the book. Eponine, for example, was the key to the complex plot of Les Miserables. She made the situation between Marius and Cosette complex because of her own feelings for Marius. Her character also makes the point that the poor are the essence of a city population, and somehow are easily forgotten. This was point was completely missed in the movie by eliminating Eponine's character (where are the miserable people without her?).Secondly, as many people have said already, Valjean's character and Cosette's became less accurate as the movie wore on. Valjean is a new, honest man. With his new honesty, he has also gained kindness, compassion, and love. Cosette was a blessing which was bestowed on him, and he would never strike his adopted daughter. She's everything to him, and he would never have any reason to harm her. Cosette is not supposed to be a brat. She's the essence of innocence; she does not question her father because of his goodness. Even her love for Marius would not make her disrespect her father.Looking at the movie as a movie, I admired Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush's work in this film. With the so-so material given to them, they were able to do a phenomenal job. They were as loyal to their character as they could be, putting aside the story/character alterations made. Geoffrey Rush was perfect as Javert, with his determination and lack of compassion and mercy. (Although I must say that Javert would never hold anyone at gunpoint as he did in the film - that's against the law and as he says in the film, he is by the book; never done anything out of line in his life.) I just wish that the filmmakers had put more time and effort into a truer adaption of the book. As a film, this is a good movie with strong actors and music, but as a book adaptation, I think it could have done with plenty more work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good first half. After that....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Miserables is my favorite book. When I saw a showing for this I jumped at the chance to watch. The presence of Liam Neeson only sweetened the deal. Yet after the movie ended, I was tearing my hair out in complete frustration. What happened? The movie starts out well enough. It was faithful to the book, and the actors were wonderful. After Valjean and Cosette enter the convent however, the movie just fell apart. It was as if the original screenwriter had been fired halfway through production and replaced by a teenager who'd never read Les Miserables. Marius as the leader of the Amis de l'ABC? Don't make me laugh? Evil kidnapper Javert? Egad. Valjean striking Cosette? Oh my goodness. Even casual fans of Les Miserables will be shocked at the incredibly lame ending, which if you must know, watch the film yourself. Needless to say, it was completely out of character for all involved. The musical was more faithful, and THAT'S saying something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRAVESTY! HERESY! THE WORST MOVIE EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't read this if you don't want crucial plot elements spoiled for you. Ok, anybody who thought this movie was a faithful rendition of one of the best books ever written has obviously not read the book. It was AWFUL! I sat there in the movie theater the whole time just cringing and covering my eyes. Jean Valjean is a good man who has had unfortunate things happen to him in his life. He is reformed by realizing God's plan for him through the kindness of the Bishop. But obviously, whoever wrote the script for this movie didn't care. Things that should never have happened. 1. Fantine and Valjean - no romance ever. The picnic was disgusting. The real Fantine was too busy dying of consumption and working to go traipsing around like that. She remained faithful to the memory of Cossete's father. 2 Valjean hitting the Bishop/slapping Cosette. NEVER! (Although Claire Danes deserved to be slapped...) 3. Where is Eponine? She is who Hugo calls "Les Miserables..." you'd think her character would rate some attention. 4. Where is Enjolras? And why is that dolt Marius leading the insurrection? (Its not the French Revolution, by the way) 5. Why are Marius and Cosette making out? 6. Why does Valjean watch Javert jump off the bridge, handcuffed, gracefully into 2 feet of water? How undignified. The director had NO grasp on the character of Javert at all. 7. Gavroche - he just comes off as a stupid kid who wanders into traffic, instead of a hero of the barracades.I could go on for hours about how much this movie stinks. Read the book if you really want to know about this story, or see the musical. The musical isnt perfect, but at least it conveys the spirit of the novel, and gets most of the characters right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrid misinterpretation of a beautiful novel (Major Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Les Miserables" is one of my favorite stories. It's a beautiful, deep tale of the endless battle between Good and Evil. The novel has been interpreted well on numerous occasions. Several excellent movies were made. And, of course, there's the moving broadway show. Sure, each of these had to cut the very long novel a little and maybe take it's own license. But, in each, one theme remained: Jean Valjean is a *good* man, saved from evil by a kindly bishop, and struggling to remain good in a chaotic world. You're supposed to be touched to the core by Jean Valjean. His struggle and pledge to be good can even cause you to re-examine your own life and values. At the very least, you're supposed to *like* him!Not so in this terrible movie! Anyone who has any understanding of the "Les Miserable" story will tell you that Jean Valjean is not a violent man. He is a truly gentle soul, who was arrested when he became desperate enough to steal a loaf of bread to feed his hungry sister and her children. Why, WHY did this director portray him as violent??? I was angered off the bat when Valjean struck the bishop. But, I thought perhaps this was a comment on how hard prison life had turned him, so I decided to give the movie a chance. But when he slaps Cosette- that was inexcusable. I'm sorry, but that completely demolished any glimmer of hope left for conveying Victor Hugo's message. Valjean would never hit a woman, much less the girl he adores as his own daughter! And now, for the ending. So, Javert handcuffs himself, jumps into a river, and drowns. Valjean witnesses this, does nothing to stop it (!), and walks away happy, surrounded by plenty of Hollywood "freedom" allegory. Again, completely out of character! Javert commits suicide *alone* in the novel. Very important. His entire concept of good and evil, the very notion upon which he's based his whole *life* has been torn away, so he puts his police business in order, then simply and quietly kills himself. ALONE. And, Valjean would *never* stand by and watch this! He'd jump in the river and save Javert. This is the same man who risks his life several times for others throughout the story. After Javert kills himself, the story just ends. Like that. We never find out what becomes of Cosette and Marius. Valjean is free, and we're supposed to be happy with that. But, we're not, because nothing about this movie made us like him in the first place! The film makers may have *read* all 1,000+ pages of the novel, but it was obvious they didn't truly understand it. Go see the movie with Richard Jordan instead. Even better- see the musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times people compare this movie to the book or the Broadway. If you are going to do that, you might as well not even watch it. This movie is a simplified rendition of the book and, besides the setting, characters, and basic plot, is nothing like the book or the Broadway. I recommend that you enjoy this movie for what it is and do not try to compare it to its other versions.This movie is one of the best movies ever made. It has all the best parts of a great movie. Action, love, redemption, suspense, a great music score, a despicable evil villain, a plot twist, sheer emotion, and it give an insight into the past and some of the social problems that existed. If this movie was an original work it probably would have been one of the best of all time, but since it varies from the book, which has a loyal following of its own, it has been overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes a lot for me to shut off a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>half way through, but I made an exception for this one, because I was so angry I was pretty sure I'd have to go down to the local animal shelter and find puppies to kick by the end, and I simply cannot do that to puppies.I understand this is an adaptation and that the source novel was well over 1,000 pages, but there is no excuse to go that far from the source and still try to pass it off as the same story.The book was so full of passion and angst with hope shining through above all, and I could see Hugo in every word. That's totally lost here, and it's clear the motivations for the characters in the novel were entirely misunderstood by the writer, with some characters disappearing entirely. Where's Enroljas? Marius is not Enrojas and should not be depicted as Enroljas. His ever changing ideals and values as he's exposed to more and more in the world make him the character he is.Why is Javert so obsessed with Valjean? It makes sense in the novel; his absolute black and white moral code explains his actions, and his crisis, doing good while breaking the law is what breaks him. Here, he's just really angry stalker man.The point I shut the film off at was when Valjean slapped Cosette, an action he would have likely killed himself before committing in the novel. So I can't say anything about anything that transpired beyond that, but from other reviews I've read it only gets worse.I should have read the reviews before I watched it, and just avoided it entirely, because I'm quite furious with the liberties taken that render a masterpiece into a twisted, mangled, palatable for all piece of standard Hollywood fare.1/10 because I cannot give a zero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very faithful adaptation, but a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we accept that film-makers are allowed to use artistic license to adapt a book or play into a movie, then we must allow them to make changes which they think will make a movie more enjoyable or accessible. If you want purity, you've always got the book. While this cannot compare to the play or the book, by itself, this is a wonderful movie that tells the tale of a policeman Javert (Rush), so egoistic that he cannot allow himself to think that a criminal can be a better person than he is, or that a criminal can get the better of him and escape. Even years on, the hatred has festered until it never escapes his mind, and just the mention of a young girl's name is enough for him to remember everything. While many viewers will no doubt grow to hate Javert, a majority will feel more sorry for him than glad when his end finally comes. I have to say that most of the actors and actresses are perfectly casted and seem to give their all to the movie as they immerse themselves so deeply into the film that it seems less like reel-life than real-life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Les Miserables is my favorite novel, I first read it 5 years ago this month! I LOVE it I have seen a total of 5 movie versions and I have 14 cast albums of the fabulous musical!!! I was therefore very interested in this film. However after seeing it I was left completely sick!!! Especially the ending WORST ending in Les Miserables adaptation history bar NONE!!!I could bab on forever but my friend Chip put it sooo much better:I have written a "tad" about this movie before.. No, no, I promise not to write any more long 3 page tomes on how sick the ending is ... Dicken's "materialistically happy" ending as opposed to Hugo's spiritually profound one. There is no spiritual bedrock to the movie period and without it Valjean does indeed become just another of those Dicken's rags to riches characters, 19th century aging yuppie.Oh dear I did just slip something in didn't I but will stop now without mentioning the silly backflip into a foot of tranquil water, as Valjean just sits back and smiles about it! Cosette as a pistol-packing mama, Marius clocking in and out at the barricade like it's a 9 to 5 job, Fantine breaking off her scene for a happy little bread and cheese picnic in Valjean's backyard (really good for someone with consumption no doubt), the obligatory Hollywood chase substituting wagons for say chariots or just plain horses, the barricade looking as imposing as a speed bump,... oh, gosh and gollies did I "accidentally" add all that? ;)Then I will not comment on Marius the Charismatic Revolutionary ... gag. No, never, would say what I thought of that ... choke!I will definitely stop before mentioning Colm Wilkinson has been saying in interviews, when asked, how he didn't like the movie one bit. Has no complaint with the actors but hates what they did to Hugo -- the story and the characters both. He said, "Didn't like it. I think it trivialized the whole thing. I thought Liam Neeson was good, but thought the movie missed the emotion. It was the real Hollywood tacky approach" ... etc. And this from a man who has read both the Wilbour and Denny translations of Les Miserables and continues to dip into the book constantly.Whoops, did it again. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. ;)Well said Chip!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Les Mis" goes Hollywood with incomplete picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Written by legendary French writer Victor Hugo, "Les Miserables" is well known in modern times more as a night at the theatre. Performed on stage with beautiful songs and magical moments, the story is known throughout the world. In 1998 however, Hollywood writer Rafael Yglesias went back to the original source material to create this film. With good performances by Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush, the film has potential to introduce new people to the story. Sadly however, with the rest of the cast providing mediocre screen presence and with an ironic lack of music, the film feels distinctly lacking.Jean Valjean (Neeson) has been a convict for almost 20 years. On his parole one day, Valjean's soul is bought by a kindly bishop who spares him from a return to prison. Now, breaking his parole, Valjean is constantly on the run as he fights to live his life free from the pursuit of the obsessive Inspector Javert (Rush).From his first ragged appearance on the screen, Liam Neeson fills the shoes of Valjean with minimal effort. Amazingly only nominated for an Oscar once (in 1994 for "Schindler's List"), Neeson is always a solid actor who does justice to his roles. In "Les Miserables" he follows this record with an outstanding performance.In contrast to Neeson's history, Geoffrey Rush has received two nominations and won for a moving performance in 1996's "Shine". Like Neeson, he is an actor you can always rely on to provide, and again like Neeson, he doesn't disappoint here.To have great performances by two great actors should often be enough to make any film, but "Les Miserables" does stand out as possessing a weak supporting cast. Whilst both Uma Thurman and Claire Danes have had good performances through their careers (Thurman in 1994's "Pulp Fiction" and Daines in 2002's "Igby Goes Down"), they might wish to consider removing their roles in this film from their curriculum vitae. Thurman in particular of the two is annoying throughout her screen time and never really clicks as she grates and annoys through to her character's conclusion. Both actresses have great skill and ability, but for so much of this film, that gift appears to have gone missing.In fairness to the supporting cast, it isn't just their acting which makes this film less than it aught to be. The film written, to the best of my knowledge, as a shortened, less detailed equivalent of the book, might be entertaining throughout, but it suffers from a huge lack of soundtrack.Often when creating a film, one of the crucial aspects for it is the music which follows it throughout. When a character is upset, or when something dramatic occurs, music can help to inspire emotion in the audience and help to give the scene a definitive feel. In films like 2000's "Gladiator", certain tunes can be beautifully cast into a scene and can remind you of the film whenever you hear them. For some reason though, with this Hollywood version of a book, often known for it's musical adaptation, there is an ironic lack of sound. In the opening and closing credits, we hear tunes reminiscent of the music of the play, and we hear music which could be beautifully used. Whenever an actor is on the screen however, music is rare to be found. In scenes where characters devote their love for each other, or in scenes of violence, an appropriate overture would be useful. Like the passion they are meant to inspire in the audience however, the music remains missing.Countless people around the world know and love the story of "Les Miserables". A story of passion, compassion, forgiveness and bravery, it is one of French literature's finest works (on a personal note, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is slightly better) and is worth knowing. Made into a musical, it has thrilled audiences for as long as many can remember, and in 1998 there is no doubt that a Hollywood version would be decent. By leaving out so much soundtrack however, and by keeping some woeful acting by a supporting cast, the film is a weak adaptation of a masterful original source.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Les Mis I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Les Mis, having never seen it at the theatre. But when I heard the rave reviews being given for the new, all-singing cinema release starring Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, I really wanted to see it. Seeing the cinema release would be my chance to find out why Les Mis had always been so well-loved. But somehow we didn't get to see this new film and in the meantime my husband rented the non-singing version of Les Mis, starring Liam Nesson, from Lovefilm. I was enthralled. It was fantastic! So well acted. So memorable. Moving. Believable and insightful. Strangely enough, the school where I was temporarily working were also doing a performance of Les Mis - a singing version of course, and I spoke to the stage director and he said to see the school version and you wouldn't need to see the latest film. He was kind of, right. The school's actors and singers were brilliant. Great singing. Great heart. And not having heard the songs in the Liam Neeson film version, it was lovely to say, aha, that's where those songs I've heard people singing on Talent Shows comes from and fits in. Eventually, we rented the Hugh Jackman version and all I can say is, it didn't hold a candle to the Liam Neeson one or even the school-play! Not good singing or acting (except I could feel passion and enthusiasm in Russell Crowe's performance beyond his singing capabilities). But Hugh Jackman? He is not Jean Valjean. Not good acting, singing or stage presence. I could not believe in him as a convict or as a good upright mayor of the town. I watched it through to the end. My husband slept. Now I can justify thinking of Liam Neeson as THE Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as THE Javert. 10 out of 10. Excellent. The best I've seen out of three different renditions. This one is the one I will always remember. See this classic for yourself, if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bille August's Les Miserables is a decent, somewhat faithful adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel set in 1800's France. This movie, hands-down, is acted extremely well and it had great characterization. What I truly missed in this film is the music. Even if it was one or two songs, I would have loved to hear what made the Broadway adaptation of this book a hit.This film is about a convict, Jean Valjean who served 19 years in prison. After his release, he becomes a mayor for this one town. He meets the ailing Fantine and he promises her that he will look after her daughter, Cosette despite being on the run from the persistent Inspector Javert.As I mentioned previously, this film is extremely well-acted. Liam Neeson and especially Geoffrey Rush were respectable in their roles. Rush makes a great villain. Claire Danes makes a very convincing Cosette as well.Overall, this is a pretty good history lesson based off France's rebellion in 1832. This movie has some slow moments, but the great acting takes care if that with no problems. I also wished that there were some songs here. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Valjean vs. Javert, the cat and mouse game of classic French revolutionary proportions - now with Neeson and Rush!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, it doesn't have singing. What Billie August's Les Miserables does have, about the decades long 'chase' between ex-convict Jean Valjean and super-cop Javert,is really strong acting across the board, and what one might call 'handsomely mounted' production style, so it can be gritty, but it almost has the feel of a film from the 40's or 50's, only a little more modern. What I mean to say is I respect this on its own level, not quite like the 2012 film, though they each have their own merits and faults. But especially here, I loved Rush as Javert, a man who is so beholden to the ideal of the law that it buries him, ultimately. I could go on comparing the 2012 and 1998 films, and I want to try to avert it, except to say that I just preferred the story here, how it was told simply, no frills (and no romantic-love triangle just plain romantic interest between Marius and Cosette, the latter being more of a character than in the musical far as I could tell). For people like Valjean and Fantine, they each work their own ways in musical/dramatic film, so on that point it's not totally fair to compare. But I love Neeson as Valjean, and I love Thurman (albeit without a Dream to Dream) as Fatine. And I was blown away by the ending, with the closure coming for both characters within the same locale. While the film may ultimately be TOO handsomely mounted in a way, or maybe the music is not super imaginative here, the story shone through here, and I could see the actors doing so much, under August's direction (and this is a guy who's done Ingmar Bergman so the man knows his character one-on-one drama), to elevate the melodrama into something potent and, for me, true. When Valjean and Javert have their face-offs, across the board they are convincing, tension-filled, but illuminating the moral dilemmas that both characters come across in the course of events. And there's plenty of subtlety to go around too. So, to recommend it would depend: do you want to see a, yes, condensed adaptation of the big-epic Hugo book, with big Hollywood stars and lots of money poured into sets and extras and squalor and... Oh, that's out now in theaters as well? It's a tough call, and you'll have to come to both modern versions both your own way. For me, I'd be interested to see any version of this compelling tale, but at the end of the day, I go for August's professionally drawn, classically shot but deeply felt direction, because, overall, for the medium of film it works.</fullReview>

His combination of frustration and benevolence accurately portray the inner struggle of Jean Valjean.However...this movie left much to be desired, as it failed to live up to the glorious name of Victor Hugo. What this movie gained in the acting of Liam Neeson, it lacked in the depth of plot and intricacy offered by the wondrous author of the novel itself. Furthermore, Cosette's crying was just ugly.Let's straighten up one thing: Fantine and Jean Valjean were NOT in love. Besides, IF Fantine and Jean Valjean were in love, Uma Thurman would not have played Fantine. Liam Neeson would obviously be a "settler" in that relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, other than where it ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is overall good. Liam Neeson is decent, Geoffrey Rush is GREAT,Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Hans Matheson are good. I have seen someother versions of this. Therefore, I know that it ends at an early point. There is something in the ending that is unlike any other version. The ending alwayshappens but there is more afterward that this movie does not show. (spoilers) I guess they did it because one would rather not see the main character's death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that's wrong with this movie, is that the script doesn't have many connections to book. Other than that, I loved it. If it wasn't based on anything, I would call this a masterpiece (In other words, let's say the book never existed. If the writer made up the story himself, it would be better.). On the other hand, most movies based on books do that (ie The Shining). The best thing about the movie was the acting. All the actors were great, but Geoffrey Rush (Javert) was the heart of the film. My five favorite performances by an actor in a movie are Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Picture Show), Jason Isaacs (The Patriot), John Malkovich (In The Line of Fire), Steve Buscemi (Fargo), and Geoffrey Rush (Les Miserables). Those actors' characters are all villains, but they really nailed their parts, which isn't an easy thing to do. Liam Neeson (Jean Valjean) and Claire Danes (Cosette) were excellent. Uma Thurman (Fantine) was good too, but being that Fantine dies so early in the movie, you don't see enough of Uma's talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly disappointed, mildly impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond mentioning that this workmanlike version will surely see many years of duty in junior-high English classes, I have to point out a glaring mistake in the music.The tragic march that plays over the scenes at the barricades was not written by Basil Polidouros (as though one could be unsure), but by Hector Berlioz. Nothing new in using and abusing the classics as mood music, of course, but the choice of this piece is completely muddle-headed. It is the first movement of the Funereal and Triumphal Symphony (Symphonie Funebre et Triomphale, if you want to go shopping), which was commissioned by the French government to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Paris riots of 1830, and thus falls well outside the time of our story.If "temp track" music was needed, there is no shortage of orchestral music from all times and climes that has yet to be drained of its original meaning by being thrust into a movie. But out of all the possibilities why would someone choose from the tiny handful of works that were written about that different, much later set of barricades, also thrown up by angry Parisian youths? Because it's French? I hope the producer hands out thinking caps next time.As for the acting, Neeson does a convincing job as a quiet and troubled Jean, Thurman is far better here than I have seen her elsewhere, Danes irritates more than slightly and Rush is positively magnetic in his coldness.I gave it a 7 (scant).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And yet another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? *Another* version of Les Mis. Yikes. You would think they'd have done it enough by now! This version is OK if you haven't read the book, but it's pretty lame when compared with the musical. Liam Neeson is an excellent Valjean, and Geoffery Rush is pretty good as Javert, just that much makes this film worth watching, but the rest of the cast is not *quite* right somehow. Danes is too snippy as Cosette, not at all the sweet lovestruck Cosette of the novel, and Thurman as Fantine just seemed odd to me. I don't at all like Marius in this film. . . I just can't imagine him leading the insurrection! Where is Enjolras? Marius is no leader! And anyone would wonder, where is Eponine? She was one of the best parts of the story!The barricade is absolutely *pitiful* in this movie. Where was the valor of the rebellion? One would not have any idea what the students were fighting for. . . and even less that they were students! Still, if you've never read the novel or seen the musical (which I'm sorry for you if you haven't done either), you'll probably like this film. It is alright, just as a film, the music is good, and the cinematography is beautiful. But, I would recommend reading the book afterwards!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Play-Movie Comparison? (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I was impressed with the movie. However, they left out some of the parts that I saw in the play, which I saw a day earlier. First of all, they left out the character of Eponine who actually bring Marius and Cosette together. Although when I watched the play I thought Eponine should have gotten Marius, there was no way of feeling that in the film. I thought Cosette should have gotten Marius because he was man enough to talk to her...(instead of like in the play...). Of course if you put in every detail that made the play what it is now, it would have been long, but they could have made it much more interesting.The movie was much more dramatic than the play. The fun of when you first meet the Innkeeper and his wife never happened. There was no fun in this movie it was just...drama... and that wasn't what I expected.Although I didn't expect this, it was still a good movie. Uma Thurman playing Frantine was great. She threw a great pity party. Her character has just been fired from her job (Working for Valjean). Now in order to support her daughter and herself, she reduces herself to selling her body. Although I wish she didn't die, she did, and that was the end of her.I also liked Geoffrey Rush's performance of Javert. In the movie it got to the point where you just hated him, but in the end, for most of us, the hate turned into pity as he let himself drown.Liam Neeson. What can I say? I haven't seen him in another movie but... he was good! Through the movie you feel annoyed by the fact that Rush/Javert continues to chase him and that he can't be left alone. You feel sorry for him because he spent 19 years in prison and now Rush/Javert wants to put him away for life.Now Claire Danes, the movie could have been better for her. If it had been a bit longer perhaps you could have felt more pity for her.Well, this movie immediately went into my list of the top 10 (including Red Corner and The Cutting Edge). If you're ever in the mood for a good movie, rent this one along with a comedy to watch afterwards. I'll give it 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling tapestry of human emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the green landscape of France materialized on the screen, and the sweeping tones of the soundtrack whirled around me, I was swept away into another world. "Les Miserables" was a compelling tale as a novel and a musical, but in this film it is brought to new heights of brilliance. Liam Neeson brings a wonderfully expressive quality to Jean Valjean. His eyes speak volumes. Yet it is the idea of a character that can forgive and find redemption that I find the most compelling. Valjean has been jailed for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. In the novel it is because he attempted to escape, but in the film it is because of the cruelty of the judicial system. This same system allows Fantine to be arrested for defending herself against her attackers when they in fact were perpetrators of the original crime. It allows Valjean to be hunted down like a dog by fanatics like Javert who only want to free their consciences of annoying "problems" like Valjean. Yet ironically, Valjean is the only one who understands the meaning of justice. (Spoiler following!) It is he who allows Javert to escape rather than killing him in the alley. It is he who tells Javert that he does not hate him any longer. It is Valjean who saves Fantine from certain death, because he realizes that jailing her would be wrong. Javert's version of justice is warped by his fanaticism of cleansing the towns of all crime and corruption. Yet at the same time, his ways have corrupted him, and he only furthers them by continuing. (Spoiler!) His final plunge into the Seine River demonstrates the insanity that has pushed him over the edge. He cannot handle the kindness that Valjean has shown him, and cannot forgive himself for allowing Valjean to escape. It is here that forgiveness serves as a two-bladed sword: it can serve to free a person, as it did for Valjean...or trap a person, as it did Javert. His morals did not allow for compromise, and he was beaten before he began. I also enjoyed Claire Danes' performance as Cosette. Here, instead of a quiet, dutiful daughter, we see a girl who has led repressed life because of her overprotective father. When she verbally lashes out at him, asking him who he is, why she should be punished for seeing Marius when she doesn't even know her own father, she brings up a valid point that Valjean must be truthful. We see the other side of the coin: a young child who is socially punished for her father's actions. It is obvious that Valjean adores her completely, but he cannot give her the freedom that she desires-like her father, she is trapped until Javert stops his search. I could go on for hours about this film, but I only ask that you give it a fair chance, because it is an extraordinary work.</fullReview>

Liam Neeson was a very good Jean Valjean. Fantine, though, played by Thurman, was not as pitiable as she ought to have been. Danes was a decent Cosette, but I seem to mostly remember her shrieking at her 'father.' Javert, played by Rush, was excellent. I did not understand exactly why Valjean was running away with a smile-- all right, he's free. But he's not really, which seemed to be one of the many points of the novel. Eh, bien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good film. While it takes some liberties with the plot, it still manages to evoke the sense that the main characters are trying to deal with and be redeemed in a society that they are not a part of ("Les Miserables" can be translated "The Outsiders"). Liam Neeson is incredible as Jean Valjean, and manages to create a memorable performance as a reformed convict in a world that does not acknowledge reform. Geoffrey Rush is perfect Javert, and one truly gets the sense that he does not have a life beyond the law. Uma Thurman presents a convincing picture of a woman forced into prostitution, and Claire Danes, while somewhat overwhelmed at times by the overpowering performances of Neeson and Rush, manages to hold her own as Fantine's daughter. And, Basil Poledouris presents a haunting and entirely fitting soundtrack.In an age where movies tend to be uninspired and geared to the lowest common denominator, this is a breath of fresh air. Definitely deserving of 4.5/5.</fullReview>

In fact, the whole cast was good.But, I must admit, while I thought the movie was technically outstanding and the acting very good, I was left without the emotional involvement I experienced with the book.I'm not sure if continuing the movie to the same ending as the book would have been anti-climatic but it was that very part of the story (Valjean's death after turning a pathetic life into one of true service and compassion) which touched me most.

		<fullReview>I had never seen Les Miserables before, or even heard of anything to do with it before I went to see the movie. When I came out, I got this trembling feeling, you know, the excited kind, where you just smile, and say, "Well, how good was that!?" It is just a sensational story, and even after 200 years it still feels fresh. Naturally I would give this film 5 stars. All the actors were brilliant, and Claire Danes is her usual beautiful self, although at times I felt she pouted a little too much. Neeson should get an Oscar Nomination but won't because this film received pretty average reviews in the media so it's a pity. Rush, is also great, and Thurman's first scene where she explains to her employer about her daughter is a triumph. This is the best movie I saw this year, actually a tie to Good Will Hunting. P.S. - What annoys me most is there was so much talent is this film that went to waste, because nobody went to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never saw the musical production, but did read the novel before in abridged version and it's in English translation as well. Funny that whenever I think about Les Miserables (because normally people have the tendency to link to the musical production, I can understand), I will want to break out into this song being used in the musical - 'Castle On A Cloud'.Because this song was being used once in my past school's music lessons like five years back. We were being taught by our music teacher how to sing it like in the form of Cosette in the musical and we even watched parts of the musical through this tape or something my music teacher has. It was the beginning of me discovering all about Les Miserables and everything in between.Jean Valjean (Liam Nesson) is actually an escaped convict, but then he had managed to work his way through to become a mayor of the town and being popular among its folks. Cosette's mother Fantine (Uma Thurman) was working in the factory that Valjean owned. When it became made known to Fantine herself that she is almost dying, she asked the mayor to find her Cosette and take care of her. But the thing is, young Cosette has already been working for the Thenardiers for some time and the family has always been harsh to her even when Valjean managed to locate Cosette down. Soon Valjean took her under his wing and raised her like his own.Years passed and Cosette (Claire Danes) is 18. By this time, the poor are very unhappy over the French government. A group of university students (they call themselves Friends of the ABC) decided to lead a revolutionary movement. One of them is Marius. Soon, he was being taken by Cosette and always tried to meet her out. But, a revolution is about to happen and his friends needs him and even when a jealous Eponine (she actually happens to be part of the Thenardiers) gets in the way, everything starts to become so uncertain.In the times where the people have no idea what will happen tomorrow during the events of the French Revolution (which did happened in history), it's a little poignant and sad as I watched this movie.I had actually watched the movie once on television here, and another time on cable. Though the ending was kind of what I had never really expected to be (maybe given I had read the English translation of the novel before), at least it gave the uninitiated an idea of Victor Hugo's best known work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This non-musical adaptation is amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Miserables is one of the best musicals of all time, in my opinion, but this movie is not a musical, it is the book version. I have not seen an adaptation without the music, but this is a wonderful drama especially with Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) as the lead actor opposite Inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush). These two were perfect choices for the hatred that is so essential to show in this story. Dare I say that the acting makes me want to actually read the book (gasp)!There is one scene where Cosette (Claire Daines) breaks down and cries before her father tells her the truth about himself, but her reaction is so forced and undeveloped that it is bothersome to have in the continuity of the movie. Fantine (Uma Therman) also annoyed me, but I am not personal fan of Uma Therman, in any movie, so that was most likely the reasoning for my distaste of her character.This is a great movie, without any bad language or overt sex or anything. There is one solicitation for sex given by Fantine to her landlord, but nothing after that. Not even a passionate kiss of any kind. So for an amazing story about forgiveness and redemption from many different people, this is a perfect example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Fugitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those were the days. Steal a loaf of bread to keep from starving and get years of hard labor in the slams. Have an accident at work and lose your job and catch tuberculosis? Become a whore until you become so sick that nobody wants to pay for "a corpse." Except in this case, the poor woman is Uma Thurman. She's thoroughly deglamorized, true, and her bloody mouth is off-putting but still, whatever she's charging isn't enough. She's tall and lissome. Come to think of it, put Uma Thurman together with Mariel Hemingway and Famke Janssen and you've got a complete girl's basketball team.What a splendid adaptation of Hugo's novel, which I barely remember. It's not hard to follow the story but, as in the case of so many 19th-century novels, it's filled with subplots and implausibilities. Somehow -- whether it's in Paris or St. Petersberg -- everybody seems to know everybody else, and they keep bumping into one another under curious circumstances.I see I'm skipping much of the main plot but its basic features are already familiar. Liam Neeson, the convict, breaks his parole, establishes himself as the mayor of a French village. He turns into a good and moral man and he adopts, Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of Uma Thurman. Alas, his latent identity is found out by Geoffrey Rush as Javert, the kind of bitterly devoted police official who follows the rules abjectly, even to his own disadvantage. His is one of the most famous names in literature and for good reason. He is not the personification of evil. He's an ambiguous figure whose own father was a criminal and who wants to see punishment meted out wholesale in an attempt at his own redemption. When he changes his mind, it's a stunning moment. And Rush handles the character flawlessly.In fact, all of the performances are uniformly good and they more than make up for some of the evident weaknesses in the plot. Why, for instance, doesn't Liam Neason level with his adopted daughter and tell her the truth about his background. The daughter is played by Clare Danes, a New Yorker who sounds as if she has perfect pitch for English accents and who has the widest, most curious eyes in the business. But she has to pry Neason's story out of him. And Neasom, sheltering his secret and his adopted daughter, finds himself in the same situation as poor Humbert Humbert, becoming a jealous and demanding authoritarian father trying to control the amorous and otherwise self-indulgent impulses of a resentful adolescent girl.The location shooting was done in the Czech Republic, which has done duty for 19th-century cities like Vienna, Paris, and others. I forget them all. In Prague you can still find thoroughfares with old stately buildings and no McDonalds. The wintry rural scenes are utterly dreary, the result of continental climates that make every exurban landscape look like a vest-pocket park in Linden, New Jersey. What a climate to be poor in.Poverty was a cruel condition in Hugo's time or Dickens' time for that matter. And, as now, many ordinary, good, religious people attributed it entirely to a lack of ambition. It's much easier to think like a psychologist than like a sociologist. We can all understand what "motives" are because we all experience them consciously. It's much more difficult for us to sense the extraordinarily powerful social conditions that affect everyday lives. Think you have free will and can do what you want? Try wearing a toga to school. We never seem to realize how much others are impacted by systemic conditions until the results are self evident. If poverty is due to laziness, about one third of all Americans suddenly became a lot lazier in 1929 than they had been.This is an involving story with fine performances, and you won't regret watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book. Three times no less. So my opinion of this movie may be somewhat biased. I realize things have to be adapted, edited etc, but still...I believe this adaptation to be dreadful. Where do I begin? Oh, yes. The absence of major characters integral to the integrity of the original work, horrible British accents, characters misinterpreted. In short, it was painful for me to watch, being a huge fan of the novel. For starters, Valjean was a man in his 60s by the climax of the story...Liam Neeson in his early 40s with apparently no aging from the beginning of the story to the end. Fantine sold her teeth and hair in the novel. Where the bejeezus do these adaptations conjure up a locket? Is it that hard to make it look like her teeth have been knocked out? Uma Thurman physically makes a wonderful Fantine. She has the look that at one point in time she may have been pretty. I did not care for her portrayal. She is sweet and gentle throughout the movie, and lacks the desperation and neurotisism found in the book. Also I would have liked to see more background information on her, as found amply in the novel. And the attempt to make some sort of love story between Valjean and Fantine was sickening. She is supposed to be a dying prostitute with no hair and no teeth. Valjean cared very much about her in the book, but it was certainly not meant to be of romantic interest. Javert in the novel is stern but sympethetic; "the evil of good" In the movie he is portrayed as somewhat of a lunatic that you want to slap ten minutes into it. The Thenardiers, a MAJOR part of the book, have been reduced to approximatley 5 minutes of the movie. Their children, Eponine and Azelma, also integral parts of the storyline appear to be missing. They managed to get their son, Gavroche in there, but in a minor role with no indication to his parentage. Ugh. I could go on all day, but I've written quite a bit so I'll just breifly cover the rest of the characterizations that piffed me off. Little Cosette was not ugly as she should be, Grown Cosette is not as pretty as she should be. Claire Danes gave the absolute worst performance I've ever seen from an A list star in my life. With her wandering British accent and scary eye whites, she was completely wrong for the role. Marius seemed like a stalker, and the movie put him in charge of the ABC rebellion group, with Enjolras completley missing. (Note to directer- pronounced Ah-bey-sey, not ABC. It was about that point that I really missed Eponine...I'll be the first to admit I love love triangles, and something of interest was really needed then. Anywahoo...there are a thousand other inconsistencies that undermine the original intent of the novel and make for a poor adaptation, thereby making it a poor film. If you want to see an adaptation of Les Miserables, the one they had on Fox Family several years back was actually quite good. This one reeks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...and not in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've thought long and hard about this and I've decided that Rafael Yglesias (who adapted the book into a screenplay) has never actually read the book. I realize, of course, that the book is over 1400 pages long and can't all be crammed into a 2 hour movie, but the parts that are included should be at least minimally accurate. It was frustrating to watch for so many reasons, but the worst of all had to be when Jean Valjean strikes Cosette. I understand that the story needed to be made more "Hollywood" but they shouldn't have changed his character's morals. He loved Cosette more than anything and he pampered her as if she was a duchess. He would never, even in a fit of rage, ever raise a hand against her. I can't fault the actual acting. All the actors are very talented people, but the script itself was flawed. It even seemed like sometimes the story would become too accurate for a while so something completely unnecessary would be changed just for the sake of changing it. For example, in the book, the man that was crushed by the cart was named M. Fauchlevant and the banker's name was M. Lafitte. Why was that changed? And the name of the city was Montreil-sur-mer, not Vigo. Did they just combine Victor Hugo for a simpler name? The number of days Jean Valjean asks for in order to seek out Cosette was even changed from 3 to 2. Completely needless. All in all, I was very disappointed. This movie was clearly a secret government promotion of slapping as every time Jean Valjean or anyone is angered they resort to slapping: the bishop, Cosette, Javert...Blech.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those in love with the musical or the novel will most likely be let down by this film. That being said, it is still not a horrible movie. The main problems lie within the screenplay and plot. The acting itself is quite good. Rush is an absolutely fantastic Javert. He is truly relentless and full of passion regarding his work. Nesson makes a decent Valjean. Most of the faults with the character are a result of a lousy script. Not only do they stray far from Hugo's original work (Valjean hitting Cosette, Marius taking over the position of lead revolutionary, and other things that drastically change the premise), but some of the lines in the film are just terrible.I do feel this is still a film worth watching especially for Rush's Javert. His portrayal of the role is one of the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

I'm still looking for a movie version of Silas Marner that was true to the book.

I haven't finished reading the book yet but I'm getting there. Took me forever to find the fool thing! My history class is also studying the French rebellion of the day. As far as this movie goes, all I can say is that this statement is a matter of opinion. What I think, may not be what you think, so all I can say is rent it and judge for yourself. I didn't enjoy it, but you might. After all one man's trash...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me save you all from a horrible Blockbuster night. I don't know how Hollywood can bungle up a story that was the inspiration to France and now the rest of this world. Victor Hugo didn't write this story to have his work ruined by Hollywood simpletons. The story is notaccurate in the matter that Fantine did not show amourous feelings toward Valjean (played by Uma Thurman and Liam Neeson). Valjean depicted in this movie showed no progress in being a better man as the book clearly explained. Thus, leading us to the third flaw in the remake of Les Miserables. Valjean never, Never, NEVER...laid his hands on Cosette. She was his savior from doing any more wrong. All the director did in this movie was wasting the actors, studio and the publics time. If you own this movie, please take the time to burn it. Also ask yourselves this... How can anybody ruin a story that's already written? For the director... Please don't do anymore remakes, simply write your own scripts and bite the bullet on your own bad stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I belive this movie is one of the most underrated films of the nineties. I must confess that I had not read Hugo's Les Misérables before I saw the film, which may be the reason I liked it so much.The story is excellent and Neeson does a great job in portraying Valjean as the years go by. I could really sense his anxiety, how he had to keep looking over his shoulder all the time. Rush also does a terrific job, but that really is no news. Uma Thurman is great too and, to my surprise, manages to shine even though she has Neeson and Rush as competition. Danes is adequate in her smallish role as is Matheson, but their characters seem quite foundationless and unimportant as the film revolves around the relationship between Valjean and Javert. Maybe the director should have stretched the movie to three hours and used that time to deepen these two characters.All in all, Les Misérables is an excellent story of two exceptional men whose ideologies are very different; Javert is a strict character who does not believe in change or reform whereas Valjean is a petty criminal looking to change his ways and seeking for repentance. It's a powerful, well cast, character-driven drama and it made quite an impression on me.</fullReview>

The screenwriting and the filming are superb, and the actors are the best to be found. So many films that attempt to capture the spirit of the original novels (note I said spirit, not word-for-word text), especially classics, fall flat because they are simply trying too hard. This rendering even had me in tears towards the end, which is certainly not an easy thing to do. Perhaps extreme purists howl in dismay at the slightly altered portrayal of Cosette, but the filmmakers had to choose what to put the most emphasis on without going over three hours. I recommend this film for anyone and everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie, coming into it with high hopes. Little did I know that they would all be dashed. Be it, some performances were pulled off. Neeson, Rush, and Thurman all were great in their roles.The part I have the most problem with is the awful storyline. I have read the unabridged version of the book multiple times and I have the musical memorized, so I know what I am talking about when I am complaining.The largest qualm I have is the lack of characters. The most important and integral of all of them being EPONINE, one of the greatest literary characters of all time, alone with a COMPLETE lack of scenes for both Thénardier and Mme. Thénardier. Probably the worst move in the entire formation of the production was the combining of the characters of Marius and Enjolras. These are two different men who are each others' foils. Marius even debates whether to go with Cosette or to stay with Enjolras, who is always trying to get him down to earth to speak about the revolution, rather than a girl. The difference between the characters was completely lost. These are two men with contrasting personalities. This is another problem: Marius' character in this movie is not really a MAN, he acts more like a sad little boy...sitting out on that fence waiting for Cosette to come to the door. Spoiler Alert The WORST and I mean THE worst part about this adaptation was the ending. Anyone who has read the book or seen the musical knows that of all the characters introduced in the book only four main ones remain alive at the end: Marius, Cosette, Thénardier, and Madame T. I DO NOT see Jean Valjean on that list. He is not supposed to watch Javert drown, first of all, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him after Valjean pleads with him to allow him one more hour to take Marius to hospital. Javert goes, alone, to a bridge above the River Seine (NOT the tiny little backwater creek in the movie) and he committs suicide. Valjean does not know he dies. Second of all, JEAN VALJEAN IS SUPPOSED TO DIE! He is not supposed to walk off at the end of the movie with a new sense of purpose. He is supposed to die and tell Cosette about her real mother before he DIES.Some of the acting was pulled off, but all in all one horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting for this movie is great. I could not think of any actor that is better for the Valjean part than Liam Neeson, nor can I think of better actors for the parts of Fantine or Javert. It is hard for me to believe that with this cast you could end up with such a miserable film.I found the movie rather hard to follow. It seemed that a lot of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor. But that was not the major problem. The major problem was that there was no understanding of Valjean or Javert. They show Javert more interested in catching Valjean than doing his job. To Javert rules are everything. But then the end is just amazing. They have Javert commit suicide in front of Valjean and show Valjean walk away smiling. This completely misses the point of the book. Valjean would have jumped in after him, it is the conflict between Valjean's goodness and Javert's rules that cause Javert to end his life.Maybe they found the book too long, and wrote the screen play from Cliff Notes. If you have read the book, stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as could really be expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Miserables is a huge book with a multitude of exposition and subplots. Quite frankly it's impossible to film in it's entirety. Billie August has made a valiant attempt at stripping the story down to it's core, but in the process has left a film that is too empty and rushed. A film that just needed to take the time to look at it's character's more, but instead was forced to speed on with the next part of the plot.Having said this, it's a film that will still appeal to most fans of period drama's. The production is of a high standard. The actors all give first-rate professional performances. The script is tight and thankfully free of the 'mush' that you expect in Hollywood films. The only people the film won't appeal to as far as I can see, is diehard fans of the novel who can't bare to see their treasured piece of art stripped so bare. This is evidenced by some of the other user comments here.Liam Neeson gives a worthy performance as Valjean. In fact he is probably the best actor in the world right now for this role. It's tough to get involved in any of the other characters in the film though as they are given so little time to develop.Rush's Javert is largely a two-dimensional character, something he could do nothing about. At the final resolution of the character it's hard to feel any emotion for him as we never really knew him. It's good to see Uma Thurman back in a dramatic role, it's where she belongs. She gives a totally consummate performance, but like Rush, she's playing a two-dimensional character. All I can say is give this girl a decent role, she's got great talent.Claire Danes and Hans Matherson as Cossette and Marius have a fleeting romance that is brief even by film standards. It's hard to get any feelings going for them.That's the problem with the film. August fails to get any feeling into it. What should be an emotional journey is merely a pleasent one. As a filmmaking exercise this is quite interesting in proving the pitfalls of adapting epic novels. A classic book does not translate into a classic movie.Rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As stated by many, this movie missed the theme and plot of Hugo's Les Miserables. It left out so many important details that makes Les Miserables the story it is known for. The absence of the Thenardiers was a terrible mistake, they are crucial to understand the character of not only Cosette, but Jean Valjean, Marius, and Javert as well. Eponine and Gavroche are favorites in both the book and the stage production, and although you see "glimpses" of them in the film, they just don't hold the obliged significance. There were major character flaws such as Cosette's extreme naivity and innocence and Marius' incredible stubborness. He is not the leader of the ABC by any means, he was too stuck in his own mind to think.I could go on describing all the peevish things this movie holds, but I won't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed reading Les Miserables by Victor Hugo and consider one of the best novels of all time. I watched this movie with very high hopes -- too high, I found out.The abridgement of this story is necessary, but is entirely too severe in this movie. Large chunks were taken out at will and the meaning of some sections were entirely lost. We only see Marius Pontmercy as some flat lovesick revolutionary; we never see his background nor the stellar importance of his grandfather and father in his life. As a result, I never really 'cared' about Marius. Also of great importance in the novel but who seemed to be entirely missing from the movie (although, strangely, she is credited in the end) is the character of Eponine. Additionally, Jean did some very out-of-character actions in this movie. He knocked out the Bishop, slammed Javert around, and actually slapped Cosette! The Jean as presented in the novel would have NEVER even considered doing those things.As a result, I found this movie boorish, flat, and generally uninteresting. I fear the producers of the film missed the meaning of the book, which was more than the chase of Jean by Javert and the love of Marius and Cosette, it also included Jean Valjean's continued redemption throughout the book and the unrequited love he can finally feel for Marius and Cosette in the final scene of the book. The movie missed out in a big way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one to usually comment on a film after watching it, I rarely do so. But I felt compelled to make a response to all the positive commentary on IMDb regarding Les Miserables.For one thing, the acting was mediocre save for that of Geoffrey Rush and furthermore, the script was blunt and unimaginative.Most importantly, I am sick of hearing people saying that we shouldn't compare a film adaptation to the original text. When a director/producer has utilized a well-known and much-loved epic such as Les Mis, they are already working on the goodwill produced by the original. They cannot conjure a weak excuse of a job then claim that it shouldn't be compared to the original. They could have simply changed the name (as Clueless did to the original 'Emma' by Jane Austen). Directors should not be allowed to get away with hijacking a masterpiece such as Les Mis without the necessary criticism when they do not produce something truthful to the text.I was very disappointed in this movie as not only did it leave out important sections of the text, it was filmed in a manner that made it into a regular Hollywood police-chase-action film rather than the subtle encounters that glued the story together in the text. A narrative similar to that of 'Crash' and 'Magnolia' would have suited Les Mis much better.Overall, utterly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that Victor Hugo was probably turning in his grave when this movie came out. As a lover of the musical AND the novel (yes, I HAVE read it), I think I speak for everyone when I say that this movie has ruined Hugo's classic work. The beginning is actually quite accurate to the book, but afterward, the message is totally twisted. An example of this would be Marius's character: he is pretty much the complete opposite in Hugo's viewpoints. He abhors politics in the novel, and not only is he intrigued by politics in the movie, but he is also willing to die for these views. This role was actually held by another student in the book and musical, Enjolras. A further comment would be that the ending was NOT satisfactory and left one completely clueless... I just can't believe that someone would ruin a great literary work such as this with such a mediocre film. On the upside, Neeson was a well-casted Valjean. I just hope that in the future Les Miserables can be made into a movie that honors it properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen an earlier, more obscure version of "Les Miserables" many years ago, which I thought was very good. THIS particular rendition completely obscured that one. Of course this is a story of redemption. Neeson plays the role of a man who was unjustly (not wrongly, but the punishment should have been for maybe a WEEK!!!) imprisoned for 19 years for stealing food for his family. Such was the way of Europe at that time. Geoffrey Rush was WONDERFUL as the obsessed Javert, intent on putting Valjean back into prison for SOMETHING, though he could not figure out what. The scene at the Bishop's home, soon after Valjean's release from prison, was an ultimate moment, when the Bishop charged Valjean with changing from evil to good. For MYSELF only, I look at this story, along with Dumas's "Count of Monte Cristo", and Cervantes's "Don Quixote" as a few of the best classics in human literature. I can only hope that someone can make another quality film about these others. I rate this one a TEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that people would gush over this movie. It is extremely inaccurate, and cannot even begin to compare to the book, or the musical! It seems that the director just flipped open to a random page in the book and decided to include that part to the movie. At the very least, that would explain how so many major (and I mean really major) things pertaining to the plot were some how missing from the movie. The characters (that miraculously made the tight cut into the movie) were butchered to the point of not being recognizable, and their original, better, and REAL personalities seem to have slipped into the chasm that is the product of Rafael Yglesias being the screenwriter, I suppose. But honestly. I don't understand how someone could do that horrific thing to the book and still sleep soundly at night.</fullReview>

For example Jean Valjean hits inspector Javert (in the book he never hits anybody) and many many other things. A "miserable" movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the point of les mis, for me, and yes, i read the unabridged 1400+ page novel, and have seen the musical, is that cosette is a selfish little spoiled brat. the most complex and interesting characters in both the novel and musical are eponine and javert, and both are flattened, minimalized and obscured in this starparty of a film, in favor or pumping up the much blander characters cosette, valjean, and marius. what was the director of this movie thinking by ignoring the phenomenal characters that already existed? the unrequited love of eponine for marius is the most incredible love story i have ever encountered, and is not even acknowledged by this film. a textbook example of a classic being hollywoodized and destroyed by being committed to film. if we want a happy, no-obstacles love story, we'll watch disney. this was a horrible travesty of what was at one point an incredible story.</fullReview>

And plus it has turned me onto the book.So ... I will read the book ... and I DOUBT I will hate the movie just because it doesn't fit the book to the T... because that is just ridiculous.

		<shortDescription>I read the book first, so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having been disappointed by every single movie based on a book, I decided to rent the movie as opposed to buying it. Boy am I glad I did. This movie obviously cuts a lot of corners, which in the beginning makes sense time-wise, yet it still stays true to the book...until the middle of the movie, where it cuts, butchers and disgraces Hugo's classic. I was appalled after watching this. Everyone involved in making this movie owes a public apology. Don't get me wrong, the acting was top-notch, it's just that the entire story was completely missed, which is unforgivable; no one should have let this movie happen. I'm not kidding. They just made stuff up. This story has no emotional impact whatsoever, except for anger (but that might just be me). If you haven't read the book, you may understand this movie, but I won't guarantee that you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fully agree with bkshortie22, I've seen the movie once for the enjoyment of it, or what I thought would be enjoyment of it...And painfully a couple of more times out of boredom or lack of something better to watch. I identify the most with Eponine, as do a numerous amount of fans/paying customers of the movie/storyline...There are few novels that repeat themselves throughout history...where you can find an example or reference to every aspect of life, that seem to speak to you...and Les Miserables is one of them...However, the love triangle is part of that "everyone can identify with it" captivity of the storyline...And without the hopelessly in love with someone who doesn't love her back, completely true character of Eponine, you lose the meaning...As for Azelma and the locket...In the musical I've grown up on since I was four, Azelma never really has a part/place in the production, she's more of a silent background part, a lot of fans of the musical aren't very aware of her existence...and the locket- In the musical, the other item Fantine sells is in fact her locket...Things are lacking from both the cited interpretations of Victor Hugo's novel, in a way, they're interesting to compare and contrast, but I seriously feel this one was lacking any common sense in the editing department/writing of the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not watch this movie unless you have read the unabridged novel. Although it's understandable that a masterpiece of the length and depth of Hugo's work would be difficult if not impossible to put on the screen, it isn't a good excuse for the movie. If you can't do justice to a great work then refrain from doing an injustice. I consider Hugo's Les Miserables to be divinely inspired if any writing ever was. Read the novel (not the abridged version) and you'll have the benefit of feeling as though you're sitting on Grandpa Hugo's lap while he weaves a story full of passion and ever so artfully presents insight into idealism and reality, religion and ignorance, education and freedom and beauty. You will not get even half of the experience of Hugo's intent by watching the movie. Read the novel, watch the musical, and then take a look at the movie if you can. Like others I walked out of the movie theatre when Valjean slapped Cosette and I think there is no excuse whatsoever for them taking the liberty to change Valjean as they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the HECK can you be a mayor if you can't read or write!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that will actually prompt me to shout at the TV. I was willing to be patient with a Les Mis movie adaptation, because the novel is sooooo lengthy and detailed. But they just completely twist everyone's personalities around. I put up with the characterization errors (the characterization that made the novel so wonderful) but then I turned it off when I saw that they'd made Valjean the mayor when he couldn't read or write. It specifically says in the novel that he learned how to write/read in prison. Again, I wouldn't care, but I don't quite see how any town could flourish under an illiterate mayor. Here is what all bothered me: - I saw people praise this movie because it didn't change Valjean as drastically, i.e. he sometimes becomes violent and hits people. Valjean was NEVER violent. He was freaking put into prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving family. Whenever he attempted to escape, it did not involve violence. Valjean would never, ever, hit anyone--prison made him full of bitterness and hatred, but not violent. - Javert is NOT sadistic. He's certainly not a very likable guy, but his personal experiences gave him a very rigid sense of justice. - Liam Neeson is just too young to play Valjean, I think. They should have aged him up a bit, especially during his stint as Monsieur Madeleine - I also don't think Liam Neeson looked powerful enough. Remember, the man lifted a cart and scaled a wall and bent prison bars. - Fantine and Valjean never had anything between them. She was a little too busy, y'know, dying. - Marius as a political activist is a strange and horrible thought. - Les Mis has many stories inside of it, not just Javert vs. Valjean. - Enjolras is a necessary character - ABC is pronounced "Ah Bay Say," it's a pun - Eponine isn't entirely necessary, but the movie would have been more enjoyable with her - Cosette is not a teenage rebel without a cause who throws a tantrum when she does not get her way - Valjean would sooner hit himself than hit Cosette I could go on, but I won't. It isn't just the novel mistakes. It's just a very boring and stuffy movie. As one reviewer I saw put it: "You keep itching for someone to burst into song." The characters aren't endearing at all in the movie; I didn't fall in love with Valjean like I did in the novel. I didn't cry over Fantine having to sell her hair and teeth and locket. When you can't really like any character in a movie, you have a big problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not possible to watch this film objectively if you've read Hugo's masterpiece. The creators of this flop obviously had no understanding of the characters and barely included many of them at all. Eponine wasn't anywhere to be seen, Thenardier, Gavroche and the priest were only token inclusions and the death of Gavroche doesn't move us at all because we hardly know who he is. Marius is changed from a shy and reclusive young man into the daring leader of the revolution, Cosette to a painful teenager. They couldn't even get Valjean right as they didn't understand that he would never slap Cosette or smash Javert's head into a wall. The portrayal of Javert and Fantine are the only redeeming features of this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Valjean himself this film is good most of the time rather than all the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)is a Frenchman who ends up being imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread. However, Valjean manages to escape from prison and goes on the run. Valjean does his best to set-up a new life for himself and turn his back on his old ways. The film follows Valjean and Javert in a 20 year cat-and-mouse battle and the impact that all of this has on both of their lives.This is my first experience of "Les Miserables" so please bear with me while I try and explain what I felt were the pros and cons of this film;PROS;The cinematography was very good (cold and bleak) which is befitting as this reflects the general outlook for the majority of its citizens. The second thing that was also good were the set designs; clearly a lot of time, thought and effort had been spent on trying to capture the era and it succeeds in making the film look professional and authentic.Some of the performances here were excellent (particularly Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman). Javert initially pursue Valjean out of a sense of duty, but as time progresses it becomes more of an obsession and he slowly begins to lose touch with reality - Rush takes us through this journey impeccably and he's the best person in this film by a country mile. Uma Thurman's performance helps bring out the tragedy within her character; she's a pathetic figure and does some 'questionable' things, but she does these questionable things for all the right reasons so her character is someone who people can identify with. Uma Thurman is someone who is a better actress than people give her credit for and when you look at her performance here compared to films such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill (who are clearly mirror opposites to the character that she portrays here) then it's clear that she is a talented and diverse actress. Both Thurman and Rush definitely up this film a notch.Given the fact that the film in its basic form has something of a 'cat and mouse' narrative to it then it certainly had enough going for it to hold my interest.CONS; The first half of the film is quite engaging, but for me it started to lose impetus in the second half (it neither has the intrigue or suspense that the first half offered and seemed to meander quite a lot). We're once again introduced to an unnecessary romantic subplot which just ground the picture down.In all honesty I also had mixed feelings about our protagonist; on the one hand yes he's tried to turn his back on his former life and he has helped people along the way, but he also lied and deceived a lot of people as well. I suppose the good that he did outweighed the bad, but let's not pretend that he is in any way perfect.I also felt that there were gaps in the narrative that could have been filled; Valjean escapes from prison and then the film skips by a further 9 years by which time he has become mayor of the town. OK what happened in those 9 years? In some ways the gaps and jumps in the film do make it difficult to get to grips with some of the characters and make it hard to care about them at times.Liam Neeson is generally a good actor and I do like a lot of his films, but something just didn't click here when watching him in Les Miserables. When tough-talking or anything physical is required he's excellent, but he seemed to struggle a bit when any sort of emotion is required (maybe I'm biased and maybe the numerous action films I've seen Neeson in have clouded my judgement of him), but I standby my original assertion.Like Valjean himself this film is good most of the time rather than all of the time.</fullReview>

Geoffrey Rush is little more than Javert. he is the Law. the law as expression of instinct of a man who has in it its life sense. the cinematography is great. the soul of the novel is present in each scene. only problem could be the accuracy. the small detail to be more the film of Bill August and not the most loyal adaptation to Victor Hugo. but this sin is, in fact, a virtue. because it gives the chance to transform the original images in a seductive story who preserves the flavor of text. result - a wise interpretation of the masterpiece in new nuances,expression of interesting art who could be compared with other adaptation of Les Mserables.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Objective Critique -- 8 stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers Les Misérables is Victor Hugo's classic tale of nobility and self-sacrifice that will have one questioning what man owes society and what society owes man, especially in terms of justice, and finally, what men owe each other. This film is from 1998 and was directed by Billie August. It stars Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, and Uma Thurman. With source material of this nature one expects a lot and this doesn't disappoint in any way. Les Misérables is a large film that tells a large, decades -long story.Let's just break this film down by the numbers and let the chips fall where they may: A) Plot -- the story of Jean Valjean and his struggle to live free is a timeless classic -- 10 B) Characters -- the Characters are fully realized, well-motivate and very believable -- 10 C) Acting -- Liam Neeson and Uma Thurman give excellent performances and none are lacking -- 8 D) Script -- a very good adaptation which moves the story forward well while providing plenty of detail and background -- 8 E) Direction -- interesting and epic shot selection helped convey the scope of the story -- 8 F) Cinematography -- beautifully and artistically shot -- 9 G) Editing -- conventional editing techniques aided the narrative and cinematography/shot selection -- 8 H) Production Design -- Seemed very much like the period with lots of attention to detail -- 8 I) Costume Design -- Realistic but boring, it might have been preferable to have stylized costumes with a little more to look at -- 6 J) Stunts -- Could have done a little more -- 6 K) Special &amp; Visual Effects -- The armed fighting was too short and featured a lack of intensity that additional special effects could have aided -- 5 L) Music -- sweeping in scope, like the film --8 M) Sound -- strong and clear -- 8 N) Entertainment Value -- 9 Average 7.928, call it an 8. Pop some corn, melt some butter and enjoy.This film features violence from civil unrest with the deaths of many including a child, violence against a woman and adult themes. It is rated PG-13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know what? This is pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of many versions of Victor Hugo's iconic epic, this late 90s version sees Liam Neeson as Jean Valjean, a 19th century convict who is given a chance for redemption, despite the persistence of the law-obsessed Inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush), when he must raise the child of the lowly Fantine (Uma Thurman), Cosette (Claire Danes), amidst various changes and turmoils in France, culminating in the student revolt in Paris.While its ending will have Hugo purists boiling with rage, Bille August's adaptation still manages to be a very fine film in its own right. Its immediate strength is its all star cast's great performances, especially Rush and Neeson in the two central roles, playing off each other perfectly as the kind hearted Valjean and the ruthless Javert. Thurman, following 'Batman &amp; Robin' and 'The Avengers', does make up for it here with a nuanced and kindly performance as Fantine, while Danes' Cosette, though a little more bitchy than other versions, still conveys that sense of goodness and hope that is so central to the character.Production-wise, it's exactly what you'd expect. August' direction is sweeping and large, enhanced by design work and location filming that does make you believe you are looking at early 19th century France, and in the midst of horrid prisons and bloody street battles during the revolution. Veteran master Basil Poleadours' score is also nicely varied, going from booming and romantic, to intimate and sombre as we journey with Valjean as he reclaims his life.Rafeal Yglesias (the same man behind the great screenplay for Peter Weir's 'Fearless') does a workman like job of adapting and condensing the notoriously thick book, mainly focusing on Valjean's journey here and dialing back on a lot of the socio-political commentary of Hugo's work. This is a double edged sword, as it does permit more than a handful of genuinely emotional moments that tug at the heart without being too sappy, and focuses the story more around Valjean and his quest for redemption, but it also means that most of the supporting cast are cut or severely reduced (the Thernadiers are on screen for a few moments, and Marius and Enjorlas get collapsed into one character, among a number of other changes) and again, a lot of the bigger ideas in 'Les Mis' are more in the background. And well, the ending is going to irk purists, which is all I'll say.But despite that, this more base take on 'Les Mis' still worked as an engaging period drama with really tight pacing and a good emotional undercurrent. It may not be definitive, but it is entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Les Miserables (1998): Dir: Bille August / Cast: Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, Hans Matheson: Based on the French classic about life without forgiveness. Liam Neeson plays a convict who escapes custody but upon his attempt to rob an Inn he is surprised when the owner responds, "You were suppose to take the candlesticks too." He served a brutal prison sentence for stealing a loaf of bread. He becomes mayor under a different name and takes pity on a prostitute played by Uma Thurman. Her untimely death puts him in charge of her daughter. As she grows older he finds it difficult to shield her from the outside world especially when she finds romance with a guy leading a revolution. Compelling premise leading to the conclusion that some people cannot find forgiveness. Directed by Bille August who made Pelle the Conqueror. Strong performance by Neeson who lives to right wrongs particularly his own. Geoffrey Rush as a cop who will not accept failure is one note and cardboard with a foolish concluding decision. Thurman is appealing as a prostitute rescued by Neeson's need to prevail goodness but her dismiss is a tad sudden and awkward. Claire Danes as her daughter is effective and predictable, and so is Hans Matheson as her current suitor whom she actually likes. Theme indicates that an act of forgiveness goes a long way.

The 2012 version was so pushed and in your face like damn it cry already. If you have good acting and good direction you don't need that extra push because it can happen naturally. And more than 50% of the singing in the 2012 version sucked. They chose certain Broadway actors but some weren't and their singing hurt my ears. And if you are going to do a musical don't talk during some of the most beautiful singing parts that was just dumb on their part. The acting was so much more powerful in the 1998 version and they didn't have to sing what was on their mind for you to understand what they were going through. I love the Broadway/concert version too but out of the film adaptations 1998 version is far better than the 2012. Oh and the "boy who gets shot" in the story, it really shocked me in the original when the boy got shot by the troops; I gasped, totally saddened. But the boy in the 2012 adaptation... oh my HECK was he annoying - all his singing &amp; mannerisms were just undeniable irritating! Instead I was like "Thank You!" when he was shot.But I talk in full detail about the films compared in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NiJT9mQzokThe 1998 version is the best!

		<shortDescription>A lighter, less dramatic version of Hugo's famous novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen different film versions of this novel plus of course the famous play and read part of the book until I could no more. Sorry but M. Hugo's literature is not for everyone.Now, the original story of Jean Valjean has, as you know, a tragic ending. Poor Valjean dies in sadness because his son-in-law finds he is a convict and execrates him - somewhat exaggerated in my humble opinion for Valjean was notorious for his kindness and loved by his adopted daughter - not your typical criminal.Literally M. Hugo could have granted Valjean a happier ending, which would have been nice for readers, that is considering this has to be among the longest novels ever written. So hundreds of pages of tragic events plus plenty of philosophy -which takes up a whole good deal of the novel- could have perfectly been avoided to provide the reader with a more pleasant reminder. Precisely, what they do in this movie is avoid - literally omit- the tragic finale. Once Valjean is free of Javert's threat, the movie is over and you conclude -or at least assume- that there is a happy ending to a lifelong struggle.Acting is impeccable, Liam Neeson makes a great Valjean and Geofrey Rush's interpretation of Javert is stunning. You feel he's the real deal, an obsessed, cruel man who cannot withstand that his antagonist saved him from death or shame in more than one occasion.No doubts, one of my favorite movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bille August's adaptation of the classic tale of redemption, revenge and romance is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Characters are reduced to bit parts, or are eliminated entirely, whilst the ending is removed. But this does not stop it from being an excellent film. Dramatically shot and convincingly acted, this is one for the ages.The ever reliable Liam Neeson provides the film's soul as the repentant convict Jean Valjean, believable as both a former criminal and a saintly figure, touching with his female costars and smouldering when confronting his nemesis, the ever watchful Javert. The Javert of this film is colder and crueller than the professional of Hugo's book, but in the hands of Geoffrey Rush, he still garners sympathy as his duty -bound world falls apart. Uma Thurman provides pathos in her brief role as Fantine, as does Claire Danes, whose relationship with Valjean provides the true emotional heart of the film. Also notable is Peter Vaughan as the Bishop of Digne, the man who sets Valjean on the path to redemption.So if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, look elsewhere. But if you seek a moving, dramatic and entertaining film, you cant wrong with this version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it were not for this movie, I would have never been familiar with Victor Hugo or the Les Miserables novel. As I have difficulties reading lengthy books, it is wonderful to have such novels adapted into movies. I am aware that this particular movie does not do a proper job in telling the whole story. Apparently, the movie does a poor job in some of the characterizations and leaves out many important scenes. However, if like me, you have never read the book and do not prefer to watch musicals, this movie is quite satisfying. For those who like to watch movies that "transport" you to another period in time, the scenery and costumes do a good job in representing 19th century France. Both Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush do a great job as the main characters. The theme that stands out in Les Miserables is one of redemption- a concept that we all should be more familiar with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Not Live To Its Previous Versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Hugo's stirring novel of redemption and revolution is brought to life by the artistry of director Billie August and his brilliant cast in this film,Les Misérables. Liam Neeson stars as Jean Valjean, a heartless convict who is transformed by a single act of mercy. Uma Thurman is Fantine, the vulnerable prostitute who begs Valjean to raise her only child Cosette,who was portrayed by Claire Danes.Geoffrey Rush is also cast as Inspector Javert,the ambitious policeman determined to return Valjean to prison.This new interpretation of Hugo's epic begins with Valjean, released after 20 years of cruelties and hard labor, reporting for parole in Dijon. Stopping at a bishop's house, he's treated with respect, but even so, he steals silverware, flees, and is captured. However, the bishop says the silverware was a gift, proving Valjean's innocence by giving him two silver candlesticks. Valjean is free, but the bishop asks him to treat others with equal kindness. By 1822, Valjean has risen to mayor of the village of Vigau, where he also maintains a successful factory. Joining the local police, Inspector Javert is suspicious of Valjean's identity and eventually recognizes him as a former convict, but Javert has no proof when he carries his accusations to Paris. Valjean develops a relationship with Fantine, who lost her factory job because of local attitudes about her illegitimate daughter. The starving Fantine turns to prostitution, is arrested and tortured by Javert, and becomes ill. As she dies, Valjean promises to raise her daughter Cosette. Focusing on Valjean's life with Cosette, the story is set amid the action of the 1832 Revolution, a time when Cosette falls in love with a militant student, Marius. On the banks of the Seine, Valjean and Javert have their final confrontation. This version is a beautiful testament to the strength of the human spirit.It contains the moments of high drama, clearly outlines all the motivations, is easy to follow.Unfortunately,it lacks passion as the story is filled with outrage and idealism becomes somehow merely visually stunning.This is a bad film due to the fine cast involved in it and tells a great story. It just doesn't live up to its previous versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1978 version is truer to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this version has great cinematography and good actors and actresses, I felt the 1978 version was truer to the the novel. For example, When Jean Valjean is lifting the cart to free the peasant you would not understand the significance of this act if you had not read the book or seen the 1978 version that points out that this was something that only Jean Valjean could have done and the connection between Javert and Jean that begins while Jean is in prison. At this point of the 1998 version I really felt that the movie was really not filling in enough details and lost interest when I compared it the 1978 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like one of the other reviews I read, I knew nothing of this story prior to seeing this specific movie.I found it to be an incredible drama, with superior acting and the environment was perfectly suited to this story. I did; however, know how to pronounce the title. Funny story behind that, when I was young, I worked at a publishing company and had made a comment to one of the editors there on a framed play poster of this story he had on his wall. Being a very dainty and soft-spoken gentleman, his reaction to my mispronunciation of the title would have made any one laugh; including himself, but he corrected me and after that, I never did forget the French pronunciation of this title.. :)Ever since, I was curious about the story, but as usual, even with classics; I'll sometimes intentionally put them off until later to watch, just for kicks. Sometimes; however, it's easier to appreciate some classics and certain types of books or film until you are a bit older. War and Peace is another novel I'm putting off reading for now. Eventually, I'll find the right time to read that one too.Oddly, I caught this on-demand from our cable company but the trailer somehow got switched with the 1995 version that starred Jean-Paul Belmondo. That movie looked very good as well, although judging from the trailer it must be adapted to a later time than that which the novel is set in.In any event, if you like Drama and have never had the pleasure of being entertained by this story, I would *highly recommend* it. It's certainly a tale of redemption and narrow-minded thinking at the same time. Shows both the side of humanity that we can be proud of, and a side of humanity that would be best left in the past or buried forever, mixed together in a masterful combination of drama.I will look forward to reading the novel as well. This is one of the few benefits from sometimes watching a movie prior to reading the book, I'm sure I will not be disappointed. I am also looking forward to watching other screen plays of this story, hopefully I can find the 1995 version without too much trouble.It may well deviate from the book some, so I can't comment there, but on it's own; it's one of the better dramas I've ever seen. Well worth watching.I went with a 9 out of 10, because I have to agree that the end somewhat just trails off, but I'm not sure if that's how the Novel ends the tale or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Javert creepy; Fantine total excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No songs and dances here; my favorite movies are musicals. No "I Dreamed A Dream". We don't see Cosette's father. Where was this SOB, anyway? Cosette found and living in cruel squalor. Could have been in an orphanage living with Miss Hannigan in "Annie". Javert a total creep; I think Valjean should have told him that his life was being saved because God loves all people. Javert gets his in the end, er, rather gives it to himself. I hope that Marius and Cosette lived happily ever after. The housemaid was very nice, and a good cook. Too bad all the firing squad happened. All performances very realistic. Scenery breathtaking; some country scenes beautiful. City scenes stark and yet elegant. Uma Thurman great as Fantine in all the descent into prostitution and beating and consumption. She really loved Cosette, and I am happy that Valjean gave Fantine's necklace to the older Cosette. Sewer scenes nasty, and I will bet that they smelled pretty horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have an English translation of Les Miserables at home - it is enormous. I have dipped into it here and there, but as it seems to take 100 pages before anything much actually happens in it, I doubt I am going to read it any time soon: I have a mountain of other books ahead of it in my "Waiting to be read" pile.So it is interesting to look at different versions and see what gets abridged in bringing them to the public. This version abridges three things in particular when compared to the musical and the Depardieu/Malkovich version: a) the end - instant happy ending after Javert's demise, b) the Thenardiers, abridged to inconsequentiality, and c) Eponine, abridged out of existence.I have to say that, when you look at this version in isolation, those changes are fine - the story still hangs together perfectly well. Neeson, Rush and Danes are all well cast, Thurman less so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes the essence of the novel and makes it better. The acting is superb, especially Liam Neeson, who although doesn't represent Valjean like in the novel his aggressive performance is what people wanted to see. Maybe it's a more commercial ecranisation of the novel, we can say that, but that doesn't have to diminish it's quality. So if you want to see the boring whole story slow moving action ecranisation go see the Gerard Depardieu movie . But if you want some adventure , go drinking with Liam Neeson, cause he's a true irishman and a true actor and if you think he speaks funny when he's sober try seeing him after he's drunk.The court law scene was brilliant , for that only and it's worth seeing the movie !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous romantic novel of Victor Hugo made us old people to weep a lot over its pages in our youth. Practically everybody read it in those times. It showed the romantic literary patterns of dividing the world black and white between the good and bad guys and girls. Only that the genius of Hugo here changed the conventionally good ones into bad ones and vice versa. The good ones are here Jean Valjean the ex-convict for the crime of stealing a piece of bread to kill his hunger, Fantine the whore that a cruel society pushed into that and the revolutionary Marius fighting against a legal king's regime. The bad ones are the implacable police inspector Javert (who nevertheless turns out good in the end) and several other authorities, guardians and soldiers. The movie is inspired on this story and follows it more or less faithfully, technically well directed by the sure and strong hand of the veteran Bille August and well acted by the cast mainly by Liam Neeson as Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as Javert. The images are good and show well the physical and social atmosphere of the life in France in the first half of 19th century including the scenes of the street fighting that occurred in June 1832 during the funeral of Lamarque, a liberal MP. Particularly moving are the last scenes when Jean Valjean feels free at last after many years of leading a hide and run life. And it's very gratifying to see from time to time a romantic movie with no special effects, computer tricks and gratuitous violence (although I have nothing against these movies when they are good indeed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Song is the heart beat of a Nation. It tells you as to how we are doing as a Nation. I saw the Broadway Touring version of Les Miserables before the movie came out. For me the experience of seeing Les Miserables live was one of the most enchanting events in my life. The musical score specially the "Cosette" and the "Dream" numbers are probably the most beautiful haunting melodies of Broadway. I was not sure how the movie would be without all the musical numbers-but I after I saw the movie-I am even more impressed with Les Miserables. This is just one beautiful period-piece that will remain a Classic whether it won the Oscars or what the Critics think of. When the movie "Bugsy" was released along with "Hook" it didn't fare well in the box office nor the awards even though it was nominated for Ten Oscars. I see a similar analogy here. Here is a movie which is under-appreciated just because it did't win an award. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush give superb rendition followed by Uma Thurman and Clair Dane. With the breathtaking photography and the music score-this movie is for people who appreciate a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i had never read the book, seen the musical, or even heard anything about this story before i watched this movie. i feel fortunate that i was able to enjoy it truly on its own merit, and the incredible storyline and all of its twists and turns were fresh and powerful to me. that being said, i found this movie very entertaining, riveting from start to end, and for the most part extremely well acted (with the possible exceptions of the young star-crossed lovers.) when the ending scene played out, i found myself swept away with the emotion of the scene and mesmerized by liam neeson's reaction. i know people must find it hard to judge this movie on its own, having known the story in its many forms, but as i said, seeing this movie in a virtual vacuum made it one of the best experiences with a movie i've had in some time. a lot of the credit (of course) goes to victor hugo for the amazing tale (however it may have been changed from the book), and the wonderful performances of the two main actors, neeson and geoffrey rush (who was nearly perfect in his role.) bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les MiserablesThis is the classic story of France and written by Hugo. Jean Valjean, played by Liam Neeson is in a quarry for stealing bread. After he met a clergyman, Valjean changed because of clergyman's kindness. Valjean becomes the mayor, and meets Inspector Javert , played by Geoffrey Rush tries to figure out what the mayor is. Valjean grow up a girl named cosset, played by Claire Danes because her mother died. Javert is finally aware of that Valjean is convict and trying to catch him. Now, Valjean and Cosette have to escape from Javert This movie may be termed a tragedy and a heart-breaking movie. The cinematography is great in this movie. Although the original Hugo's novel is fairly long, they did good work for filming it for about two hours. However, this is different from the original Hugo's novel, so the plot is sometimes boring for people know the original. Anyway, I love this movie. I can recommend this movie to anyone as it is touching movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a drama for the ages, but okay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I've just got to get this out in the open - I am an avid fan of the Les Miserables musical and book. But I did go into this movie with an open mind. And for about a half hour I thought it was astounding and touching.Enter Claire Danes. Then it got astounding and awful.I found great performances from Rush, Neeson and Thurman. The latter was especially beautiful. The scene where she shoves snow down a guy's shirt is amazing. The scenes she shares with Valjean are also moving. At that point in the story, we see a lot of character development with Neeson and Rush and their chemistry is electric (I will admit it stays that way throughout the movie). But then it just got really corny and almost unbearably slow. Danes looks like a really rotten actress (maybe she is) and Hans Matheson as Marius is too weird. I remember seeing him in a pitiful remake of 'Doctor Zhivago' and laughing about how ugly he was. Looks aside, he still isn't great in the part. Cosette and Marius are very bland, their relationship doesn't make any sense to me. "I see you, I kiss you, I love you" sort of thing. Five second romance. Unfortunately, it dominates the latter half of the film. Val Jean and Javert kind of get lost. I couldn't make sense of anyone's characters, relationships or motivations. What are we talking about here? What is this movie trying to talk about? A revolution? A rivalry? Where are the themes?Um, they got off the bus after the first half-hour. Sorry.Overall, Les Miserables was disappointing and hard for me to finish. I kept thinking there were better things I could be doing with my time then suffering through two pitifully matched lovebirds cast in front of a backdrop of mashed-together Revolution. I missed Enjorlas as the real leader - I didn't buy Marius as a lover AND a fighter. Harsh ending with no falling action (sorta like Monty Python but that was meant to be corny). Pretty costumes and sets, nothing extraordinary (wasn't Neeson's hair just awful?).Overall...eh...okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge a film by its cover......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a student of literature and a student of film. I am also a writer. As a student of literature I must admit to being disappointed with some films because "they were not like the book". On rare occasions I have been surprised when the film is better than the book ("Ragtime" comes to mind). On the other hand, when a book is a thousand pages long, as a writer I understand one must whittle away from the original and hopefully capture the essence of the original work ? using much less ? for film is brutally insistent on time constraints ? novels are not. You have two hours and not much more.This being said I encourage viewers to approach this film on its own merits and not judge it by the details of the book but by its spirit or essence.The script is tight and focused and still captures Hugo's original drama, pathos, tragedy and hope. The acting, sets, costumes and direction are also equally good. (one amusing but telling attention to detail: horse manure on the streets of Paris. How many cowboy movies have you seen with spotless streets?) Judging strictly as a film you are sure to enjoy it. Judging it as literature you are judging it ? by what it is not.By any standard it is a good film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Usually, I'm not so fond of movies situated in the past, but this one really grabbed me. Maybe that is because I didn't read the book before (I want to read it now! You say it's even better? I want some proof!) Well lets see; GREAT acting, GREAT actors, GREAT story... To me, Geoffrey Rush now seems to be one of the greatest bad guys in film ever. Great acting, again. But this story is really about bad versus good. Its moving to see the best people get the worst, and eventually...(can't tell really, that would be a 'spoiler' right?!) But you gotta watch carefully sometimes, Mr. Bad Guy reveals his true motivation of his hunt in something like a split second ... Try it, even if you don't think it'll be much... I bet you'll discover this to be the little gem you wouldn't have it expected to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the best I have ever experienced. Even though it altered the events of the book it flowed well and did not weaken my respect for it, like many movies that follow good books. The acting is incredible and after watching it you can not help but fall into the spell of Valjean's situation (Liam Neeson) At the end of the movie I wanted to run to tell everyone I knew about how wonderful it was. The movie flows well and although it seems that one bad event leads to another, it doesn't give you that awful unsatisfied feeling, but rather leaves you with a tragically wonderful awe that is almost inexpressible in the English language. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loved The Count of Monte Christo and for everyone loves the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that I have not read the Victor Hugo novel, but plan to soon. I have however, seen the musical live and the 1978 Richard Jordan/Anthony Perkins version. Although I liked much about the 1978 version, I prefer this 1998 version. It is only slightly better acted, but much better as a film in its cinematography, pace, editing, sets, and most importantly its illustration of the contrast between law vs. grace from a Christian standpoint. The two mains (Neeson and Rush) are especially powerful in their roles. I don't mind the romantic interest between Valjean and Fantine, since it makes his relationship to Cossette more understandable and less suspect of other motives, if you will. The major flaw I see in the film is the ending between Javert and Valjean. There is no way it is consistent with the Valjean character to allow Javert to cast himself into the Seine without Valjean jumping in after Javert to save him. That ending really bugs me, I must confess. I have no idea why they had to do it that way, except so that Javert could have his final speech, telling us all why he is what he is and why he must kill himself. He should have waited until Jean was gone before his suicide, knowing that Jean would otherwise rescue him. Otherwise, this is a fine and moving film, all bias aside. It stands alone as a top-notch effort that works on its own merit as a film and a great piece of storytelling. Even the ending can be explained if you see Valjean as simply feeling that enough is enough, and that it is about time Javert ended his own tortured existence. Although I just can't see Valjean giving up hope on anyone after his soul had been bought for God, as it were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loyal to the Basic Storyline but Unforgivably Condensed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the play version of Les Miserables, and being extremely impressed, read an unabridged version of Victor Hugo's novel several years later. I loved Hugo's book and enjoyed every page of it, even descriptions of cities, rooms, sewers, and the Battle of Waterloo, which are all passages that many fans think should have been cut out of the book. Les Miserables is by far my favorite book of all-time.Of course, nearly any film adaptation of a book has to be abridged to allow for a quick running time. However, this film version of Les Miserables goes way too far by cutting out many secondary characters and giving others practically no screen time.The storyline of Les Miserables, for anyone not familiar with it, concerns a convict named Jean Valjean. After being released from prison, Valjean steals from a kind priest and is caught by the authorities. The priest spares Valjean, leading Valjean to reform and dedicate his life to helping others. He soon becomes a generous, benign mayor, but is persuade by an obsessed inspector named Javert.The strongest part of this movie is its casting and acting. Liam Neeson is the perfect choice for Valjean and gives a flawless performance. Geoffrey Rush is equally effective as Inspector Javert. Claire Danes perfectly captures Cosette's innocent character and Uma Thurman acts admirably as Fantine.Despite these strengths, the film cuts out virtually all of the secondary characters. Grantaire, Thenardier's wife, Marius's father, and Marius's grandfather are no where to be seen. Eponine, Thenardier, Enjolras, and Gavroche, all extremely important characters in the novel and even in the play, are given virtually no screen time. Only the characters absolutely essential to the storyline are kept in, and even some of these characters, such as Marius, receive no real development.As mentioned earlier, no film adaptation can keep in everything from the book. However, the play kept in much, much more and still managed to maintain a reasonable running time. This film should have been more ambitious and extended its running time to include more of Hugo's novel. It seems to me that a short film cannot capture the novel effectively; a movie of at least three hours, a series, or a miniseries would be preferable.The film does effectively tell the main storyline without any major flaws. However, the visual style is a little too gloomy and the film score is less than amazing. Still, the film is appropriate for anyone who has never read the novel or seen the play as it will convey the main aspects of the plot efficiently.In some ways, though, I dislike the fact that so many people just see the film without every reading the book or even seeing the play. The movie gives away numerous plot twists and brilliant sequences that would be enjoyed far greater if read in Hugo's book. The same problem occurred to me with Simon Birch, and adaptation of John Irving's incredible "A Prayer for Owen Meany". Like Les Miserables, this film version is well-acted but totally condensed, and it gives away several major plot twists to viewers. The result is that viewers of these movies will never be able to fully enjoy the books on which they were based.Still, this version of Les Miserables is appropriate for people who have never read and never plan on reading Hugo's brilliant novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a visually stunning, superbly acted retelling of the classic Victor Hugo novel of the same name. It tells the story of Jean Valjean, a man who, because he stole a piece of bread for his starving nephew ended up in a hard labor camp for 15 years (five because he stole, and the rest for running). When he is finally given his ticket of leave (parole) he discovers that there are few opportunities for a man on parole. He tears up his ticket of leave and makes a run for it. The rest of the story follows his life over the next twenty-some odd years.It is a story of redemption and forgiveness, pointing out that people can change, and that not everything is black and white. Along the way, we see a broad cross section of society, the good, the bad and the ugly.It is heartbreakingly beautiful, and, truthfully, it can be hard to watch in places.It's also well worth it. The only thing keeping this movie from being a 10 is that it does deviate from Hugo's novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never having read the book, my opinion can only be based on the attributes of the film, not on its reproduction of the book. And the greatest attribute I see in this film is the depiction of the historical moment in France, with all the decadence and poverty characteristic of the period and of the literature of the time.The characters are a bit plain and one dimensional, but it ends up not being a great problem to the plot, since the most important thing here, the main character actually, is fate, a literary obsession of French literature of the 19th century and well transposed to the film. Although the final message is optimistic, the idea of fate and the inability to run from one's past is recurrent in the whole film.I'm sure it doesn't do justice to the book, but it can be a good incentive to someone still willing to read the book.</fullReview>

With the exception of the hints of romance between Valjean and Fantine (hello?) and the excess violence on the part of Javert (striking Fantine), it was a good beginning. Hence I kept watching.However, after this point, I wanted to cry. I swear. Not out of the poignancy of the rest of the film, but the sheer awfulness!! Claire Danes at Cosette was a disaster, and the character of Marius was awful. As an avid fan of the musical and the book, I still believe Philip Quast was the best Javert imaginable, and Michael Maguire the best Enjolras. So I was speechless to see that Enjolras barely existed in this wretched movie, and where the hell was Eponine? Two of my favourite characters (Gavroche and Valjean are the other two) and two of the most important, and they weren't there!! What the h***? And Valjean HITTING Cosette? Oh... my... God.Read the book, by all means, if you can sit through 1400 pages. It's a very good book if you can get through it. But if you want to watch something stirring and exciting and moving and actually faithful to the book in some ways, watch the musical. It's excellent.Do not watch this movie, unless you want to watch just the first half. Don't watch anymore. Ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the characterization of Javert and the actor who played him, I think that was somewhat of an improvement over the somewhat two-dimensional Javert from the musical. But otherwise, it doesn't work half as well as the musical does in getting to the audience's emotions. This is the kind of work where you should laugh and cry and clap at the end and be changed. The movie just doesn't do it.They tried to put too much story into too little time and cut out several important characters in the process. Val Jean is well played, but I think the Marius and Cosette actors were somewhat abysmal. And without Éponine, Enjolras, and the Thénardiers, such a big story feels kind of small.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a note to IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo, staff at IMDb. Uma Thurman played the role of Fantine not Cosette. Hence Claire Dane played Cosette not Fantine. Go do your research and I think you'll find that I'm right. Since I'm here I'll write a review as well. I really enjoyed the film except for Uma Thurman's acting as FANTINE. In the book and stage musical Fantine is such a more personal, heart felt character, who only became a prostitute to save her daughter. However, the movie, as well as Uma's acting, suggest that she did it not just for Cosette, but for the fun. On a better note: Liam Neeson was a PERFECT Jean Valjean which says a lot about Neeson's ability as an actor. Valjean is one of the most well-known figures ever, so there is a certain amount of expectation that goes with playing Valjean. Also, Geoffrey Rush was sensational as Javert. Perfect. Everything the book describes him as Rush was. Perfect. Neeson and Rush made the movie which I gave a vote of 8 to. Although this movie doesn't contain nearly a quarter of content that the book does (which I understand because the unabrigeded novel is 1222 pages) it manages to tell the story of Les Miserables. On the whole, an excellent movie. *Alexander Smith*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay, so if there was a 9.5, i would have chosen that, only due to claire danes (sp?) consistently over-acted pouting. other than that the film is incredibly well acted (esp., valjean and the inspector), the cinematography and color palette is very carefully chosen and carries a lot of emotion w/ it. and what's more, it is one of the most beautiful portraits of grace i have ever seen in a movie. it speaks of the power of God's forgiveness and mercy to transform lives. i was happy to see that this was not left out (as much of spiritual matter is in current Hollywood adaptations of classic works w/ a deep spiritual root). my favorite scene in the movie is the point at which the priest by his radical forgiveness and grace to jean valjean truly does shake of the shackles off his fear and anger towards God, to show him that the Lord truly is more full of mercy than he can imagine. this in turn completely changes his attitude to all other people. a man who really realizes how much is forgiven him cannot help but be merciful to others. of course, hugo himself being a strong catholic, it would've been impossible to tell the story without this central element. anyway, i'm not about to make comparisons between the book and the film (cause i've never read it, though my wife has and found it both at once more interesting in its detail and for that same reason somewhat dull in places.... but any idiot knows that the book version of a story will always be fuller and deeper.... but totally unfilmable. so if you don't like what the movie makers have done w/ it, don't watch movies made off of books, just stay at home and read... it'll save you a few bucks anyway. :) i give this film my highest recommendation.... and take it for what it is, a portrait of the grace of Jesus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but still wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I haven't read the book quite yet (I'm getting to it!), I am a large fan of the musical, so I have a pretty good idea of what the story is "supposed" to be like. And I will say it: this movie makes a ton of errors. Eponine and her family not being in the story enough, Valjean hitting Cosette, Fantine and Valjean in love, Marius leading the rebellion AND sneaking off to visit Cosette. But when watching this movie, take a chance and forget that this movie is based on the book. A strange suggestion, but if you do it, it will be worthwhile.Though the story has many differences from the book/musical/other adaptions, it is still a very good story. The costumes and sets were good. And the performances were brilliant. Liam Neeson may not have been the Valjean we're all used to, but he did a wonderful job and created a very complex character who I really think you can't help but feeling sorry for/liking. I have never seen Geoffery Rush in anything else, and my first impression of him is that he is an AMAZING actor. He was a very good choice for Javert. Uma Thurman was...gosh, she was so incredible. Claire Danes did very well, and she made me like the character Cosette (I really didn't in the musical...when I saw it, I was rooting for Eponine), and even though the Marius wasn't really the one in the musical (um...a cross between Marius and Enjorlas?), I was really impressed with Hans Matheson's performance.It's a different take on Victor Hugo's novel, but it is still an awesome film. You should give it a try before you pass your judgement on it. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**This contains possible spoliers!! Read at your own risk**Script-Victor Hugo is rolling in his grave. If we're talking scenery, acting, or music then I have no problem with the movie, but the script...ugh! I can't even be near the box. They omitted a character considered by many to be the most important. Yes, we're talking Eponine. Oh, and where was our favorite revolutionary leader, Enjolras? I supposed he fell into that little puddle with Javert. Since when does Marius give speeches in the street??? Azelma's there, but what did she ever do? And what gets me the most is this: Didn't Valjean and Fantine seem to be in love?? It was weird. Like during the hospital scene? I wanted to throw up. I would've, too. Who needs ipedac? Just rent this and you're on your way to being sick. For maximum results, read the book first, watch the musical and then rent this!Costumes-The costumes were why I kept watching. Excellent, excellent costuming. If you like crappy movies with beautiful costuming, this is a must have.Casting-I think if they got a toothless old man who only speaks Polish to play Cosette I *might* have liked it. He'd probably be pretty good. Claire Danes...Claire Danes...I used to think she was okay but now I've lost all respect for her. Hans Matheson was good as Marius though, and Gavroche was adorable! I know he got kind of annoying but I have a soft spot for annoying little street urchins ;)I liked the old guy who said one line. He was pretty good.Overall- I hate this movie. I know I seem rather negative, a 'purist' if you will. Sorry if I come off as snobby, but I believe that a movie that's supposed to be an adaptation should actually adapt the movie to do with the book. Okay, I'm done now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie totally blew me away! it was indeed one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. The story is told in such a way that you just have to keep watching.The story is about a convict, named Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson), who is given a chance to change his ways, but inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush) won't let him alone. The story is absolutely great, well of course it is, the book is a classic of world literature. The performances were awesome, most of all Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush. Liam Neeson did an outstanding job as Valjean, he communicates all the emotions of his character in such a way.. hard to explain. Geoffrey Rush was probably the best one in this movie, as the relentless inspector Javert. His performance is so cold, so free of emotions except for hate, anger and desperation, yet so realistic! That was the perfect way to portray Javert. Uma thurman was good as Fantine, not great though, and Claire Dannes was good as Cossete. All the rest of the cast were good too.The music of this movie is amazing, it is so good, it's perfectly adapted to every situation. The direction was excellent too.I would recommend anybody who enjoys a good classic, or a drama, to see this movie. ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not read the book. Therefore, I can only judge the movie by it's own merits. I thought the cast was great. The action was realistic and the acting was not overdone. *Spoilers* Two scenes really stand out in my mind, the first one where Valjean lets Inspector Javert live. Javert made it clear that the chase would not be over, the fact that Valjean let him live showed that Valjean was worthy of "redemption. In a sense, Valjean forfeited his life for Javert. Javert returns the favor in the end when he apprehends Valjean, when Valjean cuts a deal with him for the life of Marius, a young revolutionary who is in love with his adoptive daughter, Cosette. Valjean against forfeits his life for another. In the end, Javert lets Valjean go, puts the shackles upon himself and falls backward into the river. If this action was just about suicide then the shackles would be unnecessary. To me Javert putting on the shackles and allowing Valjean to witness the suicide was a form of redemption. Javert paid the price for Valjean and as a result, Valjean can now go on knowing his debt to society has been paid. Javert goes from anti-hero to hero in this one gesture. Valjean face lights up with the realization of what has happened and is for the first time in his life, is a free man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of anything to do with Les Miserables for approx. 6 years now - I've read the book!! Seen the show. Own about 4 different versions of the film. The soundtracks to this film and many different cast recording's of the show!!!So, I LOVE this film!!BEWARE, THERE ARE SOME PLOT SPOILERS AROUND!!The male leads are superb - Rush's Javert is beautifully portrayed, and he doesn't turn into a panto villain! Neeson is great as Valjean, he can easily convey the emotions that his character goes through, and he goes through a hell of a lot! He is at times both strong and weak - not many actors can project that to an audience!The story should be familiar to everyone, I'm going to concentrate on characters mainly, because that's what the director and the film itself seems to do.This film does stray a LOT from the book, but I won't hold that against it, the film is mainly about the relationship between characters, the most important is the one between Valjean and Javert. These two characters are neither similar or different, it's a very complex relationship. Rush portrays Javert's admiration and sheer hate for Valjean effectively. They have many scene's together and the tension is electrifying!The final confrontation is nothing like it is in the book, and I think the way the film is structured is great! The ending where Javert throws himself into the river Seine is at both heroic and tragic - he is indeed a broken man, with his faith in himself and his God both lost. Notice the symbolism of the handcuffs on Javert!! He has been 'chained' to his quest of finding Valjean for nearly 30 years of his life! It was ultimately, his downfall.It's funny, Les Miz is a VERY religious piece of writing, and the film seems to side-step this issue, which is good in a way, but then again, we don't see how religion effects every characters actions in the film. Valjean especially. In the first 10 mins of the film, the Priest 'saves' Valjean from a life of crime, therefore he is bound to do good. His belief is strongly felt. Much stronger is Javert's belief, for suicide being the ultimate sign to us the audience that he has lost his faith!The women of the film, namely Claire Danes and Uma Thurman, are weak, but somehow still manage to make me cry in their pivotal scenes. Fantine (Thurman) can't shrug off her Yanky accent, and I don't even think she knows what's going on. Danes' performance as Cossette, Fantine's illegitimate daughter who Valjean adopts, is very weak indeed. She is bland and uninspiring.Bille August has managed to arrange a mouth watering cast of mature actors and young talent and it all holds together well, despite it's weaknesses.Tension between the two leads is taken to it's limit, and the love story does actually work. The costumes are beautiful, and the 'epic' scale is worthy of such a piece as this.It's a shame that so much good work in the book is lost on its transfer to film, mind you, we would have a good 4 hour film otherwise. August did well to condense this film into it's 2 hour running time.Give this film a chance, it deserves that much at least, and you never know, you might very well like it!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing version of Victor Hugo's book to musical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is far too refined to hit anywhere near the mark. Thenardier makes a brief appearance and my favorite pair in the musical, Eponine and Enjoris don't exist. The fact that it is a Les Miserables' version is a plus but this movie certainly brings nothing new to the story and infact is a major detraction. The beginning remains intact and rolls on pretty well, I felt that it did perhaps dwell too long on the pre-Cosette half and then when he lives in the monastery and finally moves to 55 Rue Plumet when momentum for the greatest cinematic ending ever begins to build they cut it straight off and all you get is Valjean walking away from witnessing Javert's suicide, another mistake, all that major stuff should happen in the one night, as for killing the students at gunpoint instead of at the barricade, this just falls way short of the mark. Not having read the book I can not compare the movie to that but comparing it to the 16 year old musical one can only feel disappointed. When I first heard that Cosette was played by Clair Danes and Fantine by Uma Therman I avoided it but they have both proved acting skill with this one, the flashy and attractive Romeo + Juliet did nothing to warrant credibility for Danes.The perfect thing to do now that Neeson has been viewed by 1 and a half billion worth of audiences would be to remake this movie and make it a truer adaptation, goodness knows he was right for the part. This can't get more than 7 as a movie and especially not as a literature adaptation. A great shame for one of the greatest stories ever told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the musical Les Misérables, I must admit that any movie version has a pretty high standard to attain if I'd consider it anywhere near to being as good as the musical. Although I don't think any movie could be quite as good as the musical, this version doesn't come close.What bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of depth to the story. Les Misérables, the novel, is about 1100 pages long. It seems that the writers were more interested in keeping the movie at a decent length than keeping integral parts of the story intact. Many important scenes were cut or shortened to the point of them having little or no effect. Many important characters were also written out entirely or reduced to a few scenes. The characters Eponine and Enjolras were sadly missed. Not including Enjolras and having Marius taking over his role at the barricades was one of the worst mistakes the writers made. I honestly don't think that the students at the barricades would have followed Marius into battle, especially considering that Marius often seemed much more concerned with Cosette than his friends. Another horrible mistake was the ending. The ending of Les Misérables (especially in the musical) is one of its strongest parts, yet it was reduced to nothing in the movie.On the up side, the majority of the acting in the movie was very well done, as was the setting.I'd give this movie about 6.5/10. Not bad, but not particularly good either. If you want a truly good Les Misérables video to watch, rent the Les Misérables Tenth Anniversary Concert video. Now that's Les Mis at its best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite film adaptation of Les Miserables yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic Hugo novel has been adaptated in to more films in more languages than you could count, and in the hugely successful musical. Out of all the film adaptations I've seen, the 1998 version is far superior. Yes, "purists" will have a field day with pointing out the changes made from page to screen. "Where's Eponine? Why isn't Enjolras the leader of the students?" etcetera, etcetera, and so forth. Although compared to past film versions (the 1953 version comes to mind... Valjean with a side-kick??) it isn't that bad as far as changing the story goes. If you get past these "changes," it's easy to notice that the heart and soul of "Les Miserables" is intact and magnified. As all period dramas should, it has exceptional costuming and a wonderful score. I was also blown away by the brilliant cinematography. The screenplay is not as wonderful as it could be (considering we are dealing with, in my opinion, the best novel of all-time) but it's certainly very good, especially compared to past versions. What really amazed me in this film was the performances. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush are equally brilliant as Valjean and Javert. Claire Danes, although she does not use the conventional perception of the character Cosette, is great. All of the supporting and "bit parts" are wonderful as well. (Particularly Peter Vaughn as the Bishop.) But the real show-stealer here is Uma Thurman as Fantine. This also happens to be my favourite character, and Thurman hit my perception of the character right-on. The short period of time the character of Fantine takes "center-stage" is certainly the highlight of this film. The scene of "Fantine's Arrest" was worth the price of admission alone. 10 out of 10, certainly one of (if not the) best of 1998 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore What The Book-Praisers Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would be the third adaptation of Hugo's book I have seen: the 1935 version, the musical, and now this. Sorry to entirely break with tradition, but I thought little of the 1935 version; there's no denying it's full of remarkable talent but I just felt it was too faithful to the novel. Ditto, in a way, the musical, despite the fact that it took a number of liberties.Now, here's where I commit heresy - this abridgement of the book is better than *any* other adaptation out there. It also loses a number of the overly pretentious afflictions the book suffers from (notably the death scene). What a number of other people have said is that it doesn't compare to the book. I have read the book, and make no mistake, I consider it to be among the best ever written. But it is too long and suffers from notable flaws - the disappearance of the two major protagonists for excessively long periods of narrative; Thénardier (I won't apologise for that, since his character could be well enough done without - see the musical for proof of his annoyance factor - so kudos to the screenwriter for simply editing him out of most of the movie); and decentralisation. The story is about redemption, yes, but it is also about the relentless pursuit by Javert and the endless flight by Valjean. The book never quite manages to bring together these opposing strands. Most adaptations have unsuccessfully tried to juggle both strands and have failed (occasionally as spectacularly as the book itself does). The film concentrates mainly on the pursuit, and frankly it is all the better for it.The Valjean we see in this film is already a redeemed character by the time we run into him in Vigau. He is incredibly compassionate and quite obviously transformed from our first impressions of him in the scenes at the bishop's house. To all the naysayers - this is why Valjean punches the bishop - to better show his redemption when we jump nine years into the future. It is effective. A single act of kindness has transformed the man - we see that the second we next come into contact with him. But despite his transformation, the violent streak in him still comes to the fore on occasion - witness smashing Javert's head against a wall, and slapping Cosette. The book unconvincingly portrays a man completely altered from his fundamental nature - I'm sorry, but I just don't buy that. Violence is still there, and it can be suppressed, but not always. Sometimes it erupts, given enough provocation. Reasonable enough, I think.Javert is shown as completely uncompromising and certain of his moral stature, but we see towards the end that he wavers. Just as in with Valjean, a single act of mercy changes the man. But, unlike Valjean, he is unable to reconcile that change - it makes a seeming mockery of the way he has lived his entire life. This is effectively portrayed, and having Valjean there to witness it is ultimately what takes this film far away and above all previous adaptations. The scene is cold and sterile without extra human contact. Javert is obviously a cold man, and the presence of Valjean adds some much-needed warmth to the final scene. It gives it extra resonance.And, to everyone out there who loves the book - the faux-spirituality in the death scene is quite simply absurd. It is pretentious and somewhat out of line with the rest of the story. Yes, Valjean is a good Christian man, and he trusts in the Lord. But, an intelligent reader (or, in the case of the movie, viewer) does not need quite so blatant an exhibition of his redemption. As any English teacher will tell you - implication is better than exhibition. Apparently a lesson Hugo did not learn, looking at his other novels.For me, what makes the movie is not the beautiful score, the brilliant adaptation, the lush photography, or even the terrific acting. It is the final scene. It is truly beautiful. Look closely at the entire film and you will notice that Valjean only smiles twice. The first time is with Fantine, and it is only briefly - in this brief expression we see his love for Fantine, something he was unable to ever show her, since in repressing his violent side and dedicating his life to humanitarianism, Valjean had had to some extent disconnect his emotions. He never shows Fantine his true love, and it crushes him - it is worsened by the fact that he brings up her daughter. And, of course, Valjean can never be truly happy because he can never feel truly safe. Every second, on every corner, Javert could be waiting. Valjean can never let go of that fear.[SPOILER!]But, at the end of the film, as Javert throws himself into the river, Valjean looks stunned. But, as he walks along the banks of the Seine, the sheer enormity of what has happened dawns upon him and we see his face slowly break into a great smile. At last he is free, at last he is safe. It is inspiring and breathtaking. This is what the book should have been like. Make no mistake. Beautiful.</fullReview>

However, despite this attempt to bring the majesty of Hugo's book to the silver screen, we are not given the amazing story of a hunted Valjean, a scheming Thenardier, an obsessive Javert, and the love struck couple of Cosette and Marius.While the acting was wonderful, with the exception of Claire Dane's usual pouty hack, the main fault of the movie falls heavily on the script. Let's face it, these brilliant actors can only do so much. The role of Valjean was faulty, especially when he strikes Cosette, something the character presented would never do. Javert, although important and excellently portrayed by Rush, was too important. Fantine, a less-than-major character in the book, was blown out of proportion. Thenardier, as Marius' driving force, was all but absent--what a waste of a wonderful character! Eponine wasn't even in the movie! And Cosette and Marius were unrecognizable.All in all, I thought this movie was a flop. No wonder it didn't do well in the box office. I was left wondering, what was the point of the movie? Surely it wasn't anything more than another hack version of Hugo's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood buffoons butcher ANOTHER classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After embarking on the greatest read of my life and completing the unabridged, 1463 page novel Les Miserables this winter, I was compelled to see this movie. Obviously, it's not going to be as good as the book: it couldn't be. When comparing books to films, I always think of "Lonesome Dove" which was a great film rendition of a magnificent book. This Hollywood crap version of "Les Miserables" doesn't even come close to that.First off, the viewer never knows why Jean Valjean is pursued by Javert. We never see the robbery of Petit Gervais on the road. Javert is simply portrayed as the bad guy and Jean Valjean as the good guy. Javert MALICIOUSLY pursues Jean Valjean, not because he is wanted, but because Javert is just a jerk. Are we really that stupid that the two main characters have to be changed in order for people to appreciate the beauty of this story? Also, the whole story of Cosette is shortened considerably, most likely to give the horrid Clare Danes more screen time as the 'teenage' Cosette. Why leave that early life with the Thernardiers out? We never even got to see Fantine leave her! When taking on the task of putting a book like Les Mis to celluloid, obviously some things will have to be left out. But there are literally HUNDREDS of omissions of poignant plot elements which they ADDED nonsensical fluff to make this movie more appealing to the masses. It's pathetic.The relationship between Marius and Cosette is silly. Jean Valjean smacks Cosette in one scene! Jean Valjean and Cosette live in an extravagantly decorated house all through the movie. They even changed the suicide of Javert to make it more dramatic.One positive note: I loved Liam Neissen as Jean Valjean. I thought he was perfect in the role, though the character was poorly written.With what was obviously a huge production budget, they could have done this wonderful story the justice it deserves. Instead, they pretty much morphed Hugo's novel into a sappy romance 'epic' that fails on all levels.Shameful. 3 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a purist. I see this film as an interesting perspective of the novel. I loved Rafael Yglesias as a novelist while I was in college in the Seventies--it is good to see him as a screenplay writer three decades later. It is his artistic privilege and that of August to make the film with an end that differs from the book. The change does not make Victor Hugo shorter in stature; it only provides a new angle to a great novel.The film has a robust performance by Uma Thurman, rich music and enchanting photography. I have seen several versions of the book on film, but this one stands out for its direction and screenplay. Other versions could boast of richer all round performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about the life of Jean Valjean, or like that, and his life running from Javert, a man that is making his life impossible. At the beginning I didn't understood very well, but while I was watching I liked it more. What makes this movie unique, or kinda of unique, is that they show how people lived in those times, and believe me, they worked so hard. Uma Thurman is a great actress, and the character that she played was of a poor worker that made so many things to pay her daughter's medicine; I felt so sorry for that character, she couldn't saw her daughter never so Valjean take care of her. Honestly, this is a large and good movie, good story, good actors, everything was good for me. Maybe this is the first movie that I don't find errors or things that I don't like. If you consider a person that knows everything about good movies, you must give this movie a ten because is excellent This movie receives 10/10 Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless Hollywood Rewrite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Miserables by Victor Hugo is a complex novel, describing the development of complex people shaping and shaped by history. This movie takes away all of that - the actors portray characters stripped of internal complexity. This gets a 4 because the actors seem to have recited the lines invented by the screenwriter as typed, but they were given lifeless, insincere pap to recite. The actors did a job, but I have more respect for the actors and writers who walked away and did not participate. I am not a "musical" person, but the Cameron Mackintosh musical and the 2012 movie made from it delve deeply into Victor Hugo's complex ideas, while this movie cuts all that away. Gratuitous Hollywood rewrite, fueled by nose candy, sold by star recognition, and filmed in low-cost Eastern Europe still recovering from ideological damage. You can almost smell the bean counters telling Yeglesias what expensive parts to omit. For example, the character of Eponine, the woman who loved Marius so much that she died in support of his love for Cosette, is entirely missing. Eponine's wrenching internal struggle, and the internal struggles of Fantine and Javert and Valjean, could have been portrayed by capable actors like Thurman and Rush and Neeson, but they would have needed months to prepare and many takes to get right. Too expensive.If you want undemanding entertainment that will consume two hours of your empty life without improving it, this movie do the job. Perhaps it will help you get a job doing the same kind of "review stuffing" that made this movie come out at 7.5; when all the IMDb reviews for both sexes all ages come out so statistically uniform, it is either heavily skewed by software robots, or by people paid to act like them. If you dislike musicals, the 1935 movie version, with Charles Laughton as Javert, portrays Victor Hugo's emotional story and character development more accurately. Laughton can say more in with a quivering lip in black and white than a minute of 1998 color film. It will be hard to find - I found this 1998 version in the bargain bin for 50 cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underwhelming as an adaptation, decent on its own though with the first half being much better than the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book is a mammoth and hugely detailed one, so it is inevitable that things would be missed out and that it wouldn't be word for word, Victor Hugo's writing is far too rich for that. Even if the details are missing or changed around the spirit of the source material is welcome(though I try not to be a "purist, I have always believed in judging things on their own merits), something that the second half of this film doesn't really do. It is not an awful film, there are a lot of impressive things but it didn't entirely work and fares the weakest film version of Les Miserables.It is very beautifully shot and the costumes, settings and scenery are authentic(at least it doesn't look too clean) and very easy on the eye, so it is a very well-made film. Basil Poledouris' music score is as stirring and hauntingly beautiful as is characteristic of him and his other scores like Conan the Barbarian and Hunt for Red October. Billie August at least directs with style and pace without being too flashy or dull, though it's the kind that gets the job done admirably but passion-wise rather lukewarm. There are three excellent performances as well.Liam Neeson commands the screen as he always does and gives a real nobility and dignity to Valjean, with an effort in the first half to make him compassionate, the second half doesn't allow for him to go into as much depth as it could and should but Neeson, the great and conscientious actor he is, gives it his all. Geoffrey Rush's Javert is ruthlessly cold and authoritative, yet there is signs of a tortured soul too which stops Javert from being too one-dimensional. On paper, Uma Thurman seemed all wrong, on film she is a deeply moving Fantine(even perfectly fitting the role physically) and of the adaptations her Fantine is one of the better developed ones. Peter Vaughn is appropriately kindly as the Bishop,and young Cosette is adorable. The first half was excellent to me, fidelity to the book is strong, Fantine's plight is very tragic and poignant and Valjean and young Cosette's escape from Javert and to the Convent does have a tension to it.Unfortunately the second half doesn't maintain that promise, the production values, music and Neeson and Rush's performances are still top drawer, but Claire Danes, the characterisation and the ending are off. Claire Danes I found terrible as Cosette, she is both a spoiled brat/rich girl and completely bland(it's like her Juliet from Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet again) and her pouting is annoying. Hans Mattheson fares a little better but not much, he has the looks but he is stiff and tries too hard, also coming across as a rather wimpy leader for the barricade. The ending has no emotional impact whatsoever and is very abrupt, if you have not read the book or seen the musical you will be asking why Javert committed suicide, in fact this is the sort of adaptation that evokes more questions than answers. Most of the lines in the script are true to period and don't resort to cheesiness or awkwardness, but characterisation is very thin here, with perhaps the exception of Fantine and her chemistry with Valjean.You never really see why Javert is pursuing Valjean in the first place and why he continues to do so(those familiar with the source material will do but others won't, did the script-writers think that everybody knows the book or something?). Cosette and Marius' relationship is very shallow and seems to be focused on too much(if Eponine was intact there definitely would have been much more depth), Javert has moments where what he does contradicts what he stands for(especially at the end) and Valjean has moments like at the end and when he's hitting people around where he doesn't seem to have changed or still show signs of being immoral(or better put, finding that goodness doesn't come easy to him) which renders Javert's suicide meaningless somewhat. In the end, because of the lack of depth it is the case of not caring for the characters or not getting to know them. The story is powerful, tense and poignant in the first half but feels underdeveloped and without any true passion in the second half, the barricade just doesn't have the impact.Overall, not a bad film because the first half is strong and those who people would have seen the film for in the first place likewise, but the second half made it a disappointing one. On its own, while under-characterised and with a bad ending, it is relatively decent but adaptation-wise there's much better like the 1934 film. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A turgid hammy mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les Misérables. I guess it would be clichéd to say that that's exactly what we were after sitting through this turgid hammy mess of a movie.Why are French characters being played by American, Australian and Irish actors all talking in rather poor English accents? If you're going to go to the bother of putting on an accent, why not make it a French one? It's one of the mysteries of Les Mis. It's like they've all been badly dubbed. Reminded me of one of those French kids' shows like Belle and Sebastian and The Flashing Blade that used to be on TV on Saturday mornings. Except as a kid watching those I didn't understand the concept of dubbing so just thought these were people whose mouth movements didn't match what they said for some reason. Actually perhaps that's the very effect they were going for with the film. Hmm, interesting choice.And the script reads as though it's been badly translated; the actors seem to have been directed to overact, perhaps with the instruction 'Act as if you are hysterical French people' ? see Uma Thurman's ultimate sickbed scene. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or get particularly involved in their stories, all in all making this an absolutely abysmal version of the Hugo classic.</fullReview>

This is a lot of real "serious" acting taking place (or so the actors would like to think so!). There's also a lot of real serious sounding music.And please, do we need so many ultra-extreme facial closeups of the actors?. Does the director think we are watching this movie on our smartphones?

		<fullReview>This straight down the line translation of the much adapted Victor Hugo epic is just that. It has no flare and even less imagination. Bille August was unable to inspire us with what is definitely an inspirational tale. He certainly did not appear to have the love affair with the story that French director Claude LeLouch showed in his 1995 version.Liam Neeson is solid yet sadly dull as the heroic Jean Valjean. Geoffrey Rush is dramatic and in control, though one feels his Javert is very much by the numbers. Clare Danes is nowhere as the orphan Cosette, and as Marius, Hans Matheson gets little to do. The only standout is an impressive Uma Thurman as the tragic Fontine.Jorgen Persson's lush cinematography captures splendidly the beautiful countryside and historic buildings (actually Prague, Checkoslovakia). Such a shame that Rafael Yglesias' script did not afford Victor Hugo's tome the same treatment.Sunday, December 19, 1998 - Astor Theatre StKilda</fullReview>

For those of you that have never heard of the story and have possibly been living in a hole for 25 years this movie is very good- mainly because you have no clue what other story lines you are missing... What happened to Eponine! and her father's gang??? what about the way they treat young Cosette??? I don't know about you but the actress playing Mademe Theadaire portrayed my mom quite well- She is MEANT to be abusive to Cosette and having used the money Fantine sends to make her own 2 daughters spoiled brats. I totally missed that story line... Having seen the musical a number of times I was very anxious to see a different way that Eponine (the young adult) would have been played... but alas no Eponine! And What about the ending??? The acting by Liam Neesen and Geoffery Rush was wonderful. and came to be the movies saving grace. Claire Danes... sorry i cant see her as anyone but Juliet... especially when she does not change her acting or voice for her different roles. Uma Thurman did a good job as Fantine and i was glad to see her story line grow past what the musical gives us.</fullReview>

It brings forth the 1848 uprising in Paris and in a near tragic coincidental way, brings the inspector back to pursuing Valjean after a 10 year absence.The Paris uprising was never more valiant and the players are true to their form in revolutionary France.

Les misérables tells the story of a man who once stole bread because he was hungry, but they imprisoned him for that 20 years. Later he became a very popular head of a city, but a police officer wants to struggle him, because he believes that the man didn't change, but he did.

		<fullReview>This drab adaptation of the hit broadway show (oh yeah and the book by Vic Hugo) only has the performances of Geoffrey Rush and Liam Neeson to offer, but their performances are impressive.These two, especially Rush, bring to incredible power to the strongly archetypal roles of the obsessive police lieutenant and reformed convict, illuminating the relationship between the two men and making Javert's dramatic suicide (that's the spoiler!) more believable. Neeson's performance is more physical -- he really embodies the wounded but super strong and protective Valjean. I trust him enough to climb on his back and go over the wall into Paris.Unfortunately the directing doesn't strike the right balance between the obsessive plot detail of the book and broadstroke archetypal storytelling we're so familiar with from Broadway and which is such a hallmark of the overall storyline. To top it off, we have to suffer through Claire Dane's lackluster acting and on-again-off-again continental accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the musical Les Misérables, I must admit that any movie version has a pretty high standard to attain if I'd consider it anywhere near to being as good as the musical. Although I don't think any movie could be quite as good as the musical, this version doesn't come close.What bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of depth to the story. Les Misérables, the novel, is about 1100 pages long. It seems that the writers were more interested in keeping the movie at a decent length than keeping integral parts of the story intact. Many important scenes were cut or shortened to the point of them having little or no effect. Many important characters were also written out entirely or reduced to a few scenes. The characters Eponine and Enjolras were sadly missed. Not including Enjolras and having Marius taking over his role at the barricades was one of the worst mistakes the writers made. I honestly don't think that the students at the barricades would have followed Marius into battle, especially considering that Marius often seemed much more concerned with Cosette than his friends. Another horrible mistake was the ending. The ending of Les Misérables (especially in the musical) is one of its strongest parts, yet it was reduced to nothing in the movie.On the up side, the majority of the acting in the movie was very well done, as was the setting.I'd give this movie about 6.5/10. Not bad, but not particularly good either. If you want a truly good Les Misérables video to watch, rent the Les Misérables Tenth Anniversary Concert video. Now that's Les Mis at its best!</fullReview>

There are some things that are simply unbearable, like the fact that every document that may be seen in the film is written in English, while the whole scene takes place in Paris in mid 1800 and the characters are French ! Even more ridiculous is the written "go to ... address" left by Cosette to Marius. Apart from that the worst side of the film is that the psychological profile of the characters and the deepening / insights so important in the Hugo's book are completely forgotten. All that is thought and that could have been put as an outside voice is left for a dialogue that leaves several obscure sides: What is the pain suffered by Jean Valejan when the daughter he grew up becomes aware of her age ? And why avoiding to say that Valjean committed theft, but to steal bread for his family ? I left my last words to the story between Cosette and Marius, that is simply moved forward of at least one century, being unbelievable that the two could behave that way. I must admit that all of the topics I covered were far better shown in the musical that, despite a length similar to the film, succeeded in being pervaded by the Hugo humanity and thought. All in all a score of 4/10 is more than enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Les Miserables shows that film making is as subtle as any art form. The movie has a fine script, good acting (Neeson and Rush do a fine job) and interesting locations. The editing and camera work for the most part are effective. So what's missing?Les Miserables is about people who must do good against terrible obstacles and others who want to destroy them for past wrongs. A classic emotional story like Les Miserables should be grouped with other films like Titanic or Forest Gump. These are "tear jerkers" which also have big emotional themes. To create such feelings in the audience depends on the artistic skill of the film makers and it is often missing here.The film has moments of sacrifice, separation and final triumph which scream for more music, for more emotion and for more tears but the scenes simply die away. While the film could have been more, it is still worth watching for its fine performances and because of this wonderful story by Victory Hugo.</fullReview>

August and Yglesias chose to be blunt rather than poetic, which makes some of it come on too strong, but it avoids the preciousness you find in some period movies. Liam Neeson showed again why he's a good actor with his portrayal of Valjean, avoiding getting mawkish at crucial points, like his scenes with Uma Thurman as Fantine, who was also excellent. In seeing commercials, I thought Geoffrey Rush was overacting as Valvert, but seeing the whole movie, I thought he was excellent and true to character the whole way. However, Claire Danes was miscast as Cosette; she's too modern. I also didn't care for the actor who played Marius, so those scenes with him and Cosette slowed the movie down.

		<shortDescription>Neeson and Rush are excellent. Everyone else isn't so hot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very strong, solid acting on the part of Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush. Their performances as the lead characters of Valjean and Javert certainly did justice to the book, and I was captivated during every scene the two of them shared. The atmosphere was excellent, and I was impressed with the way the story's ending was adapted and directed. My only major problem with the movie was the cast of supporting characters. Claire Danes delivered her usual pouty, angstful teen performance. And Uma Thurman was surprisingly forgettable, even when she was at the center of the action. All together, the movie had more strong points than weak points. If you didn't read or didn't like Les Miserables in high school, you'll probably find this movie entertaining and accessible. But if you're watching the film in hopes of seeing a castful of Victor Hugo's fleshy and complex characters, you'll probably be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each year, during Christmas vacation, they broadcast a cartoon based on Victor Hugo's novel and I watch it. I cry each time. So, I was expecting a lot of this movie and I was a little deceived. Even if the story is well respected, there's a lack of emotion in it. It didn't trouble my sensible heart and I didn't drop a tear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay movie, claire danes seems to be overacted in a few scenes though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Especially when she finds out that her so called father isn't who he says he is. Not to divulge more to the plot I'll leave it there. (for the few who havn't seen any versions)Though I liked the movie, I'd only give this about 4 out of 10 stars. There is another version 1957 version I thought told the story better. As compared to that, the 1998 version cut off the end of the movie so we are left hanging at the end. The actor playing Javert (the inspector) must be commended though. It was as if he's always played that roll. I thought the ending Climax with him going to the water was excellent. The quickness of the stunt from the handcuffs was fun. The best part I liked of course is probably the music. That is something the 1957 version lacks. But then again, the 1957 version w/o most of the music, makes for a subtle viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Contains spoilers. This movie isn't horrible. It's actually a fairly good movie, presuming you've never seen/heard the musical, novel, or summary of either. The story strays from the beauty of the Hugo's novel. While we are shown the complexity of Valjean and Javert's inner battles as well as external, vital characters are cut from the story, as are full story lines. For example, one of the major story lines of the novel and musical is a love triangle between Marius, Cosette, and another Thenardier daughter, Eponine (who's cut from the movie entirely). Eponine's unrequited love for Marius gives a bittersweet soul to Cosette and Marius and she is the one who gets them together. Also, I hate to break this to you, but Marius is NOT the leader of the ABC group (the revolutionary boys). The novel gives that title to Courfeyrac, and the musical to Enjolras (a sort of co-commander in the novel). The deaths of the revolutionary boys are much different and more heart-wrenching in the book. Also, the movie ends about 3/4 of the way through the book. If a movie version was done properly, with all characters and story lines, I have no doubt it would be a blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly unforgettable drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually gush about a movie about I was absolutely mesmerized by this film. I should mention this is my first exposure to the story. I haven't read Victor Hugo's novel or seen any of the other film or stage versions of it. Liam Neeson is simply captivating as Valjean as is Geoffrey Rush as his nemesis Inspector Javert. Claire Danes is also excellent as the adult Cosette but in my opinion the actor who shines the brightest in this film is Uma Thurman's Fantine. The direction of Bille August and his team recreates an absolutely convincing France circa 1800 in Prague. I will never forget this truly moving story about justice, class, devotion, perseverance and obsession. Strongly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful, interesting version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went along to this with a number of versions of Hugo's book already in my mind - the 1935 March/Laughton version for one, the terrible 1978 Jordan/Perkins one for another, and of course the brilliant Boublil/Schoenberg musical. What else could be added? How would they approach it this time? Some reviews said it was a dull and dark adaptation but I disagree. It is a fabulous version - it opens out whole new angles on the characters of Valjean and Javert, it provides Fantine with a chance to really gain the pity and support of the audience, it shows the students' revolution as the hopeless and pathetic uprising it was. This is a brilliant film. Marius and Cosette come across as naive children not at home in the sinister and twisted Paris they have found themselves in - indeed, it is Cosette's naivete and stupidity which puts Valjean in danger of discovery on more than one occasion. I particularly liked the way the ending was done - interesting. Immensely enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Bille August, or whoever wrote the script for this movie, has missed the point if Victor Hugo's book. In my opinion, what makes the story so great is the portraits of the people, and that is why it is called "Les Misérables" ("The miserable people" or something like that). This script only focuses on the story of Valjean and Javert, and all of the other charachters are forgotten, some are not even in the movie since they don't help to bring the Valjean/Javert story further.One of the problems with this movie is that it is too short. You can't fit the whole book into two hours unless you skip a few parts, but this movie is so shortened that I don't see why it's been made at all.I would recommend anyone who is interested in this story to see the french mini-series from 2000, with Gerard Depardieu in the role of Jean Valjean (I like Liam Neeson, but that part was *made* for Depardieu), instead. It's long, but well made and very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Les Miserables being my favorite novel ever, and considering the cast, I was eagerly looking forward to this version. Unfortunately, something went very, very wrong. Someone who has never read the book might be able to enjoy this movie, but I certainly couldn't. I know it must be difficult to transform a thousand pages of text into a merely 159 minute movie - in fact, I'm beginning to suspect it might be impossible after seeing this. Given their limited time, they might have devoted more of it to telling the rest of the story and less to using bland cinematic devices to make us feel like we should care about the characters. The second half of the book is certainly more dynamic, but it seems so flat when the first half is summarized so briefly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why oh why would any filmmakers want to impose a 21st Century Political Correctness agenda on a 19th Century classic? Deapite very good performances from Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, Geoffrey Rush and Claire Daines, this version of LES MISERABLES becomes ridiculous. About 60% through the movie, coherence and sanity are set aside and the "diversity agenda" kicks in; apparently the primary goal of the filmmaker, and Victor Hugo with his 1832 France can just go hang.Please don't waste 2 hours+ of your leisure time with this turkey; as there are numerous superior screen versions. To name just one: the 1952 film by Lewis Milestone, starring Michael Rennie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should admit that I've never read Victor Hugo's novel, so I can't comment on how Bille August's movie compares. But I thought that it was a good movie. An obvious point is that protagonist Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) stole the bread in the first place because he was starving, as were pretty much all French peasants; what other choice did he have? OK, so there have been so many movie versions of "Les Miserables" that why did we need another one? Well, any way that they can get the story across is important. Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes all make the most of their roles. So I recommend this one. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It should have won some academy awards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is outstanding and very well told. Liam Neeson is fascinating, he should have won an oscar for best actor as well as Geofrey Rush for best supporting actor. This movie is very well acted. The ending was excellent, I enjoyed the whole movie from the beginning to the end. The plot isn't difficult to follow, it's very understandable instead. The story tells about a man from France who was in prison but he escaped of it, and a kind bishop let him live with him even if he was a fugitive. He tried to steal some silverware from the bishop's house, but the bishop found out about it and instead of punishing him, he gave him some silver candles that helped him to be the best major. After that, Javert (Geofrey Rush) who is a prefect looks for him, but he saw him like a major, and nobody believed him that the major was a fugitive from the justice. After several attempts the truth is revealed and the major has to escape again from Javert and look for a little girl who was adopted by a heartless family, he does it because a sick employer pleaded to him to look for her before dying. He found the little girl and took her with him for many years and lived with her in a convent. After she was a young lady she didn't want to be a nun, she wanted to be in love, so she got out of the house and saw a man, and she fell in love with him, but his adopted father (the fugitive) didn't agree, because that was time of revolution and also because he was hiding from the justice, especially from Jarvert. Javert spotted him in the convent and tried to kill him. The revolution took place too and many people got killed and the man who was in love with the girl got very injured, after a while the fugitive had the opportunity to kill Jarvert, but he didn't because of his honor. Javert told him that he would never get rid of him, the only way to get rid of him was his death. Javert got the fugitive (Liam Neeson) in order to kill him, but he didn't, because he realized that the fugitive was a good person who had honor and many qualities, so he kills himself by handcuffing himself and drowning in a lake. At the ending he is free forever and his daughter was happy with his love who was recovering from his wounds. Great movie, you should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I haven't read the book nor have I seen the musical, but seeing this picture made me realise that I should indulge in some Les Miserables reading. I'm sure most fans of the novel will despise this film, but since the majority will not have come across the novel, the film will serve them well. I suppose the film might have needed an extra hour to flesh out certain sequences but I suspect the director might not have had full control.The film deals with good and evil which lurks within us, that's the basic meat of the story. Can a convict man become a reformed human? The film tries to answer the question, and I think it does it well. The love story might have lacked, there seemed very little attention between Liam Neeson and Uma Thurman, shame because for me this was very important to the story.The acting is amazing, trust me, Geoffrey Rush and Liam Neeson deserve to be awarded. Uma Thurman was excellent, her best role so far.The direction was pretty good, although, Bill August could've made better use of the panavision width in certain scenes.The photography is beautiful, stunning blues, the film MUST be seen in wide-screen!Excellent film, but probably not for fans of the book. Maybe the director wanted to take the story in a different direction? This film has been made so many times, it really needed the freshness, but then again, how many times does Les Miserables need to be made???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6th major non-musical version nearly the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world did not really and truly need yet another film version of the classic Victor Hugo novel. Guess what? It's an excellent film in all departments with brilliant performances from all the leads. It doesn't take any chances with material, remaining faithful to a fault to the novel. Some of the political overtones, while not played out, are mentioned in a non-confusing manner. We don't care nearly as much about Uma Thurman as we should on an emotional level, but it's not a major flaw of the film. It's 2 hour and 20 minute length glides by. A triumph. This becomes the second definitive version of the film (after the 1930's March/Laughton version).Geofrey Rush does a wonderful job giving his obsessed inspector enough frailities and faults for him to be very human and even more despicable and ultimately pitiful. Neeson shines in another towering performance deserving of much appreciation.It may not have been essential, but it is a film very much worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a good film of the novel if a bit "flat"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A straightforward film version of Victor Hugo's masterpiece. Almost a bit too "flavorless" to do the story the justice. Liam Neeson is brilliant and Uma Thurman, well what can one say about this very talented actress, except that we should have seen more of her. More could have been made of the relationship of Valjean and Fantine, the actors certainly had some connection - this is a movie after all, not a play! The film does tend to jump a bit and we are not given enough time to get attached Cossette, whom looks a bit too doll-ish, young or old. A surprise is a very good performance by Geoffrey Rush (Javert), so good in fact that you forget that he is acting and really start to dislike him. This dislike turns to pity in the end.Overall a very good representation of the novel. Simple enough to take a senior school class studying the book to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie doesn't do justice to book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the movie, my reaction is, "Huh?" I'm most likely biased, having read the book numerous times and being a fan of the musical. The movie when taken alone and not as a representation of Hugo's classic is fairly decent, but I cannot separate it from the novel. There are far too many deviations from the novel, particularly in the Paris scenes. And the choices made are bizarre--for instance, why did they include Gavroche's two little boys, but did not give Enjolras a part of any size? It's all very confusing.That having been said, the actors do a fine job. Geoffrey Rush makes a good Javert and Liam Neeson does do a good job as Valjean. I find the enlarged part of Cosette annoying and though Uma Thurman did well as Fantine, far too much time was spent with her.Should you rent this movie? If you're a fan of the book (or the musical), no. If you're unfamiliar with the story, then go ahead. Just don't expect a movie that will help you on a test of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie myself, but a friend of mine, named Marco, who has a mum who looks young enough to be his sister, one day in my homeroom at school, didn't stop criticising the 1998 version of Le Miserables. He told me that the acting displayed by Geoffrey Rush was lazy and uninteresting. Marco even stated to me that he believed Liam Neeson's character was terrible and he liked him a lot better in Taken, and pleaded to me that he wanted there to be more crazy Albanians in Le Miserables, like the ones from Taken. After he had finished criticising Le Miserables to me, he then began to explain to me how much he hated the musical 'jersey Boys'.

		<shortDescription>Not the best version, but better than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An admirable adaptation of a very difficult novel to put to screen. This one amalgamated the several books into one story, which is the easiest way. Missing some important plot points, but nothing integral. The best version I've seen was a French version, with, IIRC, Gerard Depardieu as Jean Valjean.Geoffrey Rush is the standout here. Liam Neeson does a fairly good job (and his size helps to make his role believable), but Geoffrey Rush is superb. I was disappointed in Uma Thurman and Claire Danes, however - I know them both to be capable of acting much more strongly than they showed here. And Claire Danes, being an American with a sad British accent in a French story was amusing at most.Overall, the film is definitely a good watch. For Geoffrey Rush's performance alone, if nothing else. Though I suggest reading the book above all else, as it's magnificent! And Victor Hugo's epic is one that can never truly be adapted to the silver screen. That aside, this is one of the better jobs I've seen and I recommend it. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Les Miserables" for dummies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so often stated by users of this website that "the book was better than the film" that I could scream from the appalling dimwittedness of the comment. The medium of written story telling gives the author the latitude to paint pictures with broad brushstrokes, leaving the details to the individual creative consciousness of the reader making the reading experience intensely personal. However, in film, the director has no such luxury and must fill in the blanks left by the author on behalf of the reader by presenting real imagery leaving considerably less to the imagination of the audience than the author left to the reader. Hence, in film, a story is much less personal than in print which is why we so often hear "the book was better". It would be impossible to do justice to Victor Hugo's classic novel "Les Miserables" in the space of a feature film. However, "Les Miserables" (1998) does capture the essence of the story, hitting all the high points with a competent cast, suitable locations, and par sundries. Director August does an adequate job of compressing the expansive tale of sweeping human emotions into 2+ hours making it a worthwhile watch for those who simply want to experience a sort of digest of the classic novel. In short, if you want to experience the full depth and breadth of Hugo's tale, read the book. However, if you want a condensed version without all that reading, this film is will give you what you want. (B)</fullReview>
