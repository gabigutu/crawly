		<shortDescription>Brilliant drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in "Rainman", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This outstanding film has about the best acting that you'll ever see, and that alone makes this a must-see. The entire cast is excellent, but then again, it had to be in order to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good, this is top-notch entertainment. This is a rare film that actually deserved all the Oscar recognition that it received. See it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrific acting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself lucky that I got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great to me because I think I could relate to it.Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. Through this movie, actually, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and I had.Back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this for a lot of people, because I think most can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent and Solid Film About Divorce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a decade of turbulent unrest, American movies began to switch gears and turn their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social unease to the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt."Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it's one of the best. It gets a rather bum rap now, because it's known as the film that beat "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely the same, but can't we enjoy them both? Director/writer Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie; its strength lies in its performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep particularly, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody, and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating, and feels authentic. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or Streep's straying mom as a villain. They're neither good or bad as people -- they're simply bad at being married.The film is tear-jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. It earns its right to elicit sobs.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great End to a Great Decade of Best Picture Winners.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" is probably the weakest winner of the Best Picture Oscar in the 1970s, but that does not mean that this it is not an excellent film that more than delivers. The film deals with a career man (Oscar-winner Dustin Hoffman) who must rear his young son (Justin Henry, the youngest Oscar-nominee ever) after his wife (Oscar-winner Meryl Streep) leaves them with no real explanation. What follows is a heart-touching story about the man who finally learns what it means to be a father and a boy who learns who his father really is. Of course the film becomes heart-rending later as Streep returns after a long absence and wants to take Hoffman to court for custody of their son. "Kramer vs. Kramer" then becomes an intense courtroom drama that has few equals. Robert Benton's Oscar-winning direction and screenplay could have fallen flat several times, but he stays focused throughout and his plan works to near perfection. Of course the aforementioned performances and the performance of Oscar-nominee Jane Alexander are the primary calling cards of the film. Hoffman and Streep are at the top of their careers here and their acts are electric and thunderous from start to finish. All in all, "Kramer vs. Kramer" could have been unintentionally funny or even down-right dull, but the film is so well-made and acted that it succeeds with stunning results. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benton's greatest Writing and Directing, his achievement in film winning all the top major Oscars of 1979</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer is a character based story just like his "Human Stain(2003)" and "The Late Show(1977)". 2 of his 3 Oscar awards are belong to Kramer vs. Kramer, for his success on directing and writing; thus making his film bringing a real life drama with the real life characters so close to us. It's all about ordinary people with our problems. What's different and catchy about Robert Benton's film-making was here we are not trying to put ourselves in the actors' shoes, the actors are trying to put themselves in our shoes.The story is about the Kramer family which is broken, father and mother are separated, and they have to fight for their son's custody in court against each other. After his wife walks out on him, Ted Kramer's life completely turns upside down. He has to take care of his son, Billy; but at the same time he's very busy with his position in an advertising company. Soon, he loses his job; Billy has an accident; his wife wants Billy to live with her. Against all the problems Ted is facing, he always fought with his heart. Ted's a very emotional and sensitive man, but a strong person at the same time.Ted Kramer character was a new model for Dustin Hoffman. But since the late 1950s' Elia Kazan's pioneer approach of modern drama making on film, with the basic instalment of the leading actor into a conflict, Ted Kramer's strong character raised Dustin Hoffman's acting to become a legend ; just like it did to Marlon Brando, Sylvester Stallone, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson with 1970s'.Something more about the movie; the linear cut has been 43 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Most of this cut has included Meryl Streep's deleted scenes. Also Meryl Streep has been originally cast in the role of Ted's one night stand, eventually played by second supporting actress Jobeth Williams. Meryl Streep's role as Joanna Kramer has been primarily offered to Kate Jackson; but due to her contract rules with the TV-series Charlie's Angels, she hasn't been able to accept this role. Joanna Kramer character has been designed to be the leading actress and subject to have more scenes, before director Benton making the last decision of the plot's focus point.Both Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman today have splendid fame on movie career, and Kramer vs. Kramer was an important milestone for both of their careers. Dustin Hoffman's Oscar speech winning the best actor at the 1979 Academy Awards ceremony is one of the best Oscar speeches of all Academy Awards history; like the movie Hoffman's Oscar speech is also available to watch on Youtube.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a rip-off, but a great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although credit should have been given to Dr. Seuess for stealing the story-line of "Horton Hatches The Egg", this was a fine film. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor throughout help keep a "heavy" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. Lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hoffman's bests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget. It isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but it does not mean it still isn't important. I thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance along with Meryl Streep, playing the depressed mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best films he's ever done. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally touching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly I'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what I've just witness. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I've witnessed for a long time that even I, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. The characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding, I can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times, when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Divorce Et L'Infant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word that comes to mind when describing 'Kramer vs. Kramer' is terrific. Benton's direction and screenplay are solid but what also seems to have worked very well was that he gave his actors the freedom to improvise and was open to their suggestions. Not once, does the film lose focus (credit goes to the fine editing department). It's very much a character driven drama with fabulous acting. Perhaps, it's the freedom the actors had which makes their performances look more natural and their on screen interactions very real. I wonder how cathartic it was for the great Dustin Hoffman to play Ted Kramer as he himself was going through a rough divorce. A brilliant Meryl Streep too was still in the grieving process of having lost her loved one. The fabulous Jane Alexander seems to have a comfortable off screen interaction with her co-stars and she too did a lot of improvisation. The same can be said for child actor Justin Henry. The result is excellent performances by all four actors. The whimsical score (that comprises of famous numbers from composers like Vivaldi) beautifully adds to the mood. These days court room divorce dramas have become quite popular on TV but they lack the authenticity, humbleness and simplicity of 'Kramer vs Kramer'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie, with excellent performances by Dustin Hoffman, Jane Alexander, and the kid Justin Henry. However, unfortunately Meryl Streep's role isn't really very developed and we don't get to understand very well what is going on with her.The film shows the agony of people going through a contested Court battle over custody. Although the agony is very real for those going through this, it needs to be noted that the more modern approach to a custody dispute is to require the parties to mediate their differences. By stressing the concept of "parenting time", in which time with the child is divided in a reasonable way between the two parents, as opposed to the "either-or" choice depicted in the film, differences can often be worked out in mediation by simply working out a schedule of who has the child when.SPOILER COMING UP Another problem with the film is the screenwriter's assumption that the mother should receive custody unless she is unfit. This has not been the law for many, many years, if indeed it ever was. In this situation, where the child had bonded so wonderfully with his father, it seems doubtful that even the older Judges would award custody to the mother. Judges will usually continue whatever the status quo arrangement has been, if it is working, as it was in the film. Certainly the mother would not be permitted to come in and litigate custody, simply because she has changed her mind. Rather, it is necessary to show a "change of circumstances" to even get into Court.The story is told from a decidedly upper middle class viewpoint. Both parents have good jobs, and the film seems to accept the idea that a person's worth as a parent is determined by how good of a job he or she has. During the Court hearing, when the mother says how much she is making, the camera shows the father's surprised reaction. The mother's attorney is eliciting this information to show how she has "gotten herself together", and therefore should now be granted custody. And when the father loses his job right before the hearing, he desperately finds another one because he "knows" he has no chance at custody unless he has a good job. And then during the hearing, the mother's attorney derides him for making less than he had previously made.I submit that this viewpoint is just plain false. One's worth as a parent does not depend on how much money one makes! Indeed, it could be argued that the reverse is actually true, in that the less time spent on making a living, the more time and energy one has to devote to the care of one's children. The issue is not who has the best job, but who can best care for the children. Who is the most willing to go the parent-teacher conferences, take the children to the doctor, read to them a story at bedtime, etc.Despite the various flaws in the film, it still rates an 8 out of 10 due to the very strong performances, and the wonderful way it shows the developing relationship between a father and his son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family movie about an advertising executive in which drama takes place when the wife decides to leave him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This family drama results to a highly acclaimed film that deal with Ted (Dustin Hoffman, James Caan was offered the role of Ted Kramer, but turned it down) , a just-divorced man who must learn to care for his son (Justin Henry) on his own when their wife (Meryl Streep shot her scenes for Manhattan during breaks in filming and Meryl was originally cast in the role of Ted's one-night-stand, eventually played by JoBeth Williams) and mother leaves . There subsequently takes place the ordinary battle for custody when she returns . And then must fight in court to keep custody of him .Moving and dramatic picture based on the novel by Avery Corman with an excellent plethora of players who give exacting interpretations . It successfully moves you from laughter to tears and back again . Very good acting by Dustin Hoffman as an adverting executive husband , he deservedly won Academy Award and Meryl Streep as his wife and mother who leaves on quest to find herself and also won Oscar to best support actress . Justin Henry was Oscar nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, Henry at age 8 became the youngest ever person to be nominated for this award as well as the youngest ever Oscar nominee in any category, a record which still stands today . Magnificent support cast , such as Jane Alexander as Margaret Phelps , Howard Duff as John Shaunessy , George Coe as Jim O'Connor and JoBeth Williams , whose funny nude scene was optically darkened for the film's theatrical run, to avoid an R rating. Classic soundtrack , as the music played during the opening credits is Antonio Vivaldi's Mandolin Concerto . Colorful cinematography by Nestor Almendros ; director Robert Benton advised cinematographer to base the look and color of the film on the paintings of Piero Della Francesca , Almendros also used the work of David Hockney as an inspiration, and designed a realistic look, using source lighting in rooms with ceilings and available light in exteriors . First of two back-to-back consecutive movies to win the Academy Award for Best Picture that was a contemporary film drama about interpersonal relationships and family bonds , the next year's winner was Ordinary People directed by Robert Redford . Ranked #3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Courtroom Drama" and was the highest-grossing movie of 1979.The motion picture was compellingly directed by Robert Benton . Texas director has a varied career as he was an editor of magazine , production designer , set decorator and has written a number of imaginative stories for children . He realized few movies even accounting for those in whose screenplays he wrote as ¨Bonnie and Clyde¨ , ¨There was a crooked man¨ , ¨What's up doc ?¨ , ¨Superman¨ and even ¨Still of the night¨ . His big hit as director was this Weepie ¨Kramer vs Kramer¨ and won him the Oscar for writing and direction , the next was warm-hearted ¨Places in the heart¨ with basic human values and revealed his softer side . Following filmmaking the underrated ¨Nadine¨ , a comic-strip comedy with Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger and ¨Still of the night¨ was a failure and turned out to be a flop at the box office . After that , he directed a gangster movie ¨Billy Bathgate¨ with Nicole Kidman and Dustin Hoffman , ¨Nobody's fool¨ which won Paul Newman an Academy Award nomination and he worked again with Benton four years later on ¨Twilight¨ . Rating : Notable ,above average . The picture will appeal to Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep fans .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Kramer vs. Kramer' succeeds so tremendously, not because it shows us something that we've never seen before, but because it shows us life as we know it. The relationship between Ted Kramer and his young son Billy is really nothing remarkable ? almost every father in the world shares a similar bond with his own son ? and yet, paradoxically, this is what makes the film such a remarkable achievement: it is a window into real-life. That year, though 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' was undoubtedly the more impressive piece of cinema, the Academy decided to award the top honours to a film that was more intimate and closer-to-home {perhaps they were also hesitant, after 'The Deer Hunter (1978),' to reward a war picture two years in a row}. 'Kramer vs. Kramer' received, not only Best Picture, but also a well-deserved Best Actor {Dustin Hoffman's first win}, Best Director {Robert Benton}, Best Adapted Screenplay {Robert Benton} and Best Actress in a Supporting Role {Meryl Streep's first win}. Young Justin Henry, aged 8 years, became the youngest actor in history to be nominated for a competitive Oscar.At the beginning of the film, we are immediately aware that Ted Kramer (Hoffman) is not a perfect husband. His commitment to work means that he has largely neglected his strained wife, Joanna (Streep), and, indeed, he isn't even listening to her when she finally announces her intentions to leave him. With Joanna having departed for California in order to "find herself," Ted is left alone to care for their young son Billy (Justin Henry), during which time he must juggle both his working and family lives. As Ted takes up this mammoth task, we notice that, up to this point, he hasn't been much of a father, either, blundering his attempts to make a simple breakfast and having to ask in which grade-level his son belongs. Eventually, however, though it reflects rather poorly on his career, Ted and Billy formulate a truly touching father-son relationship, and, for the first time, Ted seems satisfied with his family life ? until, that is, Joanna returns to claim custody of the child.Perhaps it's just being a male that influenced my emotions, but I absolutely loathed Joanna Kramer. The mere notion of a mother walking out on her son, only to return 15 months later with the expectation of receiving custody, left me absolutely livid, and, were it not for the character's final act, I might even have labelled her as the film's "villain." However, to do so would probably oppose the primary message of the film, which is that both Ted and Joanna are young Billy's parents, and that they must each come to accept this, and to accept that they are both equally responsible for the well-being of their child. The ending of the film, with the elevator door closing to irreparably separate Ted and Joanna once more {destroying any idealistic hopes that the two would get back together} creates an open-endedness to the story that I thought was very suitable. As in real-life, there is no clear resolution to the story, and the future is hopeful but uncertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer Vs. Kramer" is a movie-of-the-week made moving by grade A+ actors. This is not to discount the film... it isn't terrible, but without the great performances by both Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep- who flesh out their rather-thin characters into nearly realistic people- it is much ado about nothing.I was disappointed watching the film because there was nothing memorable about it... it was a slight experience marked by a lack of substance. Even on the second viewing many years later I had forgotten the film as quickly as the end credits had rolled. What WAS important about this movie was that it represented the first-time Hollywood really acknowledged the downfall of the American family, an endangered species being increasingly torn apart by divorce in which the children emerged as victims and pawns. I'm sure it was more sensational at the time of it's release... but today a woman leaving her husband and forcing him to raise their son alone is not going to win Best Picture... a film today with a plot that tame might never get made. I suspect in fact that "Kramer's" Oscar sweep was due more to the film's amazingly talented actors- both at the top of their game- than the actual film itself. Streep is very good in a role that is *entirely* unsympathetic... we're given no reason for her departure and no rationale for abandoning her child. A lesser actress in this role would have had the audience hissing, but Meryl Streep gives us at least some insight as to Mrs. Kramer's motivations. Dustin Hoffman is great, believable as a father and human enough to engage anyone. The film sidesteps many key issues very cleverly, such as never showing us Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kramer happy together, a necessity since Hoffman and Streep are not only unlikely as man and wife, they also share zero chemistry, unless of course they're out-acting one another from opposite sides of the courtroom.A film that stands the test of time will linger on your mind, bear repeated viewings, and be just as vital today as the day it was made... "Kramer Vs. Kramer" is long past its expiration date. The performances are still watchable, but not essential in either actor's canon; Hoffman and Streep have both been in many timeless films... "Kramer Vs. Kramer" is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy subject matter and well meaning, but with one major problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is an advertising executive whose career means everything to him. In fact, it means so much to him that his wife Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) can no longer tolerate his behaviour anymore. Joanna leaves Ted and also leaves their 8 year old child in his care. However, Ted finds himself in new territory when he now finds that he has to struggle juggling both working full-time and looking after his son.This is a film that for me will always be relevant - it's actually probably more relevant now than it was when it was made as divorce rates are probably higher now than they were in the 1970's. The film begins OK; Joanna leaves Ted and we find ourselves engaged when Ted is forced to actually take an active role in being a parent. It shows how much he relied on Joanna and clearly he took her for granted (of course he only realises how much she actually did after she left him). This is all fine to begin with, but the problem I had with this film is Joanna's disappearance for 15 months. 15 months? Really? What kind of mother would do that? I expected her to perhaps leave Ted with their kid for a few days possibly a week to give him a lesson in parenting, but I just couldn't accept that any rational parent would disappear for that long. Later in the film, Joanna does explain her reasons for going away, but I still didn't buy it. I don't care what anyone else says, abandoning your kid for that long is unacceptable!! There are many things that this film gets right and one thing I did like about it is that it does, at least, represent both parents as being flawed individuals. It would have been very easy for the writers to put all the blame at the door of one of the parents, but this would have been both unfair and unrealistic. There are many humorous and heart-felt moments during the film - many of which involved Ted and his son. I'll admit that I was pleased that his son ended up bonding better with Ted towards the end.Despite the fact that Ted was made out to be the villain of the piece at the start of the film, I personally found that I connected more with his character than I did with Joanna. I think the main reason for this is that I saw that he was flawed as a person rather than bad - look at the pressure he was under at work (even his boss kept telling him that his work is more important than his family - he didn't use those exact words, but it's quite clear that he wanted Ted to put his job before his family). Yes Ted should have remembered that blood is thicker than water, but at the end of the day he needed to keep his job to provide for his family. He made mistakes, but I actually liked his character. It perhaps would have been better if Joanna's character was developed better as we would have then got more of an insight into her characters thoughts/feelings and I would have then been able to connect to her character. However, her character is quite thinly written so it's actually impossible to do this. Kramer vs Kramer is an enjoyable film that is funny and heart-felt and both Hoffman and Streep were excellent. It probably deserves a 7 or 8 out of 10, but I was so annoyed by Joanna's actions that I had to downgrade it to a 6 out of 10. It's still a film that I would whole heartedly recommend watching though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen many Dustin Hoffman's movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. I expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This drama is considered successful. I think it is not because it tells us anything special, or that the characters are particularly worthy.I believe it is because of the way the narrative is constructed. It has two arcs.One of these has the husband establishing the world. We follow only him, spending time understanding what he is about and how he adapts. Against this domestic environment, the wife has only one speech. This is in a café. She tells us ahead of time that it is a speech that she has prepared and practiced. This is purely within the real world. Since we are presented the man's world only, this insight-by-reactive-speech is unbalanced. We strive to understand. In the end, she succumbs to the guy's reality.By itself, this narrative arc would be insufficient. The second arc is the trial. We know courtrooms in film. We know what they mean. They place us as the jury. We cannot leave the theater without making a judgment. In this, our woman also has only one speech. What makes this work, I believe, is how one layer is imposed on the other. It works less well today that when it was new. In part this is because we've worn out the power of the courtroom genre. When this was fresh, the simple appearance of the place and its rituals would be enough to convey an entire narrative dynamic.The other is that when it was new, it was a novel idea that a woman could have her own inner life. Believe me, this was true. So the unusual nature of her leaving and her speeches provided a balance because they were so extraordinary. The insertion of a "sexually liberated" woman to sleep once with Hoffman's character ? and the fact that she was a lawyer ? underscored this urge.But today, that balancing mechanism is gone. We see today a film about a guy and not a marriage. The balanced dynamic between the two people is gone. The balanced dynamic between the two story arcs is gone as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. Everyone in this one turned in a flawless performance in a story dedicated to showing the ugliness of divorce. This was a solid, serious movie but it also had a humorous side as Hoffman had me rolling the floor as he dealt with fatherhood, completely, for the first time. I especially found the french toast scene roaringly funny. 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to perfection as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie as a young child, where my memories of it were more about parents fighting over their child and not much else. However, 33 years later, as I watch this beautiful character piece again through the eyes of a proud and loving father, it's messages and emotionally compelling performances touched my heart and leave a lasting impression.Everything about this movie is near perfection. From the writing, to the directing, acting and cinematography, as the incredible Dustin Hoffman said in his Oscar acceptance speech after winning Best Actor for Kramer vs. Kramer, everyone that worked on this film is part of the "artistic family" that made it the success it was.Without giving too much away and ruining the discovery of Ted Kramer, to put it as simply as possible, this movie is about one thing... a man who discovers that his love for his child exceeds any and all self needs and wants, and is willing to make any sacrifice to ensure that his child never feels abandoned again. Through this journey we get to watch a bond develop between a father and son that is very real, yet all to rare, in 1979 or present day.I have noticed that some people on here have taken this movie to be a "political piece" that it's point is to make a statement that men can raise children as good as women. I think anyone who has drawn that conclusion has robbed themselves of enjoying the relationship journey of Ted Kramer and his son that makes Kramer vs. Kramer one of my favorite movies of all time.If you have children, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's a very touching a true account of how one dedicated and selfless parent can make a huge difference in a child's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a Manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. Toss in parenthood for Dustin Hoffman. The movie is textured and deep. It follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son. While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an Oscar? She sure can deliver when she is on, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman vs. Streep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years "Kramer vs. Kramer" has grown out to be one of the widely best known dramas. And yes this is for a good reason. Every textbook drama element is present in the movie and it's a great example of how to make a good and honest genre movie, without ever cheating the viewers. With that I mean, without ever getting overly sappy or melodramatic, although the movie its drama gets predictable in parts. But isn't that the case in basically every drama-movie?"Kramer vs. Kramer" above all is a real character movie. I mean, it's not like the story is that much special, or something that hasn't been done before in any other form or shape. It are really the actors that make the characters and emotions come alive. Without its stars this movie wouldn't had risen above the level of an average made for TV movie, if I'm being completely fair.The concept of the movie also really doesn't sounds too much interesting. A movie about a divorce? Come on! How special can that be. Why should you even ever watch a movie on this subject? Well, let me tell you that "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a very special movie that knows how to move you. I guess that the movie should be especially recognizable and all the more touching for people whose parents really went to a divorce and had a 'fight' over custody.The biggest strength of the movie is that it all feels very real. Not just the events but especially and foremost the characters and how they act and respond to certain situations. The movie and its drama feels so real because the characters also feel so real. So kudos to Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep (although her role is not as big as you would expect), who both won an Oscar for this movie but also to the young Justin Henry as the young son and Jane Alexander, who both received an Oscar nomination. So the movie was nominated in all acting categories, which should say enough about the acting power that's in this movie. Dustin Hoffman's character really transforms throughout the movie, when he tries to as good as a father as possible. It's really touching to see.The movie shows how hard parenthood is and foremost shows that there can't be such a thing as the 'perfect parent'. It also helps to give this movie a very honest and straight-forward feeling, like with so many '70's movie also was the case.A movie that's unique in its sort and is above most other genre-movies.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly directed, acted, shot and written ? a genius piece of character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what some call one of the most perplexing decisions made by the Academy when Kramer vs. Kramer was awarded the 1979 best picture Oscar over Apocalypse Now, after viewing the said film; I can say that for whatever reasons they had, they had them on good grounds. The reason I can't say if they're right or not is because I haven't seen Apocalypse Now.Kramer vs. Kramer is a character study ? it's a raw character study of two people called Ted Kramer (A then 42 year old Dustin Hoffman) and Billy Kramer (A then 8 year old Justin Henry) who are living together because Joanna Kramer (A then 30 year old Meryl Streep) walked out on them. What's good is that this happens really early on in the film so there's no need for build up towards Joanna and we don't immediately know the reasons for her walk out which means that after five minutes of her and an hour and half of the other two; who do you think the audience are going to make the link with and, ultimately, root for.To say that this film merely centres around two people living in a New York apartment is too-a premature statement. The film slowly builds up, biding its time and brilliantly placing its scenes of a different nature as the fist hour to an hour and a half goes by. The way in which Ted Kramer tries to balance his work and the time he spends with Billy proves to us how busy he really was when there were three in the household. Also, the way in which things get more and more desperate as the film wares on is heart and gut wrenching. Sorry if this does sound like a spoiler but Ted's attempts to merely 'blag' his life as he sits on top of a brilliant portfolio and a big promotion business-wise yet home comes-a-calling whenever things look good is simple yet truly gripping film-making. Not only this but we start off with a simple thing like making breakfast and his attempts to do that right ? just the way Billy likes it; it doesn't go a hundred per cent correct but it'll do. However, on the scale of things that was just one breakfast the morning after Joanne left, now think of the bigger more important things.What's also clever about Kramer vs. Kramer are the little things that perhaps go unnoticed. The fact that Joanne is made to look like the antagonist yet barely features for the first third. When she does eventually turn up, the film is turned on its head and the routine we've got used to suddenly flips over and goes down a different route. This just places the audience more and more in Ted's shoes and it's fantastic when you think about it. Also, the fact that one of my favourite sequences involves a long tracking shot early in the morning as Billy walks into the kitchen, notices Ted reading a newspaper, sits down and as the camera reaches its destination; it pauses ? expecting something to be said but nothing happens and we cut away to the next scene ? fantastic stuff.With Ted's desperation getting more and more intense as his job and life begin to crumble around him as well as Joanne's re-emergence from the woodwork and her demands ? it can be looked at as tragic yet entertaining, wholly depending on whether you've been through a divorce or not only this will only further place you in the shoes of Ted.Kramer vs. Kramer is a well directed, well acted and well shot film that plays with film conventions and successfully plays with the audience as well ? definitely recommended if you're after something smart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story of a family. The movie begins with the wife, Joanna, leaving her husband, Ted in charge of their seven year-old son, Billy. Throughout the next year, Ted and Billy learn to live with each other. At first, this young boy cannot comprehend that his mother has left him. Ted continues to work hard at being the parent his son needs. Eventually, both have all but forgotten their mom. They live in perfect harmony now. Then the mother reappears. She hasn't been present for almost a year and a half, and now she is wanting custody of this confused little boy. And the court seems to side with her.It takes a while afterward for the true meaning of this movie to settle in. It's a beautiful story and a great cast, but it also touches on a very serious issue. The court system of today favors women over men again and again and again. This movie shows the disastrous and ridiculous effects of that. That's why it's such an important film.The cast really is brilliant here. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep both give Oscar-deserving and winning performances. Hoffman is exquisite as the struggling and loving father Ted. Ms. Streep gives a superb performance as the somewhat confused mother. You'll hate her sometimes and truly feel for her others, but she acts beautifully. The little boy, Justin Henry, is also excellent.Watch this movie. It won five Oscars and deserved them all. The cast is great, the story beautiful, and the message important. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Divorce Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie about the trials and tribulations of divorce and its often shattering effect on a broken family with their young son caught up in a bitter custody battle. The greatest scenes are the beautifully moving interactions with Dustin Hoffman and his adoring 6-year son, played magnificently by young Justin Henry. The performances are very realistic. The directing is face-paced, and no one at any time seems superficial in their roles. Anyone who has gone through, or is going through a divorce, or even a bad marriage, will find some great meaning and insight from this movie.The only drawback is Meryl Streep. I always believed that she was an over-rated actress. But in Kramer vs. Kramer, there is something missing from her character that I think creates an aloofness in the scenes that she is in. I could tell from her body language very early on in this movie that she had strong emotional problems. Throughout the film, she seems so quiet and unsure of herself that you begin to feel even MORE sensitivity for the real troubling issues facing Ted (Dustin) and Billy. (Justin) Their scenes together are SOOOO well done that you really see them as a father and son and not actors. There is also no sappiness or soap opera dialog to muddle this fine story. I must also give credit to director Robert Benton for a movie that pulls at the heart strings many times.This is a very fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Don't Divorce Your Kids...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years, walks out on him, leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. For instance, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she's leaving him, she doesn't just storm out the door...she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim...it was thought about and Joanna felt, with no other option than to leave, if she was leaving she was going to do it properly...and with no specific plan in mind, she did not think it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too...Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream...Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party...Billy catching his dad's one night stand (JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom stark naked, but it's the moments of human drama you remember...Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym...Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper..."Shame on you." And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind? But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Heart-Wrenching Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago, and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie held my attention from beginning to end, and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about.)Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and effective tale of divorce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, simplicity wins over the rest. In a book, a simple story might be favored. In a meal, something simple may be what you crave. But in a movie, most people do not want simplicity. They want the whole shebang. They want a spectacle. Mostly, they aren't right. Simplicity has made many movies. Kramer Vs. Kramer is one of them.Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is an overworked advertising executive. Ted is married and has a 7 year old son, Billy (Justin Henry). One day, Ted arrives home and gets instantly on the phone. This is the time Joanna (Meryl Streep) chooses to tell Ted that she is leaving him and that she is not taking their son with her. Ted is not only sad, but also alarmed. She was the one who raised the kid. He doesn't have a clue about how to do it. Joanna leaves and the next morning, Ted tries to explain to Billy how his mother has left. Billy, at first, wants everything to be done by his mother. He cries and throws fits. But, gradually, they learn to cooperate and be like father and son. That is, until Joanna comes back and asks for custody of Billy.The movie wallows in simplicity. The plot doesn't seem like much, but it works. More than a few times, I could relate to what was happening. (No, my parents weren't divorced.) For instance, when Billy falls off the monkey bars and busts his face, Ted takes him to the emergency. When I was around 7 or 8 years old, my younger brother also busted his face (in a different way) and my father's reaction was quite similar to Dustin Hoffman's. The scenes, while mundane in the sense that they happen to you in you everyday life, are effective and never boring.The acting, as I pointed out above, is suprisingly natural. Dustin Hoffman, who won an Oscar for his solid work, gives a performance that is very true to life. His work isn't very intense, but low-key. He is just playing a ?regular guy', but I think it takes much more talent to play someone like that than to play a broader role like the guy from The Graduate (not that I'm saying he was bad in that movie). Justin Henry shows maturity and control for a little kid, and he isn't the least bit obnoxious. He captured the innocence very well. My favorite scene is when Hoffman sleeps with a woman, Phyllis (JoBeth Williams) and she gets up to go to the washroom. She is naked. She walks down the hall and bumps into little Billy, who seems hardly fazed. He then innocently asks her if she likes fried chicken. It's a well-written and touching scene. Meryl Streep plays the wife admirably, but she has too little screen time and therefore is stuck in a supporting part.As a whole, the movie works admirably well. However, there are some small quibbles, the biggest being the ending. It comes too fast and leaves too many loose ends. Sure, it's touching, but I want more of the movie! Clocking in at barely over an hour and a half, Kramer Vs. Kramer is quite short. I wish there was more material. Yet, Kramer Vs. Kramer remains a fine film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with a simple story, told superbly well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie always works for me, no matter how many times I see it. I often wonder how they took such a simple story and made it work so well. The answer would probably lie in the acting of all the cast, even the child actor Justin Henry. The chemisty between he and Dustin Hoffman made for some very memorable scenes, and this is why we get drawn into what seems to be an often told tale. Some of the best scenes for me are those that involve no dialogue, just action. We see them getting up in the morning, walking to the bathroom and into the kitchen. They co-operate without speaking; they get donuts for breakfast, milk, glasses, Hoffman reads the newspaper and Henry reads a comic book. Again, later, the day Henry is set to leave, they quietly make french toast, they do it like a well oiled machine unlike a previous scene where the impression was they didn't know too much about each other for a father and son, and quite obviously it was rare for Hoffman to be in the kitchen doing "mom" duties. We see them grow together throughout the movie, and this is the big attraction for me.There is no padding in this movie, each scene is needed and tells what it is supposed to. Unlike other movies of this theme, you never cringe, and you get a sense of these people and what they're about. The story is painfully honest, and superbly done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully done film rich with symbolisms that could be invisible to the unaware eyes. The elevator scene for example symbolizes two main themes of the movie, separation and emotion. One could notice that the first scene showed Joanna going down the elevator, symbolizing her feeling of depression, likewise Ted goes down the elevator after the last trial scene - knowing that he probably lost the case. On the other hand, Ted brings Billy to see his new office and it was another elevator trip but this time going up, showing the joy and excitement both have. Lastly, one could notice that both Ted and Joanna never are together in one elevator - with this we can foresee that they will never get together even in the end. The symbolism of separation with the use of the elevator shows this even though we never find out in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said in my review of RAIN MAN, a family drama doesn't have to be an epic (like fellow nominee APOCALYPSE NOW) to win Best Picture. (Coincidentally, Hoffman appeared in both films.) KRAMER VS. KRAMER isn't just about divorce, it's also about a father trying to connect with his son and juggle a successful career at the same time. This is something every mother, father, and even child can relate to. Dustin Hoffman is Ted Kramer, said father in this wrenching film. Meryl Streep is Joanna Kramer, the other half of the title. Jane Alexander is their friend and neighbor, Margaret Phelps. And 8-year-old Justin Henry is Ted and Joanna's son, Billy. Along for the emotional ride is Howard Duff, as Ted's lawyer John Shaunessy, and JoBeth Williams as Ted's bed partner and secretary, Phyllis. Based on the 1977 novel by Avery Corman, KRAMER VS. KRAMER deals with the effects of abandonment (this time by a mother!), divorce, estrangement, and reconnection. It is a sobering look at a successful executive who's life couldn't be better until his wife leaves him due to unsatisfaction and marital unhappiness. His attempt to connect with his little son, the boy's mother returning after "finding herself," and ending in a bittering custody battle. What can you say about this film? I'll tell you! It was something that I, a very stubborn young man, could understand and relate to. I, myself, was a child of a broken home. My parents were Ted and Joanna; and I was Billy! This film deserves every accolade it got! Anyone, who disagrees has either no heart or no common sense! (But, you're entitled to your opinion.) Winner of 5 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Stanley R. Jaffe, producer; Best Director and Adapted Screenplay - Robert Benton; Best Actor - Dustin Hoffman; and Best Supporting Actress - Meryl Streep; along with nominations for Justin Henry for Best Supporting Actor and Jane Alexander also as Best Supporting Actress. This is a film that inspires and unlifts the spirit just by telling a realistic story without explosions, special effects, or violence. Though I did enjoy APOCALYPSE NOW, I still think KRAMER VS. KRAMER deserved to win. Why? Because it made me cry, something that is very difficult to do! That scene where Ted and Billy say their supposed good-byes (Joanna wins, of course; the mother always wins!) tore me to shreds. Incredible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer Vs. Kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. He's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. He's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving Beyond Words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.One of "Kramer v. Kramer's" great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton, who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with "Places in the Heart", where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he has a natural ability for working with children.The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As said wife Joanne, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came his way.Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect.Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go.Certainly if nothing else, "Kramer v. Kramer" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.Saturday, June 10, 1995 - T.V.Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.This highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 Academy Awards for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep).Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy Oscars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think not! I mean yeah if you compare this film to The Godfather, or maybe a little older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good job to cute little Justin Henry. While I was watching this film for like the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed, cause I haven't seen any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five Oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.Thanks for your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Kind Of Over-Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KRAMER VS. KRAMER was a big hit for everyone involved when it came out in 1979 as it won awards for Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Supporting Actress for Meryl Streep and Best Picture. This movie was also significant as it is probably the first major movie to deal with divorce; an unfortunate but common occurrence in every day life. KRAMER VS. KRAMER tells the story of Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), an ad-executive who comes home one night only to find that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him with their 7 year old son Billy (played by Justin Henry). The movie goes through the day to day events as Ted tries to care for Billy and hold down a job. However, no sooner do the father and son learn to deal with one another that Joanna comes back and wants her son back. Of course, this leads to a court case where the two fight to have the kid. As was often the case with divorces at the time (this took place in the late '70's), the judge sided with the mother. However, after Joanna won the case, she came to decide at the very end that Billy indeed should stay with his father.In viewing this movie and I have done so a number of times over the years, I feel this movie is kind of over-rated. Here are some of the flaws that I see in the film. First of all, in the very beginning of the movie, we see that Joanna is packing her suitcase and basically announces to Ted that she is leaving. She doesn't seem to know where she is going or anything. Also, there does not seem to be any build up. True, the movie starts that way but I kind of felt there should have been a real confrontation between the couple first. On his part, it seemed like he had no sense that his wife was about to leave him although it is true that Ted Kramer was portrayed to be totally obsessed with his work. Of course, as I mentioned before, the bulk of the film deals with Ted learning to bond with his son. Another problem I had was that when Ted lost his job, he got a new one in "less than 24 hours." I realize that this was in the days before corporate downsizing laid people off in droves and it probably was not as hard to find another job that was self-supporting as it would be now. However, even back then, I don't think he would have found another job on a par of what he was doing (although it was considered a step-down for him) so fast despite his hustling for a new one. The movie does show that he was desperate to take ANY job at that point and it is true that when one is desperate, he or she will often do whatever it takes to get a new job. Anyway, I also had a problem with the way Ted conducted himself in the court scene when he was asked upsetting questions pertaining to how he made mistakes on the job and ultimately was let go. Granted, Ted was upset and rightfully so but I felt he should have handled himself better by keeping his answers short and not rambling on to defend his actions. As I mentioned before, at the time the movie took place, the judges almost always sided with the mother in a divorce but I do think the way Ted conducted himself may have contributed to why the judge went against him. Lastly, I felt that the ending did not seem plausible. At the end, Joanna, after winning the case, decided that her son did not belong with her but with his father instead. It did not make sense to me that she would have gone through all the trouble of fighting for custody only to say that her son did not belong with her although it was true that she did not really know what she wanted in her life. To me, a more realistic ending would have been that Billy went to live with his mother and that after work one day, Ted would go and pay a surprise visit to Billy. This would show Billy that while his father might not have full custody of him, his father would continue to be an important person in his life.In reading the comments I have just given, one might conclude that I did not like the film. That's not the case. It's just that I was pointing out what did not seem right to me. However, I did like the movie in the sense that some years ago, I took the time to buy a video-tape of it. Also, I enjoyed some of the scenes including where Ted makes French toast with his son. The scene where they do so after the trial showed how much closer they were from the beginning of the movie. Another scene worth mentioning is the famous one where the woman Ted is dating is staying over and Billy asks her (while she is naked) "Do you like fried chicken?" as it showed how cute and innocent he (Billy) really was. Overall, the movie did a good job of showing how Ted and his son bonded as there were scenes where they read together etc. I would say that was probably the strongest aspect of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very calculated and pressed out, but some of the manufactured heart is indeed moving...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ("It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the "motherly" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted. It all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. The film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light delight. It keeps you entertained, but it doesn't give you much to talk about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lead (Dustin) and both supporting (Merryl and Justin Henry 'Billy'), keep the audience mindful throughout, and hopeful for a big upcoming reward. But at every corner when the action appears to be about to throw you from your chair, it brings you right back down without never achieving a climax. The relationship between Ted and his son is pleasant to watch, but is just too uneventful. Someone might expect the courtroom scenes to present some kind of revelation and build to a climatic moment (the title of the movie directly refers to a court of law dispute between the two 'Kramer' parties), but all that is said we the audience already know. All that the two lawyers do is put up a show of bravado with nothing ingenious in their speeches and we remain without knowing what really led the jury to their verdict (we have to settle for the all too general remarks made during the movie which 'normally' lead a jury to decide). The film reaches a moment when is difficult to care about the fate of the child, I myself couldn't care less if our hero Dustin would keep custody, or if crying Meryl would be the one taking him home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer vs. Kramer was Groundbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman who won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Ted Kramer, Chris Henry who played Billy Kramer who was the youngest ever nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and last but not least Meryl Streep who plays Joanna Kramer the erratic mother of Billy Kramer and ex husband of Ted. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work. In the early moments of this film you see Joanna leaving Ted because he never listens to her and has a idea of what a wife should be like and she isn't but he doesn't understand that. Ted is now left with Billy who have troubles, whether it be trying to make breakfast, Ted having troubles at work or Billy spilling what looks like Cranberry juice on slides for Ted's big presentation which lead to him losing his job. The turning point of this film is when Billy decides to be a rebel and eat ice cream before eating dinner and Ted gets quite mad and throws him into his bed and calls him a little crap. Also, their is a strong friendship that continually builds between Joanna's good friend Margaret played by Jane Alexander and Ted. They have a lot in common, both were recently divorced and have young children. Later, Joanna comes back from her extended trip to LaLa land expecting to regain custody of her child. Her main tactic against Ted is saying that Ted caused Billy to "almost lose his eye". Everything ends well when Joanna steps up and decides that Billy's real home is his room in Ted's apartment. The final words lead us to believe that Ted and Joanna might get back together when he says "You look terrific." when she is going up to see Billy for what may or may not be the last time.

		<shortDescription>Benton's script is challenging, crowd-pleasing, and perfectly balanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Benton, a man from Texas whose previous screen writing credits include "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) and "Superman" (1978), had a very different and difficult task to achieve when he adapted the screenplay for "Kramer vs. Kramer." This is a story that, to tell correctly, demands perfect balance. The movie can lean to one Kramer's perspective, alternately Hoffman's character or Streep's, but it can never consign the other to a mere antagonist role: each has to be completely sympathetic and redeemable even when they are at their lowest or potentially in the wrong. The equation becomes more complicated when role-reversal is involved. If Hoffman's Kramer is any more or less capable a caregiver to their 7 year-old than Streep's Kramer, or if hers is any more or less driven to succeed in business than his, the balance and the film's message of equality become compromised. At the same time, if they are too perfectly malleable as characters they cease to be true-to-life and therefore lose their relevance as tools of social commentary; their clearly-delineated roles?a dissatisfied wife and a career-driven husband?are what determine the kinds of challenges each face, and their respective arcs remain linked to these initial identities even as they subvert their usual meanings and transcend their presumed limitations. Toward the end, Benton indulges in some overwrought courtroom theatrics ("OBJECTION!" "Overruled!"), and the resolution of the story is ultimately a bit of a cop-out, but it can be argued that these decisions also point to his wisdom as a screenwriter inasmuch as the film's message had already been conveyed and all that was left was to leave the audience as happy and entertained as they were (hopefully) enlightened. Aspiring screenwriters may find much to admire and emulate in Benton's delicate, unflinching, yet broadly accessible achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sport constantly speaks of legendary match ups, each claiming its own to be the most intense and exciting of all; Football has Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, Cricket has England vs. Australia, and not to be outdone, Tennis speaks highly of Nadal Vs Federra. But with 5 Oscars between them, Dustin Hoffmann vs. Meryl Strep for me it is the greatest match-up of them all.It was a cold winter's morning on what was the eve of the eve of Christmas, rather bored with the usual TV Christmas offerings, especially after seeing Wizard of OZ and It's a Wonderful Life for the billionth year running. I fancied a change so I decided to rent a DVD from the library. Upon arriving I was surprised to find that it was just about to close earlier than usual on account of Christmas, but as I was just about to turn around and walk back home, suddenly just pass the right shoulder of the rather pretty 20 something librarian (not at all like the stereotype) a golden halo engulfed a particular film on the top row, Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and slowly like a mouth attracted to a flame, I was sucked in. So after using my award winning charm to convince the librarian to let me in for a couple of seconds just to burrow the film, I returned home with the DVD. Then all most like a scene from a Harry Potter, it practically flew out of my arms, straight into my computer and begin playing almost by magic. What follows was an unforgettable whirlwind of a roller coaster of emotions and a sublime demonstration of actors at their very prime, who had visibly spent all most of their lives carefully developing their craft, dedicating themselves to the work and doing the best with their natural talents. Making for one of the best ensemble performances I have seen in a very long while. A screenplay written and directed by Robert Benton, based on the novel by Avery Corman centre's on the turbulent first couple of years experienced by a high flying advertising exec Dustin Hoffman, who upon receiving the greatest boost to his career yet, simultaneously has his world turned upside down, when his a wife Meryl Streep decides to walk out on me, leaving him in sole care of their 5 year old son. At first the Hoffman character finds it difficult to manage a career and a small child, which eventually means he gets fired, but soon with the help of Margaret (Jane Alexander) a friend of his wife's help, he becomes better accustomed with the father role, which turns out that he is actually quite good at. But just when his relationship with the boy grows increasingly stronger, the mother returns 18 months later and drops another bombshell on him as well as myself, when she files for exclusive custody. What follows is a long painful struggle for a boy they both deeply care about and love. The film itself earned Robert Benton an Oscar for Best Director and Adapted screenplay, but his existence and triumph. From a technical perspective, the film was near perfect never a note out of place. But rightly or wrongly he is almost completely sidetracked by the mammoth performance of the two leads Dustin and Meryl. Although retrospectively looking back it shouldn't have been of much a surprise when you take into account both actors film CV's. With 5 Oscars between them, both are very impressive, just Dustin alone (Aka the king of the 70's) has appeared in a whole host of critically acclaimed masterpieces, among them are; Midnight Cowboy (My personal favourite) Rain Man (his Oscar winner) and Straw Dogs (His most underrated film). Then you have Meryl with; Deer Hunter (My favourite war film), Out of Africa (my favourite Meryl performance outside of Kramer vs. Kramer) and Sophie's Choice. What I loved most about her performance here was her ability to draw empathy from the audience, even when her characters actions in the hands of another actress, would make her extremely unlikable person. Yet Meryl even from the start when we see her in the close up, with all the love and affection in her eyes as she looks down to her child, you can tell the decision to leave was extremely difficult, even brave. While Dustin also showcased a controlled performance, in a place where less experience actors would have overdone it, with the Oscars in mind, Dustin's only focus was to portray such a complex character as honestly as he could, and do the source material justice, but most importantly he gave a very giving performance to anyone with the pleasure of sharing the screen with him, allowing himself as well as them to shine. Kramer vs. Kramer is a stunning demonstration of fine acting talent, and would serve any aspiring young actor or actress as a seminal manual in the acting craft at its very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs Kramer is a powerful and believable drama. It certainly passes the acid test that a good work of art needs to pass: "the willing suspension of disbelief". I really appreciate how this film has no negative characters. In fact, the characters aren't even grey. The film's narration is in no way biased towards either mother or father who are fighting for their seven year old son's custody. I regard that as a big plus, the ability to present in front of the audience a story bereft of any prejudice. The father-son relationship is the chief highlight of this film, it's great to see it evolve so beautifully. When father and son set out to strengthen their bond around the film's start, they do so with trying out their hands at cooking some French toast. Their shoddy preparation doesn't lead them to getting any French toast cooked. Towards the film's end, there is another French toast scene. However, by now, they've mastered the recipe and become a wonderful team together. I'll always think of that scene when I think of this film.</fullReview>

People are like volcanoes.The more lava is trapped inside them,the bigger the explosion...That's was exactly the case of Joanna Kramer..A mother and wife who was trapped inside her husband's routine,until she couldn't take anymore. On the other hand,the case of Ted Kramer,a workaholic father who forgets that family is above all,gives a great life lesson. You have to struggle for what you love. The more you struggle,the more you will have to overcome difficulties.Ted had to learn how to live and communicate with his son,who finally became the one and only person in his life. The one he knew it was worthy fighting for...Totally one realistic,moving and must-see movie. Bonus: The park scene,when Billy meets his mother again. Lovely scenery...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but it's still a very good piece of film.In 1970s, the idea of parenthood was very different. One impressive thing about this film is that, in the end, you felt like both parents had their chance to express their point of view. In the end, it didn't take any sides, and it felt like the justice was served. I switched so many opinions during this film. I went from being on his side to being on hers and back and forth, again and again. That's why the courtroom scene was done so masterfully. There wasn't a hero and a villain. There were two real people with real problems. Joanna's courtroom monologue was written so well by Meryl Streep herself and it was the best thing that happened to this movie. It shines a whole new light on her initial escape. After that monologue, the only side I took is the kid's side. Speaking of Justin Henry, this has to be one the best performances by a kid actor that have ever existed. His bond with Dustin Hoffman is mesmerizing. Also, the fact that he's the most adorable kid you've ever seen sure helps with the sympathy for feel for him throughout the whole movie. Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman are, as always, brilliant. I felt the casting was perfect. Dustin Hoffman can go from being the most annoying person on the planet to being the most lovable. Streep's isn't on screen nearly as much, but she stole the show.Different times may make this movie seem less important than it actually was on its initial release, but they don't make it any less touching. A wonderfully done film and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What strikes is the impeccable acting of Dustin Hoffman in the role of the father and the incredibly natural young Justin Henry (Billy), largely contributing to the quality of this feature. A lot of people rave about Meryl Streep's performance when she isn't very present and has only a good scene at the courthouse... and that's it.As for the scenario, the story is quite banal ? maybe less at the time ? but very accurate: the situations, the dialogues ring true which is already remarkable. But the movie suffers from a badly structured plot: the story is set too quickly with no proper pre-split introduction which among others biases the viewer's judgement on Joana; then, the first part seems a bit too long and sometimes not enough dynamic whereas the legal outcome is expeditious. There is also a certain coldness towards the characters, to whom you hardly get attached to despite some very touching scenes.One can also regret the cinematography a bit too academic, with no big flaw but no particular cachet, which emphasizes a bit more the convenient aspect of the movie, still good but from which no real power emerges.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some terrific performances....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrific film and I am a bit torn about whether to give it a 9 or a 10. The film isn't perfect. The cooking breakfast scene, for example, is way overdone (no father is THAT inept). But, the film does pack a HUGE emotional wallop and it is bound to leave most viewers in tears--and not in a cloying and manipulative way. So, I'll err on the side of 10--especially since the film has some terrific performances.I won't review the film or what it's about, as there are already a ton of reviews and comments on IMDb about the film and the subject matter it brings up. Now this isn't to mean I don't love this aspect of the film--I adore how the film pushes for social change in regard to paternal custody. What I'd instead like to discuss is the acting. The film earned an Oscar for Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor) and Meryl Streep (Best Actress) and the boy (Justin Henry) earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Hoffman was great. He showed a wonderful range in his acting--much greater than usual for a guy in a film. As for Streep, every moment she was in the film she was excellent, though I was surprised she got the Oscar for Best Actress since she really wasn't in the film that much. But, the one that REALLY impressed me was Henry--who just blew me away with his natural acting and emotionality. The kid was simply amazing and so real--it's a shame the Academy really won't give the Oscar to kids (though they sure will nominate them).Overall, a wonderful film but one you MUST watch with some Kleenex nearby. It sure packs an emotional wallop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) **** (out of 4) A workaholic father (Dustin Hoffman) has the rug pulled out from under him when his wife (Meryl Streep) informs him that she's leaving and not taking their 7-year-old son (Justin Henry) with her. KRAMER VS. KRAMER ended up winning five Oscars including Picture, Director, Screenplay as well as awards for both Hoffman and Streep and it's pretty hard to argue and say they didn't deserve it. I've always been very fond of this movie for its frankness on the subject and because of the terrific performances but watching it for the first time since having my own son it really gives one a better appreciation of the material. I say this because the first hour of the film is pretty much a fun movie about a father trying to handle both work as well as both sides of the family. I thought Hoffman was most effective because the screenplay let the character be something real and not just one of those fake characters that often turn up in lesser quality movies. The character is far from flawless as we see his many faults but the entire time you feel as if you're watching something real. The relationship between the father and son has some down moments but it's all just so realistic. I thought the final thirty-minutes once the Streep characters enters the picture again were incredibly depressing and this here is something that really hit home now that I'm older. What makes the film so memorable are the performances as Hoffman has never gotten the credit he deserves even though he has two Oscars. It seems he's often overlooked by DeNiro, Pacino, Nicholson and the other heavy hitters of this terrific group but Hoffman has always been so great in so many different type of roles. I thought the mental stress of the situation is what he really nailed and this is perfectly scene in the first morning that he takes over the role of mommy. Streep is also incredibly powerful and it's easy to see at this early stage of her career that she was something special. Hoffman and Streep are expected to be great but what's so special is how well Henry does as the child. Howard Duff, George Coe, Jane Alexander and JoBeth Williams are also extremely good in their parts. KRAMER VS. KRAMER is certainly one of the last powerhouse movies of the decade and it's also one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divorce And Self-Actualization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is a dramatic film adapted from the novel by Avery Corman.The film stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep together with Justin Henry and Jane Alexander.It tells the story of a married couple's divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son.It was written and directed by Robert Benton.Manhattan housewife Joanna Kramer walks out on her workaholic ad man husband Ted.She leaves him their young son Billy in Ted's less than capable hands. Through trial and error, Ted learns how to take care of Billy, devoting more energy to his family than to his work.Finally he loses his high-powered job because of his new priorities. When Joanna returns with her own lucrative job and the intent to take custody of Billy, Ted finds employment that won't interfere with his paternal duties.Even though he proves that he can do it all, Joanna still wins in court.However, Joanna rethinks her desires when she finally grasps how close father and son have become.Addressing the male side of the self-actualization question, previously explored from the female perspective in movies as An Unmarried Woman, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,and The Turning Point,the film focuses on father's evolution from absent parent to ideal father especially when he learns to balance domestic and professional lives. Joanna's attempt to achieve the same, however, gets buried.Only Streep's sensitive performance prevents Joanna from seeming an unsympathetic housewife.Aside from her,Hoffman was also commendable.They both deserve the Oscar they received for this film.Finally,the realistic depiction of Ted's travails praiseworthy together with the issues concerning divorce and self-realization.This film manages to be a thought provoking movie about the issues mentioned and it resists the urge to take sides or give easy answers which makes it worthy as well as the Best Picture on the year it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Realistic Drama With An Unorthodox Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so here's what happened to me...I was sitting in my chair at home, all alone, and on netflix, wanting to watch some sort of drama that I knew I would love. I had watched "The Graduate" the previous night, so I didn't mind watching yet another Dustin Hoffman movie. I had absolutely no prior knowledge of the plot nor the theme of the movie. I chose it simply because it had Dustin Hoffman in it. After starting the movie, I was in for one of the biggest movie shocks of my life. Not because it was better or worse than I had expected, but because I could relate to it. My parents got divorced, and although divorce can be a terrible thing, there was no happy ending to the story of my parents divorcing and leaving my brother and I to figure out what to think and how to feel about such a sudden and deliberate act of irresponsibility and above all, confusion. My mom was asleep in the couch, but because she is such a heavy sleeper, I knew I would be able to watch "Kramer vs Kramer" without her watching it with me. I was wrong. She woke up towards the beginning and immediately said "Kramer vs Kramer?".... she knew what I was watching. I watched it with her, but we didn't look at each other until the very end, and then she left. I would give this movie a 10 due to the connectivity I had with it, but I must give it an 8 due to an issue I had with the plot: the ending. The movie was great, the plot was great, the situation was unbelievably realistic, but the ending was not. More often than not, divorce does not end well. There will always be problems, and the child (or children) will never be completely happy. It was total Deus ex Machina. I don't know what to say? I mean, first Mrs. Kramer leaves, goes to California, sees a whole bunch of people, and 18 months later she comes back and demands custody? Then she basically says "oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that my son is happy living with his father, who is a great parent." Then she decides to let her son live with the father after spending thousands of dollars in lawyer fees? I hate to sound rude or anything, but even if she did realize that her son would be better off living with his father, I wouldn't pay a lawyer $15,000 and then walk out of that apartment empty handed. You have to realize that people who get divorced lose all rationality and the ability to reason, because if they had it in the first place, they would never have gotten a divorce. You don't just leave your child and then say "oh, I love my child, can I have him/her back please?" All in all, the ending was exactly how it should have turned out, but it reality, it doesn't. I only like this movie because it gives me hope to think that people will watch this and realize that divorce is not a pretty thing, and even if divorce is the only way, you can at least cope with it and do what's best for everyone, and not what's best for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer vs Kramer review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970's saw a 40 percent increase in divorce rates. By 1980 the divorce rates had reached their peak. 1979 was a year that would see some of the highest divorce rates in American history. Based on the 1977 Avery Corman novel Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a single father who must challenge his ex-wife for custody of their son. Winner of five Oscars in 1979 Kramer vs Kramer is a beautifully filmed and acted melodrama. Dustin Hoffman emotes Ted Kramer so naturally it's hard to believe he isn't a real person. Meryl Streep does a flawless job at depicting an emotionally conflicted, yet sincere individual who is struggling with who she is and what she wants. Kramer vs Kramer does not exploit its characters for pathos. Instead the film explores some of the raw emotions associated with divorce. Both the father and the mother are likable characters, and although the film endeavors you to relate with the father it is hard to dislike the equally sympathetic mother. The storyline so earnestly portrays all of its characters that no one is misrepresented, and this adds gravity to the situation and creates a tone of lucid melancholy over the circumstances instead of espousing a particular view point. While the film does make some mild social commentary the exposition seems appropriate for the time period as opposed to forced and trite.Kramer vs Kramer is emotional, but not sappy. A challenge to gender roles that lacks preachy or sophomoric assertions. It is both human and sympathetic without pandering to sentimentality; because Kramer vs Kramer opts to confront its audience with a direct story about love, loss, and family without pulling any underhanded punches it is one of the most honest, and heart wrenching accounts of divorce on film.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something about Kramer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is an incredibly acted and sensitive family drama. Released in 1979, I can see this topic and subject matter being more controversial then, and now there's really nothing much about it that's really out of the ordinary. Instead, it's a great film because it's superbly written and directed as well. It's not emotionally manipulative, or either soapy or over-the-top. It's easy to care for all of these characters. The cast is great, but am even very surprised to see Henry and Alexander get Oscar nods. Hoffman really provides an emotional arc for us, and yet the film took the smart road and didn't present any one side as being the right one. Still, this is Streep's film all over. At first she portrays a certain vulnerability that is really unpredictable in terms of how much we can sympathize with her. I wasn't so sure if I should like her enough, or if I should dislike her. As the film goes on though, and the courtroom scenes take place we are put in the middle of all of the different ways that these two people feel and hurt towards their past. Because we can see more of where Joanna Kramer comes from, we do feel more for her, and Streep is a large part of this. She approaches this role with a unique sensitivity and subtlety that is hard to pull off. Her pain and hurt come from truthful places and even when her side is on the "attack" we see the different layers of characterization that she adds with her face... how much this man does mean to her and how important the past really is.Overall, I liked this more than I expected, but I can certainly see why it may feel a bit "dated". Still, it's a great film with an incredibly layered and powerful performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...I cried my eyes out....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Kramer vs Kramer for the first time. It's been years since I cried that much just from watching a movie. I haven't quite been through a divorce or legal custody battle myself but I do have a 4 yr old daughter and went through a 9th month period where the father of my child left us, so I totally relate to the emotions portrayed in the movie. In a situation like that, for me, the person who I felt the most for and just broke my heart apart to watch, was the little boy but that's not to take away from the obvious that it's just so emotionally exhausting for the parents as well in a situation like that.The performances by all the cast was stellar with exceptional recognition to Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman and the Little boy (not sure what his real name is). Such well deserved Oscars for Meryl and Dustin, it would have been great if the little boy had won was well as he was also nominated (and at only 8 yrs).Even though I cried a lot, (and you probably will too) I would recommend this movie for everyone.It is one of those timeless classics that is just as much relevant and relate able to today as when it was first made, and probably in 50 - 100 years still. I will be watching this again soon, its really just that good!!! If you haven't seen it, you really should! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very special film, even all these years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, beautifully acted film about the meanings of love, friendship, and above all parenthood. This is the film where Robert Benton's complex humanism really comes to full flower. In a situation that almost demands taking sides ? a sudden divorce leading to an unprepared father taking over childcare only to be challenged for custody when the mother returns 18 months later ? Benton manages to make everyone a complex human being, with strengths and weaknesses, trying their best to do the right thing in a painful, messy situation. Hoffman, who has been brilliant so many times playing characters far from himself is perhaps the most moving he's ever been playing a character that director Benton described as really, honestly playing himself ? perhaps the hardest character of all. Streep takes a woman who could have easily come off as the villain of the piece, and makes you understand her actions - - even abandoning her little boy. Jane Alexander is wonderful and subtle as the slowly developing friend Hoffman makes as a single father, and young Justin Henry is utterly real in a way few child actors are as the 7 year old stuck in the middle. It's also beautifully, if understatedly shot by Nestor Almendros. It's flaws are minor. Some of the supporting roles, while played by terrific character actors, are a bit more one note and characturish than they need be. And some of the courtroom theatrics feel just a tiny bit? well, theatrical. Also, there's a logic point that's always bugged me ? why doesn't Hoffman ? doing quite well on Madison Avenue, hire a part-time housekeeper or nanny to help him from becoming terminally overloaded by the combination of career and single parenthood? Last family politics have changed enough in 31 years that no longer would the climactic court fight stack up quite the same way ? it's no longer a rarity for a man to want custody of his children - but that's not a flaw in the film, just a welcome reminder that some things do get better.And none of the above are enough to detract from the fact that this is storytelling and acting of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This started as a movie that I had no desire to watch. But mostly out of curiosity after talking to my mom about it I rented it. And I'm glad that I did. This movie is wonderfully great! Though I would have given the academy award to Jane Alexander other than Meryl Streep the whole cast was great. I'm so glad that Dustin did the movie. His Oscar was very well deserved. I don't come from a broken home, but still the movie plays to my heart strings. I'm glad that the movie ended with the parent that he should have been with. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again and never tire of. It's a movie that no matter how many times you've seen it the emotions it draws from you are the same. It's a movie that is wonderfully great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer, Kramer and Kramer ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To a certain extent, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a fitting title. Its merit is to define with a powerful clarity the conflict between Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep) Kramer who have less in common the last name, than a sincere a profound love for their son, Billy (Justin Henry), both the victim of their divorce and the hostage of their fight for custody.But after several viewings, I find something subtly (and maybe deliberately) misleading in the way the title reduces the story to the trial while it's only the conclusion of a long learning and understanding process, from both sides. Yes, it's easier to root for Ted, as he's the one left by Joanna and jeopardizes his career to take care of Billy and Joanna's screen time isn't enough to bring more insights about the emotional crisis that lead her to leave her son.But the film doesn't ask for a bias, it respects the intelligence of the viewer enough to understand that if the story focused on Joanna, and took time to show what kind of husband and father Ted used to be, she might have gotten more support. But Robert Benton's thought-provoking Oscar winning script, invites us to understand the side we're not standing for, in a quest for the truth, which is so complex it can't be one-sided. This is the most compelling power of courtroom dramas: to tell the truth, the whole truth, the only truth, yet it's so underused as most movie trials rely on an innocent vs. guilty basis, and the point is just to determine if the verdict will be fair.Joanna abandoned her home, renounced to her duty as a mother, in a sort of desperate existential impulse, then came back to ask for custody. Ted, while not the perfect father took care of Billy with what was at hands, and the whole film is about his learning of becoming a good parent. It's hard to believe this is not an open-and-shut case, but this is why I mentioned courtroom dramas with uncertain truths: take "12 Angry Men", it's never about getting certitude but more about getting closer to a more reasonable approach, deprived from any emotional or sentimental bias.The bias toward Ted is reinforced through something clearly mentally unstable in Joanna's behavior, yet Meryl Streep's extraordinary performance brings a three-dimensional aspect to a mother, from the very first frames, make it absolutely impossible to believe she doesn't love Billy, or she is not a good mother. strong enough to understand the threat her mental state would have caused for her kid. Ted questioned the courage of Joanna for such a 'selfish' act, but he deliberately denies her desperateness. She felt she wouldn't be a good mother as long as her mind would be polluted by her hostility against Ted. Objectively, we can consider Joanna's act as necessary but immature.But Ted isn't a model of maturity either and his relationship with Billy indirectly highlights what kind of man he was. And it takes more than fidelity, than a job, to be a good father. Ted's mistake was basically to take many things for granted and wasted the most precious time of his life, trying to earn it. The point is not to judge if he's right or wrong but he clearly appears like a workaholic incapable to dedicate a time for anything but his work. In the first confrontation with Joanna, he's so blinded by his promotion he can't hear her telling she's leaving. When he faces the sad reality, he denies his responsibilities.And the collateral damage of these immature attitudes is Billy, the heart of the story. The movie realistically depicts the struggle between a father and a kid to reconstruct a relationship, and Robert Benton's direction admirably depicts the evolution through three important stages: denial, anger and acceptance. Ted denies his part of responsibility, blames Margaret (Jane Alexander), the recently divorced friend who probably brainwashed Joanna with her feminist ideas and he even promises his boss that he wouldn't let this situation interfere with his job. Both Ted and Billy act as if it was a temporary situation.After the first letter confirming that Mommy will never be back (hence Ted's immediate decision to remove every trace of her presence), the anger can be perceptible as both understand they'll have to endure each other. And this state of anger escalates until the emotional highlight of the film, and its defining moment with the "I hate you" scene is the pinnacle of Ted's nightmare, and probably the only way he and Billy found to exorcise their fears and anguish, because after that, they understand that it's time to learn about living together. And Ted learns to become a part like Joanna used to be, a reality highlighted by his new friendship with Margaret."Kramer vs. Kramer" is about two persons progressively understanding each other, after a reversal of roles. Joanna allows herself to be selfish, and enjoy a sort of freedom, to understand that this feeling would be worthless without the beautiful experience of motherhood. And Ted, for once, faced selfishness and learned about caring, about being patient, about struggling, in other words, becoming a good parent. Never patronizing, the movie depicts with an extraordinary realism, served by close to perfect performance, the documentary-like reality of divorce (three simple breakfast-making scenes illustrate the evolution of the father and son's cohabitation)"Kramer vs. Kramer" is the coming-of-realization story of two persons; trying to improve themselves in the name of their love for Billy and in fact, the love between them. And as there's no love without recognition, empathy and sacrifice, the film conclude with two decisions from both Ted and Joanna, so generous, that whatever their flaws were, the two Kramers are finally redeemed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing and thoughtful drama with one glaring flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually do not much care for mundane cup-of-coffee dramas revolving around such realistic developments as custody trials or divorces or wills, but even I must admit to a good deal of success achieved by Kramer vs. Kramer.Dustin Hoffman is the male Kramer, a driven career man who is very much of the school that the man goes to work and concerns himself with bringing home the bacon, while the little lady sits at home and does the housework and rears the child. When his wife, played by Meryl Streep, decides this is too suffocating an existence for her, she bolts. This leaves Hoffman with the onus of balancing his work with trying to raise a young boy (Justin Henry) that he barely knows. Once the two bond in the absence of Streep, she returns to sue for custody of the boy and the film delves into a protracted court battle as to who would be the better parent.There is nothing especially surprising in Kramer vs. Kramer, but it is the execution that brings it together. Director Benton knows how to present everything in a matter-of-fact fashion with enough emotional impact to ring true with the viewer. And while the film maintains enough of an aloofness that fails to wring all of the drama out of the material it could, it certainly does engage the viewer and elicit our sympathy for the main characters.Hoffman is quite good in a no-nonsense performance as the man who evolves from driven career guy to loving father figure. Henry is solid, but I think granting him an Oscar nomination was pushing it. Ditto, Meryl Streep. I love Streep as an actress, but I think it is unfortunate that her two Oscars were awarded so early in her career before we really got to see the kind of range she was capable of. Her Oscar for this film is indeed puzzling as Joanna Kramer functions as little more than a plot device. She is included to cause the crisis that starts the melodrama and brings the father and son together, and then returns at an appropriate moment to cause crisis number two in the guise of the custody trial. Watching Streep in this film now, one is amazed that she comes off as so flat and emotionless - even in scenes with her son. This performance fails to hint at the kind of acting legend that she would deservedly become in a few years time and the Oscar thus seems wasted on her here. By contrast, Jane Alexander makes a much more believable contender as a concerned neighbor, who initially chides Hoffman for his selfishness before ultimately becoming one of his defenders. It is a very well done and nicely layered performance.The film also brings up the canard of a legal system that favors the mother over the father without any justification, but it fails to mention that there were/are many states that favor the father over the mother. As a child of divorce myself, I was consistently confounded by a Maryland legal system that constantly gave special treatment to a father who was a violent alcoholic, but seemed to feel that a mother who had none of those issues was second class. Yet KvK often fails to mention that there are places where the pendulum swings in the other direction and somehow makes it seem that only mothers get preferential treatment.Additionally, it becomes a bit annoying that the film wants to deify Hoffman for balancing work and child-rearing like it is some sort of impossible miracle, but fails to mention that there are tons of single parents, especially women, that were doing what he does in this film for years previously without any glorification whatsoever. Really, what choice did Hoffman's character have in light of the events? Much like the legal system it derides, the film often stacks the deck in favor of Hoffman's dad and barely averts making mom Streep into some kind of one-dimensional villain. The final moments of the film avoid such a development with a not entirely convincing about-face on the part of her character, but prior to that Mom is really little more than a forgotten contrivance who enters and exits the action based solely on how it will impact the central father/son pairing. There is something just a tad irritating about that.Yet even with that rather glaring flaw, it is impossible to deny that KvK does succeed in its modest goals thanks in large part to Benton's assured director, and heartfelt performances from Hoffman and Alexander.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that shows a beautiful relationship an adjusting father has with his son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" starts with Joanna leaving her husband, Ted. Not only does she leave Ted to tend to the house by himself, but she also leaves their young son, Billy, with him. Ted has absolutely no idea what to do or how to take care of Billy, since all he knows is work. However, as time passes, his fathering skills slowly blossom and the audience is escorted into watching the beautiful relationship a newly-divorced (and still adjusting) father has with his son.This was a well-done movie when it comes to what it wanted to portray. The actors were great and very fitting for the roles, the slow progression of the relationship between Ted and Billy was realistic, and all the emotions in the movie was conveyed to the audience brilliantly. I did not however feel like this one deserved a perfect score, even if it did touch me. Hm.While "Kramer vs. Kramer" is not the best movie out there, I think that it is one of the best movies portraying child custody battles between parents. I think that anyone who watched this movie could see that what happened in this film was a hard and difficult process emotionally for both parties and the child. My parents are separated, so I found that I could relate with it. It made me curious of what happened between my parents exactly.Viewed on: May 7, 2011</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Drama With Exceptional Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I've decided to watch what are considered to be some of the best movies ever made that, for whatever reason, I've never seen before. The first movie on my list was Kramer vs. Kramer. And I wasn't disappointed. This is a powerful film with some of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. There have been some that have suggested that because this movie is dated a bit (go figure...as time goes on movies get older) it's lost some of its luster. However, I think that the fact KVK is over thirty years old actually makes it more compelling and intriguing, not less. This was the time of no cell phones, no texting, no personal computers (for the most part), no email, and no social networking sites. When one didn't have custody of their child it was letters and land line phone calls only when the child was with the other parent. When you take that into consideration, it makes the film all the more powerful as far as I'm concerned. And the acting, as has already been mentioned, was phenomenal. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep give everything they have to their performances, and thus portray their characters in such realistic fashion that it wasn't difficult for me at all to imagine that these were real people living in the real world. And I liked the fact that the makers of the film showed no bias towards either Kramer. They were both very vulnerable and imperfect people who loved their son very much. Some might think that the conclusion of the film was a cop out and that's understandable. The "happy" ending did feel a bit out of place for a film that was otherwise pretty somber. However, if one thinks about it, it wasn't really a happy ending. At least not in the conventional sense. Despite the fact that Meryl Streep's character decides not to take custody of the boy after she wins in court, there is still a road behind the Kramers (and, no doubt in front of as well) that is littered with heartbreak and sorrow. A mother who won't get to be with her son as much as she wants to be. A father who will still have to raise his son in the absence of a mother. And a boy who is caught in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart-warming tale of man and child caught in a custody battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched many movies and shows on TV that deal with divorce, but none as realistically and wonderfully as 'Kramer vs Kramer'. Led by Oscar-winners Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Meryl Streep (Best Actress in a Supporting Role) and a wonderful 8-year old Justin Henry, the movie deals with the difficulties faced by a family split by divorce.Once the basic outlines are revealed, the movie progresses to a touching story of a father who must manage his son on top of his usually busy work-schedule. As he struggles through this burden, he also learns that there is no substitute for the love of a child. He in turn becomes a competent father till things take a turn for the worst. How he handles this situation is admirable.In the golden decade for movies, 'Kramer vs Kramer' definitely doesn't compare to the likes of titles like 'The Godfather (Parts I and II)', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Sting', but is a classic in its own right, thanks to a brilliant script, sensational acting and wonderful scenes that will move you to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I will admit that this movie is pretty much dated (themes, camera work, etc.), it is still a marvelous movie. Dustin Hoffman gives a terrific performance and deserved the Oscar he received as best actor as a career-driven advertising exec whose wife (Meryl Streep) all of a sudden walks out on him and his son, leaving them to fend for themselves. The problem is that with Hoffman, work and career have always come first, and he hardly knows his son. He hardly has any housekeeping skills (as demonstrated by a hilarious french toast scene at the beginning), but things progress. He gradually becomes a better father. By the time the mother returns and decides she wants the kid back, they have bonded so much that he fights her for custody. The courtroom scene is memorable, as is the entire movie. It deserved every Oscar it got (picture, actor, supporting actress, etc.) as well as the terrific review by Leonard Maltin. Other memorable scenes include when Hoffman rushes the kid to the hospital and the bedroom scene. I guarantee you will love this movie-a must see! *** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer Vs. Kramer review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films themes are both very common, very believable despite some being very morally contradicting. Its obvious most children prefer to be with their mothers rather than their fathers, mainly because since the mother applies the more nurturing and more comforting form of parental expression. I'm not saying that Fathers can't have the skills to properly raise a child, Hell I believe sex shouldn't be an issue at all. In this well directed, and no doubt tremendously orchestrated film adapt ion of the novel, Dustin Hoffman as Ted Kramer, proves with both determination, and surprising persistence that the love he has for his son Billy (Henry), playing both Mommy and Daddy at the wake of marital abandonment. Joanna Kramer (Streep) like any mother, faces the questionable doubt of her abilities to properly raise her child, resulting in her retreat from parenthood, leaving her son and husband. She can't be characterized as an irresponsible parent, but more insecure than others, leaving her child of neither selfish, nor irresponsible judgment, but rather the knowledge of her flaws, thus causing her to run away from further expressing those flaws. She gives Ted the typical nonjudgmental answers of "its not you its me". She was right. Just by observing her physical expressions during the films introduction, we can see she is sort of disturbed, and very depressed, battling some sort of gripping demons. Lets not call her nutty, just not complete at the moment. You'd think a guy as committed to his work, and his outside life as creative art director, Ted would have very little to bring to the table. The truth is he did at first. But in the course of the films slightly determinable time span, the very clear and meaningful efforts he makes to raise his son, prove just how good of a father he is. He teaches the kid to ride a bike. He has breakfast, and dinner with kid, conversing humorously with him as they make it together, and he ran to the hospital, like a madman at the very sight of seeing his kid injured. In the course of his journey of ascending to true parenthood, of which he lacked in the beginning, probably in the views of Joanna's close friend Margaret (Alexander), Ted's life becomes more and more complicated, as his responsibilities with raising a child on his own, conflict with the opinions of his superiors at work. In the 15 months since his wife left him, Kramer's performance at work has given less confidence to his boss John Shaunessy (Duff) and more incentive for his termination, with a little sense of respect. The whole taking them out to lunch, and then firing them method, seems both lacking in any respect and dignity for both parties, posing a big problem for Ted, because Joanna is back and wants Billy. I definitely thought of Joanna as a complete hypocrite. It was nice that she actually got herself some therapy, and worked out her issues, only to reclaim her son like a shamelessly depressing excuse for a parent. In the wake of her return, the film's title "Kramer vs. Kramer" becomes real, as the 2 parents battle out in court, and with the tension of knowing in the end, whoever loses, the result could be devastating to Billy. The Lawyers for each party were pretty vicious as well, each launching a barrage of tough and almost infuriating questions. On one side we Ted's lawyer asking Joanna questions referring to her general mother hood, as well as her motivations for leaving in the first place. On the other side, we have Joanna's lawyer questioning, Ted's old, and even his currently small, but well manipulated flaws to his advantage. I'm sure plenty of viewers felt relived when Ted's selfless determination to keep his child got him a good job just in time for court, only for the hopes of Billy and Ted being together to be shot down at the mercy of Joanna's higher salary. When all is said and done, the case result's becomes obvious, and the judge goes for the typical motherhood BS I brought up earlier. To even my surprise, Joanna's conscience causes a change of heart, to give full custody to her ex. Despite the films touching message, and reasonable direction, Streep's opposing character having a hypocritical motivation of fighting for her son, one cannot but be amazed by her performance, and how it just captures the very insecurities, and her self doubts as a mother. You can just see it in the way she speaks so shy and nervous towards anyone. Hoffman on the other hand, captures his character with plain and simple, but still very inspirational moral responsibility. In the course of the film, he was father with general love with his child, and when placed in the position of being both parents to Billy, his understanding of his son's love for his mother pushed him to try harder. His character development was very basic, but believable, which it should be. I myself have been raised by a great mother who has had to play both parts. The film's direction doesn't over dramatize Hoffman's development from a workaholic bread winner to workaholic/ loving father. Billy in general, was reason enough for his improvement. "Kramer vs. Kramer" displays more than just a courtroom battle for a child, as it also sends a message of what is truly right for a child, and that the sex of the parent doesn't matter. All the matters is the concept of love, and the actions that parent, mother or father, takes to show that child.</fullReview>

When he wake up in the morning and asks where his mother is, what would you do? You lead a busy work-schedule and it is impossible to balance your job with looking after your son. And yet you need to work in order to put food on the table.This is the dilemma of the film. This excellent man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), advertising executive is just given his agency's biggest new account. After spending the evening chatting with his boss about handling a new and very large account, he returns home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) in the process of leaving him.Ted is left to raise their son Billy (Justin Henry) by himself. Ted and Billy begin to resent each other as Ted no longer has time to carry his increased workload, and Billy misses the love and attention he received from his mother. After many months of unrest, Ted and Billy begin to cope with the situation and eventually grow to love and care for one another.Then we find the most controversial part of the film: the battle for custody of Billy. It seems to me SHAMEFUL when two adults fight over custody their child.Finally, the court awards custody to Joanna, not so much due to the evidence on both sides but due to the assumption that a child is best raised by his mother. Ted discusses appealing the case, but his lawyer warns that Billy himself would have to take the stand in the resulting trial and Ted cannot bear the thought of submitting his child to such an ordeal. He therefore decides not to contest custody.On the morning that Billy is to move in with Joanna, Ted and Billy make breakfast together, mirroring the meal that Ted tried to cook the first morning after Joanna left. They hug in a very tender moment as they both know this is their last breakfast together. Joanna calls from the ground floor, asking Ted to come down to talk. She tells Ted that, while she loves Billy and wants him with her, she knows that he is already home, and that his true home is with Ted. She will therefore not take him. As she enters the elevator, she asks her ex-husband "How do I look?". The movie ends with the elevator doors closing on the emotional Joanna, right after Ted answers, "You look terrific," as she heads upstairs to talk to Billy.Every cloud has a silver lining. Ted fought for the love of his son and WON. In conclusion: LOVE ALWAYS WINS IN THE END.Excellent acting by all actors involved. During the filming Dustin Hoffman actually bonded with Justin Henry and he stated that he looked upon Justin as his very own son. Meryl Streep has a small role in the film but she is effective in the character she portrays of a frustrated woman who sees no worth in the life of a housewife.An excellent film to watch with your family. Just go out there and BUY it.Email me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movies lists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could watch this movie a million times and never get bored because everything is so real. The acting is flawless; so flawless that it doesn't even appear that they are acting. Dustin Hoffman is simply a joy in this movie. He's superb, and the love that grows between him (Ted) and his son (Billy) is so moving and sincere. It's just as powerful, if not more, than any romantic storyline out there in the movies. This is love. A love between a boy and his father. It's deep love. The type of man which Ted grows to be is a beautiful human being, and this is all due to love. He becomes a perfect role model for what a parent should be. Hoffman is excellent. The boy actor is perfect. Another reason why I like this film is because it shows that a person is capable of change, afterall. If you're moved by great actors and real story lines, then watch this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Oscar-winner is perhaps the best film about divorce and custody battle. The film does a good job of conveying the pain of divorce, although it tends to pull a bit too much at the heartstrings at times. Hoffman is terrific as a man who is so immersed in his job that he unwittingly neglects his family and pays the price. Streep does a good job in the difficult role of an unsympathetic character, a part she parlayed into stardom. The always reliable Alexander turns in another fine performance as a supportive friend. Williams has a memorable encounter with Henry, with both making their film debuts here. It is solidly directed by Benton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising class winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to show this film to my critical viewing class in the unit that deals with social changes and gender roles. I was a little apprehensive because it's a small film, with almost all dialogue and this goes against the grain of what these kids are used to. But since I'd always wanted to show a Meryl Streep film as well, it seemed like a good risk.To my complete amazement, the class LOVED it! It was only later during discussion that I realized they could relate to it because of the divorce and how it effects kids. So many of them had similar situations, including the kid who shared that his mother hadn't wanted him either, and that's why he lived with his dad (gulp!). Nobody complained that there were no special effects or violence--they were totally into the story.One unexpected side effect--they loathed Meryl Streep. Of course, it was the character they were reacting to, but it was very surprising that they were so emotionally invested they really had trouble separating the actress from her performance. I found out that most of them didn't really know her work--except for the Devil Wears Prada--and felt vaguely guilty that I'd turned off a generation to this magnificent actress. So I slipped in an extra film for fun and showed The River Wild. I wanted them to see her in a more heroic vein. Most of them liked the film very much and were able to comment on the broad contrast.Sometimes teens really surprise you. I really thought they might hate it. Instead, it's a definite film for next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>relationships within the movie are volatile but strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a phenomenal movie. Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". The passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. This is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic/vintage movie. I hope you engage with it as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. This movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. The 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Academy Award winning 'Kramer vs. Kramer' follows a snazzy businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life, forcing Ted to become closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect Ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. Ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspiring film. The film took the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you don't mind a tearjerker, 'Kramer vs. Kramer' is a great film to watch. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Provocative and Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Benton's film of single parenting, divorce, and custody battles has so much potential to become a mawkish TV Movie of the Week drama, but manages to resist the urge at every turn. Instead he has made a film that is as intelligent as it is moving and is worthy of a place on the big screen. Dustin Hoffman plays Ted Kramer a successful advertising executive who is abandoned by his wife (Streep) and is forced to look after his young son by himself. This may sound like a tedious enough scenario, but we are saved from the traumas of soap operatic drivel by Benton's sharp direction and superlative acting from the entire cast. As with so many of his performances in the seventies, Hoffman is entirely convincing and totally without flaw. He successfully portrays the character of a man who is committed to his working duties yet that has to consistently struggle in order to give his son the kind of domestic life necessary. Meryl Streep performs a similarly laudable turn as his neglected wife who walks out of the home in order to rebuild her shattered confidence. The film devotes the first hour to the depiction of Hoffman's efforts to build a better home for his son in the light of his wife's absence, and Benton's shrewd direction in this regard results in a film that is both entertaining and emotionally challenging. Hoffman bravely comes to terms with the challenges of single parenting and learns that there is more to life than making a lot of money. Justin Henry in the role of seven-year-old Billy Kramer delivers a towering performance as a child who is caught between two battling parents, and disproves the theory that child actors are both annoying and precocious. As the film progresses towards its conclusion the two warring partners take their case to court in order to decide on the custody of their child, and rather than presenting the courtroom showdown as a showpiece of crying, screaming and accusations, Benton instead delivers an intelligent commentary on the nature of responsible parenting.For a film that tackles the plethora of domestic issues which it does, Kramer Vs Kramer manages at all times to be a compelling movie which never trivialises the topics it is dealing with, nor does it ever allow itself to take a convenient moral stance regarding the conflicting parents. Instead it presents a credible, moving story of a father and son trying to build and maintain a successful relationship, while at the same time presenting the story of a mother vying for the love of her son yet trying to create a life of her own in the process. An intelligent script couple with top rate performances and sharp direction make this movie the finest in its class and remains one of the quintessential characterisations of America's divorce ridden culture. Sadly, the same could not be said for the countless spin-offs it inspired.</fullReview>

The final scene with Streep and Hoffman is simply unforgettable and superb. This film won the best actor and actress in a supporting role and of course as picture and also won for best director. This is one of those film which improves with the years. It´s simply unforgettable and excellent example of the best of the best in the movie history of the 20th century.

		<fullReview>"Kramer vs Kramer" was the best movie when I first saw it (almost 15+ years ago) and it still is. Everything in it, the acting, the photography, the cast, the background music everything was as close to perfection as any movie I've ever seen. And of course the "plot" - I've never seen anything that even comes close.It's about a Man whose wife just left him to go "find herself". It's about his career, about his marriage (that he probably took for granted) and his son.It's about a woman who has just left her husband and her son to go find herself. To figure out who she is (independent of being a wife and a mother). And it is about her son whom she loves dearly.It's about a little boy whose mother has just left him and whose father is not really prepared to be his "father" and his "mother" though his father loves him very much.But mostly it's about a man his son trying to get on with their lives without the person who had kept it all glued together. It's about the father learning to make french-toast, it's about the son learning "mommys sometime go away" even though it was nothing that he did. It's about learning that some things are more important than your career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep star as a husband and wife who go through what has to be the most easy-going divorce in film history. What little friction there is arises from the battle over custody to their young son, played amazingly well by Justin Henry. Ted and Joanna (for 'tis their names) seem completely wrong for each other, making it hard to believe that they were actually married for seven years. Judging from the interaction we see in the film, I would have given them maybe a year at most.But none of the details of their relationship really matter because the film is mainly about Ted's changing relationship with the boy, Billy. Dustin is excellent as always, smoothly fitting into the hustle-bustle life of an advertising executive, but his shift from self-absorbed to caring father is done in clearly visible steps. I never sensed that his progression was natural.Still, the scenes between Hoffman and Henry work splendidly; they capture the casual yet touching balance between father and son. The script is smart and it gives the two actors plenty of good scenes (Ted's French toast and Billy's introduction to his father's girlfriend stand out in my mind). Streep (working without an accent!) broke my heart as the stifled woman who needed to find herself.Ultimately, I liked the film because none of the characters are either black or white. As Ted himself admits in court, he isn't a perfect father. Joanna certainly isn't a perfect mother. And Billy can be a little brat. But underneath their various tensions, there is concern and a true desire to make this major change to their lives without hurting each other. Flawed yet touching, I'll give "Kramer vs. Kramer" a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer deals with an unpleasant situation (divorce, custody battle et al) in a very entertaining and dramatic manner.Dustin Hoffman,in a great performance, goes from a happy with his life husband and father, to a confused and frightened individual who must now fight for his own survival and win the custody battle over his son. Along the way he must learn to be a "mother" to his son, as well as father and to keep his career on track.Meryl Streep, just emerging as a major star in this film is excellent as the wife and little Justin Henry as the son caught in the middle brings a tear or two to the viewer's eye.Also giving excellent performances are Jane Alexander as the neighbor who befriends Hoffman and veteran Howard Duff as Hoffman's attorney.Don't miss the scene where Hoffman's girlfriend, played by Jobeth Williams (in the buff) is met on the way to the bathroom by Justin Henry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie; it's quite unusual for writers to write a screenplay in which it is the father that stays with the baby after a divorce. Very soon we have no choice but to see how good a man he is (at least with his son, since they don't show the relationship he had with his wife). Dustin Hoffman portrays that father very intensely (as with every of his characters in his career I think) and I found that Justin Henry is a fantastic kid actor.

		<shortDescription>The Love's No Longer There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by Justin Henry.What I really did like about Kramer vs. Kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. Though the film is slanted in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. He's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when Streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.Hoffman and Henry make do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody.Both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep does get less screen time than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film does focus on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. As for Meryl it's a Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than channel Spencer Tracy in his performance.Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. Don't miss it if ever broadcast.</fullReview>

This movies are not serious, and in them don't have deep trues, they take us nothing, just stupid actions and more stupid soundtracks.

		<shortDescription>A fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, this has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. In reality, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a fine drama movie, without a doubt one of the finest of its kind. I'm glad that it won more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because it deserved."Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great film, generally well made and balanced. And it stands the test of time, too. Not only it doesn't look too dated, but also its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains as significant as it was in 1979. They don't make movies like this today.This movie is depressing but it has humor as well. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or place to discuss such thing. For a movie like this, such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary.The story is interesting. The actors's chemistry is perfect. All of the actors are great, but the 3 main ones are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance ever here as Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna.The score is all Vivaldi. Simply dazzling.This motion picture has also good character development. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how though life is, with the problems in his job and the return of Joanna, who wants the custody of their son. But even Joanna changes for better.This movie has also some though things, such as courtroom scenes where both Ted and Joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers. Another though thing to see is when poor Billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and gets seriously injured on the face. But then again, the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital.Overall, this is a movie which is a good lesson of life.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film before I had a family, and I liked it well enough. Now that I have a husband and children, I see that this movie is the "Gentleman's Agreement" of divorce. ; ie., we're supposed to think that the slings and arrows he suffers are somehow worse because they're happening to someone who isn't even a mother! (Like in Gentleman's Agreement, we're supposed to think that the discrimination Gregory Peck suffers is somehow worse, because he isn't even Jewish! Oy!!)Poor Dustin has his icy wife walk out on him, and he gets left with the kid. Poor guy, he actually has to become a parent for a change, and of course his work suffers. Somehow, he copes, and we're supposed to believe that this makes him a really exceptional man. Of course he deserves custody more than the selfish wife who left (for very good reason, if I remember correctly. ).The irony is that somehow, Dustin is a special kind of person because this isn't supposed to happen to men (only women). At least he doesn't have to move out of his apartment into cheaper digs because he relied on his wife's income to maintain their standard of living.P.S. Dustin, you don't pick up your kid and run with them to the E.R. with their head dangling from your arms. I guess that's supposed to show just what a good, concerned parent you are, but moving the kid like that could have cost him the use of his eye.P.P.S. Meryl, you were entitled to take more than just the money you brought to the marriage, dearie.P.P.P.S. No, I'm not a bitter divorced mother, or planning to become one, and my husband could parent rings around Dustin's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally gets up the courage to leave him, leaving Ted to care for their five year old son (Justin Henry). Being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for Ted, and he suffers professionally but also learns there's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with, and really get to know, his own son. But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, which leads to a cruel custody trial.Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out. It always feels very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings, the film's dramatic impact does not lessen.Easily recommended; 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The film is centered around Dustin Hoffman's dedication to his child -- and the sacrifices that need to be made. It also deals with how divorce can confuse a child. This film is not manipulative nor sappy, but just honest -- almost like it was a documentary. Whether or not it was worthy of Best Picture is an other question entirely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a typical 70's product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the commentators seem to love this film. I hate it. In a world too cluttered with garbage, this is a chunk that should head straight for the incinerator. The 1970's was the decade of the baby boomer--and since I am one I think I can say without shame that shooting is too good for the principles in this cheap-shot.Director Robert Benton insists that he made the character of Joanna Kramer sympathetic and believable, and I'm assuming, in retrospect, that Meryl Streep--in this early outing--gave Benton just what he wanted. If she did, then what he wanted was far from sympathetic and believable only as a whining monster--for that is what Joanna Kramer is, a monster who wants it all, no matter what it costs anybody else in her life. I kept hoping for the deus ex machina to come in and strike her dead! Joanna is a cold, unlovable bitch and Meryl did such a good job of portraying her that it took me a long time to look at her in other roles to realize what a wonderful actress she is! Of course she has long since proved her versatility as an actress--the ghastly and unwatchable "Mamma Mia!" notwithstanding! Hoffman's performance is winning, and if the kid is a bit treacly, well, aren't they supposed to make you say "a-w-w-w-w" even as you barf? This film, obviously, is not high in my list. Everybody in the cast is better, elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer begins with the picking up of the ashes of an eight year marriage. We are left trying to assemble the broken pieces of the Kramer household in the period where we would be conventionally just being introduced and warming up to the characters. So it is a mystery, in a sense, working backwards - clues are laid out in front of us and we must try to decipher them and answer the question of why Joanna Kramer might want to walk out on her husband, but more importantly, her seven year old son. For a moment there is the suggestion that there may be a disability in play, but soon we realise that he is just another clumsy seven year old who wants ice cream instead of dinner. What Benton does here is use Joanna's absence as actual narrative. The wide swathes of the motherhood experience missing from the household tell us all that we need to know about her previous role. Billy is well-drilled; he knows exactly what brand of cereal and detergent is the best, has memorised where all the kitchen utensils are, and from rubbing of his mother's shoulders seems to be the better cook too. Ted knows none of this. He doesn't even know what grade his son is in. These early sequences of him struggling to reconcile his new duties as a father and handling a major account at his work are the easy, sentimental stuff that must inevitably occur when we are dealing with stories of parenthood. Yes, Billy may be a little brat at times, but he is also only seven, and Ted must re-learn this again and again. Until they are finally bonding, and must bide their time before it is ripped away from them. It is not so hard to get through this familiar material because Hoffman is such a natural at the role - the moment where he sees Billy wobbly take off on his bicycle and his face creases up the widest smile you have ever seen is so believable and such a relief because we too have been taken on this journey and we know the baggage that lies heavy in his heart. The early, chaotic french toast breakfast is later masterfully contrasted with another breakfast; again it is french toast, and this time they have mastered the routine, but there is a deafening silence because of what is to come, and they are trying to enjoy every last moment of it, but also trying to pretend like it isn't coming. Many have labelled this a court-room drama. I think this is the wrong tag. It comes with the assumptions that the dialogue comes thick and fast and there are pre-determined moments where we gasp and the lawyers strike dramatic poses and swap steely gazes. This is nothing as flashy and surface-level. The lawyers themselves are still snappy and ruthless. Joanna's in particular has completely rid himself of any heart and narrowed his sights on not only getting Billy back but also destroying all constructs that Ted's fatherhood might have erected. He repeatedly cuts off Margaret because he is not interested in the backstory but only getting his conviction soundbites that paint a much different story than what is really happening. No, the meat of the story is here, but it is not within the court system and the way it strips down everything to nothing but cold, hard facts and twists their intentions cruelly. As each side pleads their case both Joanna and Ted begin to realise that their battle is a fruitless one if Billy is to suffer for it, and start to turn back on their own arguments. The clear cuts and divides in the law are revealed to be not adequately equipped to handle such delicate and emotionally jumbled issues. If this wanted to fill seats it would have had young Billy himself take the stand and somehow magically see things clearer than the adults and repair the broken marriage. But he is only seven. Rarely can a film be so impartial. It asks nothing of its characters but complete honesty. Are their egos worth ripping apart the life of their young son? In the end, they make the right decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satisfied to have finally seen this film, some 37 years after it first came out. Viewing the film fills in a gap of my pop-cultural understanding at least. The content, however, is extremely dated, reflecting the fact that it is a product of its time. Not at all surprising to hear that the film was based on a reactionary, anti- feminist, quasi-misogynist novel, which is made manifest by the total subordination of Streep's Joanna to Hoffman's Ted. Don't be fooled by the false hype of two great actors going head-to-head. The very, very young Streep is hardly in the film at all, and the character Joanna's motivations are only thinly alluded to, never fully explained. This is strictly a vehicle for Hoffman to project as hot-shot advertising executive transitioning into a put-upon father. For his part, with the exception of Marathon Man and Tootsie, Hoffman never fails to remind me how much I'd really rather be watching Al Pacino in the same role. The supposedly climactic court scene is so cheesily melodramatic and utterly false. that it can only be viewed as some misogynist wet dream, complete with ridiculous shouting and badgering by conspicuously male divorce lawyers. Joanna's speech, supposedly penned in a fit of brilliance by Streep herself, is cringe-inducingly nebulous. Streep can be forgiven, she was only 27. The director/"screedwriter" Robert Benton shouldn't be let off so easily, however. In the end, this is fairly typical 70s schlock that turned out to be quite profitable. Good for the business of "movies", bad for the art of cinema. My curiosity was more killed than satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is one of these films, though I would argue that it's not aptly named, since they're not really at each other's throats the whole time, and when they are (which isn't ever as vicious as some of today's court cases), it's only during the third act of the film.The film starts off by introducing all of the principal characters. The mother, Joanna (Meryl Streep) is putting her child (Justin Henry) to bed, and Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is having a late-night talk with a co-worker. By the time he gets home, Joanna says she's leaving him and the plot is set up. What follows is a long series of scenes which show how Ted has to adjust to being a single parent, and culminates in a courtroom battle as Joanna, after a long period, fights for custody of her son. What I feel like the film does well is not paint everything as black or white. Ted isn't portrayed as a wholly perfect father, yet Joanna isn't portrayed as a villain. I will say, however, that not as much screen time is allotted to Meryl Streep so that her character's motivations come off as a bit selfish at first. Still, the meat of the story is in how her decision to leave affects her husband and child, and there was certainly a lot to process. This is a touching film that broke ground in its day and is still poignant today, the unrealistic portions not with standing.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

However, she wants to get a job actually, and decides to go somewhere alone. Suddenly, without Joanna, Ted and Billy start to live together. Ted doesn't know a lot of things like how to make French toast. Ted comes to do so many things that he has not done before. It is such a hard work for him, but they are getting closer and closer compared to before. One and a half year passes by, Joanna comes to Billy back. She decides to try a trial. How will they be in the end? The reason why I watched is my friend recommends me to watch. As my friend told me, it is worth watching, because the theme is family. We can understand the story easily, because it is related to every person. After I watch it, I come to think what the important thing it is, and if I were in the same situation as Billy, what I would think and feel. I want to recommend this to my friend too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Acted Film that withstands the Test of Time,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast all around. It's a dramatic, and at times very surreal, film that deals with the subject of divorce in the most blunt way possible, showing how a couple can simply wake up one morning and realise they don't love each other anymore, and fight for the custody of their child, it's dramatic and it never cuts corners or tries to be sweet, it's just life. The plot is very slow moving at times, which is my only real issue, while it's nice to have a slow pace that mostly consists of dialogue, there comes a time when we want the plot to develop, there's a very long period where we don't see or hear from Meryl Streep's character, and are left feeling very anxious. The performances are magnificent and this type of film couldn't have been good without that, Dustin Hoffman, one of my favourite actors, shines in this role, he could definitely relate to Ted Kramer and played him very naturally, he bottles up his emotions, which is just as powerful as crying, his scenes with his on screen son Justin Henry are the highlight of the movie, there is a real love and bond there as Hoffman is forced to become a real father figure. Meryl Streep also shines in all her scenes, she's a miserable, emotional wreck and it can be seen in every moment she is on screen. A powerfully acted and surreal masterpiece, Kramer vs. Kramer still holds up today and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. After their marriage falls apart, a couple fight for the custody of their son. Best Performance: Dustin Hoffman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling family drama with remarkable performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mommy stayed here longer than she wanted because she loves you so much. And the reason why Mommy couldn't stay anymore... was because she couldn't stand me. She didn't leave because of you. She left because of me."Robert Benton's third feature film, Kramer vs. Kramer, still stands out as his best. This 1979 family drama which explores interpersonal relationships and the effect divorce has on the family, remains very relevant in today's society. It is one of those rare classics that has managed to age very well due to its universal theme. In order for an authentic drama like this to work you need a strong script and believable actors. Kramer vs. Kramer has both, Robert Benson did an amazing job with the screenplay adaptation of Avery Corman's novel and the dialogue in the film feels authentic while avoiding any false notes. And of course you couldn't have had anyone better than Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep to play the divorced couple. Hoffman was already at the height of his career, while Streep was just getting started proving she's always been an out of this world actress. Both actors won their first Academy Awards for this film, and it wouldn't be their last. But in a film like this no matter how good the adult characters are, you need to have a child who can win over the sympathy of the audience and engage them emotionally. Benton made a huge gamble when he hired inexperienced Justin Henry for the role, but it payed off marvelously. At only 8 years old Henry was nominated for his supporting role. The scenes he shares with Hoffman are endearing and the relationship between the two is the center of the film. It was the subtle moments that the two shared together that stuck with me the most, like the scene where the kid challenges his father's authority by eating the ice cream. These were improvised scenes, but they added to the authenticity of the film. That relationship between both of them is key, as we witness the transition and evolution of Hoffman's character.The film opens with a shot of Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) packing her clothes in a suitcase while she waits for her husband, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) to return home from work so that she can break the news to him that she is leaving him. Apparently she has been unhappy for quite some time now and she wants to discover who she is. Despite being heartbroken about having to abandon her young son, Billy (Justin Henry), she is convinced she has to go. Ted, who hasn't the slightest clue about housekeeping, must now learn to manage his work while taking care of his son. During the early scenes we see what an inexperienced father he is, he can't prepare breakfast for Billy without burning everything. But as the movie progresses we begin to see the transformation that Ted goes through and what a caring father he becomes. His career does begin to suffer and he begins struggling to keep his job, but he has learned to put his son's life before his own. With the help of his friendly neighbor, Margaret (Jane Alexander), he becomes an expert at parenting, but that is around the time that Joanna returns back to the city and tells Ted she wants to take her son with him. A court battle for their son's custody ensues as neither parent refuses to live without their son. The film builds a great father and son dynamic during most of its runtime and that is what makes the courtroom drama so compelling near the end because the stakes have been settled. I don't think this film would've won the Oscar for Best Picture if it weren't for those intense scenes during the trial. The testimony each parent gives is compelling and the performances in those scenes were superb, but I actually enjoyed the quieter and more subtle moments in this film. The scenes were Hoffman is sharing some time at the park with his son or simply reading a story to him. Those were the moments that made this film ring true and authentic. I think that the film could've ended on a stronger note if it decided to have ended some five minutes before it actually did because it ties things up too neatly at the end. The final kitchen scene would've been the perfect moment to end it, but I won't complain too much because the film is compelling and the performances had me engaged from the very opening scene. Kramer vs. Kramer still resonates with audiences today and it is a great example of how to make a compelling family drama about the effect that divorce has on the family. I enjoyed every minute of it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, emotional movie. A powerful exploration of the causes and effects of divorce, and the controversial subject of child custody. Maybe not entirely balanced in its examination - very little is seen of Mrs Kramer (Meryl Streep) - and the ending is a bit trite and Hollywoodish. Superb performances. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep deserved their Oscars. Good support from Jane Alexander and Justin Henry (who, at 8 years old, became the youngest ever Oscar nominee).However, didn't deserve the 1980 Best Picture or Best Director. Those should have gone to Apocalypse Now and Francis Ford Coppola, respectively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've gotta say, in a movie that features Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep (both offering high-calibre stuff), it's Justin Henry that really leaves an indelible mark on "Kramer vs. Kramer". You conjure a certain idea when you hear what this movie's about (and that's true, those are some unpleasant divorce proceedings in the courtroom, to be sure), but there's a real emotional core to this that you just don't expect. It's not bad enough that Hoffman's been left to father his child alone, but Meryl Streep has to come back for custody. Where this movie really shines is in the scenes with Hoffman and his son (Henry), both in bonding and saying goodbye. It's a beautiful relationship. Streep gets the shaft because of this, but she's still not half-assing it.This is a brutal movie because of the pervading sense that the wound always feels fresh. And you never see the emotional hay-makers coming. But the sentiment isn't artificial, and there are no overwrought theatrics. That's what I love about this; there's genuine heart to all of it. And I defy anyone to keep from welling up during father and son's dialogue scene in the closing minutes ("You're not gonna kiss me good night anymore, are you, Dad?").8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked late 70s movies as it was the years where i was a little kid. I opened my eyes to the world at this moment and coming back to this time is always emotional for me. This movie was all the more interesting for me that it deals with parenthood so this was also the life of my parents back then. For years i heard about it for its cast and divorce fight but now that i have watched it, i realize that it's rather a pro-man movie. Indeed, Streep doesn't lack anything or suffers however she left the home on a impulse and she is really depicted as bad ! Then, Dustin proves he can be as good as her for educating their son and managing his job. So it's really a surprise and a great moment to see a movie so oriented in one point of view. I'm sure today it would be impossible to shoot it as nobody would want to be so assertive ! The dynamic classic musical piece that opens the movie is really well chosen as the movie is just like that : fast paced, emotional. The kid is really excellent and there's a good chemistry between the two guys. I think that Dustin is a great father as he really understand his son and can be as much stern as caring. He gives also a amazing lesson when pushed to his limits, he never indulges into violence. I also really liked when he wants to cry but instead offers a big smile. So it's truly a classic and i would recommend it without hesitation to my future family !</fullReview>

You actually care what happens to these people. Overall, while certain surface aspects date this film a little bit, the emotional core is very strong and the performances only make things that much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) is tired and leaves her family for California. Her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is stunned and forced to take care of their son Billy. He had been working extra hard to get an important account. He blames it on her divorced friend Margaret Phelps (Jane Alexander) but later relies on her. His boss Jim O'Connor (George Coe) urges him to send the boy away to relatives. He brings home co-worker Phyllis Bernard (JoBeth Williams) in a hilarious scene.It's a heart-warming sensitive movie coming at just the right time in the culture. Hoffman is able to portray the man with just enough selfishness without being cruel. He is then able to transition to a more sensitive father. The kid does an impressive job for a kid. It is left a little up in the air why Joanna leaves which is fine by me. I'm glad that it's not something overly dramatic. It's also important that nobody is the clearcut bad guy. It allows the movie to not go too dark. Meryl Streep does a fascinating performance as the mercurial Joanna. It was a big winner on Oscar night although 'Apocalypse Now' is my favorite of that year.</fullReview>

Well, she could have got herself a job. Yes, mother is the most important person in every child's life (especially from 3-5 years of age), but she could have paid a nanny from the earned money. Ted worked, took care of a kid, without the nanny. All alone. He managed somehow. Because he loved his son and felt responsible for him. The child doesn't come from out of nowhere, by it's own will. Father and mother are responsible for that. where was Ted when his son hit his head? HE was there! The bigger reason why Joanna left Ted was that she needed a man, meaning a lover. He neglected her cause of his work. But that need she felt was more important to her than her own child - that's where she lost every sympathy from me.

		<fullReview>Kramer vs Kramer is one of the most realistic depiction of a family being torn apart by divorce and one of the first, on film. Adapted from the novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the movie tells the story of a married couple's divorce, Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son, Billy Kramer (Justin Henry). Directed by Robert Benton, the movie reflected a cultural shift which occurred during the 1970s, when ideas about parenthood were changing. The movie serves as Hollywood's answer to many contemporary questions toward divorce. This movie forever put a great understanding about how hard it is to be divorce and raising a child. The movie is made out to be a divorce drama, but you barely get that until ? in the film. It's more about Hoffman's character, learning how to become a better father than an actual showdown between the two parents. This is one of the first film that portray a father in a more sensitivity type role. The father in the film takes more of an attachment style of parenting, when Joanna choose to live outside, the traditional role of being confined to some extent to an ideal mother and wife. You really enjoy the film for each scene in the movie, where Ted Kramer grows closer and closer to his son and takes his duties as his father, very serious. One of the most famous scene in the movie is the 'ice cream' scene that gets me every time. Dustin Hoffman really knew his role, and how rough divorce could be, because at the time of filming, he was going through a real life marriage separate with his first wife. Indeed, Dustin Hoffman deserve the Academy Award, Best Actor win for this film. The same goes to Meryl Streep for the supporting role. Joanna is not an easily appealing character, but Meryl Streep makes her likable. Meryl Streep at the time, was still recovering from the death of her lover, actor John Cazale from lung cancer. It's sad, that Meryl Streep is barely in the film. The scene with Meryl Streep in the courtroom was her Oscar breaking moment. No matter, how good, Ted Kramer can serve the mother role, in the end, it's hard for the child to break their maternal bond. Still, the "tender years" doctrine that states mothers are better parents than fathers of young children was on the wane by the late 1970s, when the film came out, thus it's unlikely a judge would still make that the sole basis of his decision. I'm really glad, that the movie gave equal weight to both parents, showing their strengths and faults. There wasn't a lot of mean-spirit arguments or fighting between them. I'm kinda glad, because it would had turn me off, from enjoying the film. It's very importance to show both Joanna and Ted's points of view, rather than one. If, they only did one, it would be, very off-putting. The movie even made me, like Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. He deserve his nomination. Unlike, many other child actors, at the time, he wasn't annoying or seem inexperienced in his acting chops. He played the role in a very maturely for a child, his young age. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff, and George Coe. The movie also make great use of classical music like Vivaldi's Concerto in C major for mandolin and strings and Henry Purcell's work. It appears over the opening credits and throughout the film. It was a joy to listen to. Made in 1979, the movie is a little dated. The story lacks substance compare to today's soap-operas. Its rating is bit questionable. The movie is rated PG, but the movie has some foul language, drug use and nudity that puzzling to see in a PG film. I guess, 1979 was a little more open, than parents of this generation. It's more PG-13, these days. It really up to the parent if they really want to show this movie to their children. I do think, children do need to understand what divorce is all about and this movie still is one of the best films that cover that issue. It has a positive message that encourages sensitivity, understanding, responsibility, and tenderness in child-parent relationships. The film gives good examples of positive ways of dealing with anger, fear and disappointment. No wonder, why this film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1980. Overall: It's a very thoughtful film. I'm glad, that I watch it. I believe kids and parents who've been through divorce will find much that is relatable and if a movie can help people dealt with it. Then I think it's a good movie. I recommended it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father becomes mother, but it won't be easy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep's Joanna is a woman past the stage of a nervous breakdown. She's had it, she's tired of just being a wife and a mother, and even just having the supposed easy life of staying home and keeping house for busy artist Dustin Hoffman has sent her into a frenzy of emotions she can't rise above. Yes, she loves her young son (Justin Henry), but that isn't enough. She gave up her career at her husband's request and according to her, thus a piece of herself. When Ted (Hoffman) comes home from a hard day's work, he's still consumed by the events of the day, and can't even hear Streep tell him that she's leaving. Oh, by the way, she adds as the elevator door closes, "I'm not in love with you anymore". So with that, an eight year marriage ends (no mention is made of how long they were together prior to getting married), and a new relationship begins for papa Ted that he didn't have before: one with his young son Billy.Ted must now learn how to get his kid ready for school, and that means making breakfast, dressing him, and finding his way there before he heads off to the cut throat world of his Manhattan job. Being late for important meetings isn't going to win him any prizes, but overnight, he must stop thinking of just his career and start thinking of what is best for his motherless son. Where is Streep all this time? She turns up later a supposedly new woman and announces out of the blue that she wants custody even if father and son have bonded together to the point of being inseparable.This is a battle to the psychological death between the parents of the adorable Justin Henry, and even when he's being a brat (condemning the Salisbury steak Hoffman made for him and demanding chocolate chip ice cream instead), he's adorable. Father Hoffman can't deal with kid temper tantrums, telling the crying boy demanding his mommy, "Well, I'm all you've got!". But to tearful satisfaction of the audience, the two apologize to each other, and now, being motherless doesn't seem like such a bad thing. It's obvious whose side the audience is going to be on when this case goes to court.By this point in his career, Dustin Hoffman was always the best man at the Oscar's, never the groom, and even though he had fierce competition, it was very obvious that he was going to win for his very human betrayal of a man who changes because he has no other choice. There is great debate whether or not Meryl Streep deserved her first Oscar for this because her character of Joanna is a very contradictory character. She's minus the accents, too, of Streep's other Oscar winning characters, as well as minus sympathy as well because, mother or not, she did choose to abandon her son while "finding herself", and her sudden desire to disrupt his life certainly is very selfish. But selfish or not, she's all very human, and nobody would deny her access to Billy, just as long as Hoffman's Ted keeps him full time.Jane Alexander offers excellent support as their downstairs neighbor who indirectly gave Streep the courage to leave in the first place. Veteran actor Howard Duff is also very commanding as Hoffman's attorney, while JoBeth Williams has a very amusing cameo as one of Hoffman's dates who has a very embarrassing meeting with young Henry in the hall. (A TCM broadcast of this deleted the sequence since it contained brief nudity, disproving their "uncut" claim about the movies they show). The musical score is also very memorable, consisting of classical music re-arranged to sound almost new. New York City locales add to the charm of this movie. How can you not walk through central park and think of the few scenes which take place there from this movie? Winning Best Picture the same year over such formidable competition as "Norma Rae", "All That Jazz", "Apolocalypse Now" and "Breaking Away", this may not seem typical Academy material, but it certainly became very beloved all around. Justin Henry, too, took attention away from younger Ricky Schroeder who had been praised earlier in the year for the remake of "The Champ" but was pretty much forgotten by Oscar time. In reflection, while Schroeder's performance required a lot of tears and came from a film that had a mixed critical reaction, Henry's performance seemed almost effortless, as if he was living this character, from the moment he exhaustedly goes to the bathroom (realistically not flushing after being finished) to the scene where he sees his mother for the first time in over a year and runs into her waiting arms. Soap opera material for sure, but done realistically, this has emotional effect of some of the great theatrical dramas of the past fifty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made About Divorce and Custody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman had already been riding high in the movies long before doing this. Things like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy showed that he was then and is now one of the best of the best. Kramer vs Kramer is arguably his best movie and most powerful performance. The only other arguably better is Rain Man. But Kramer vs Kramer and Rain Man are vastly different, with both leaving equal impacts.Ted Kramer (Hoffman) is a successful workaholic advertising executive. One night after returning home late with big news, he finds out his wife (Streep), who feels isolated and socially abandoned, is leaving him and their son Billy (Henry). Ted's frustrations about being both parents to Billy and doing well in his job become virtually unbearable. While Billy must deal with the abandonment of his mother and the weak relationship he has with his father. Just as Ted starts becoming a good parent to Billy and a success again at work, Joanna returns wanting her son back. Ted bears a slim chance of winning.I read the Avery Corman novel before seeing the movie. It was the first and only time I have ever legitimately cried while reading. Some things in the movie have been changed, but most things have just been taken away. The novel isn't long, but the movie would likely be a miniseries if went directly by the book. So is the book better than the movie? With a different cast, it would have been. As mentioned before, Hoffman gives the performance of a lifetime as a pressured yuppie. Hoffman plays Ted as a heroic type that will do anything he can to be the best parent he can be. Meryl Streep won her first Oscar for and is also one of her most underrated roles. One of the themes in the movie is women's rights and gender equality, that is seen as Joanna gives reasons for walking out on her husband and son. Justin Henry was just a little kid that gave a better performance than half of everybody in 1979. In the 70s, divorce was an uncommon thing. Now, divorces happen left, right and centre. So Kramer vs Kramer is perhaps more relevant today than in the 70s. With divorce and custody as the main themes, gender equality, social abandonment and work balancing are other themes that are shown very well in this. You will watch this movie and never forget how it impacts you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly executed drama film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer really shows all of us of what kind of emotional effect a divorce between parents can really feel like to their children. The movie stars Dustin Hoffman as an adman named Ted Kramer who has gone through divorce by his wife Joanna (played by Meryl Streep.)and takes care of his son Billy (played by Justin Henry.)for more than a year. While Hoffman's character takes care of his son he gets let go from his first job by his first boss then gets another job on the next day which is 3 days before Christmas. Director Robert Benton has created a drama movie masterpiece while creating this film. Also the movie got the main people in the film their first Oscars, which was Dustin Hoffman for best actor and Meryl Streep for best supporting actress. The acting in this movie is perfect for a drama movie with great actors portraying their character the way they were supposed to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs Kramer is an excellent movie. The story is pretty easy - SPOILER - there is a family, the mother (Meryl Streep) escape from home and the father (Dustin Hoffman) have to deal with everything, including their son, by himself. The acting is tremendous and Mr Hoffman and Mrs Streeo are at their best. There are no unexpected twists in the plot and it's very easy to follow the story. Even though a plot without twists doesn't seem very appealing, the acting will get you glued to screen. Furthermore all the music and the shots are very accurate and precise; especially for a movie realized in 1979. I suggest everyone to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman delivers another excellent Academy Award performance as Ted Kramer, a husband and father who one day is stunned to learn that his wife Joanna(Meryl Streep) has left him to find herself, leaving Ted heartbroken but also with custody of their young boy(Justin Henry, quite good). Ted tries to raise his son, while dealing with his anger toward Joanna, and trying to juggle his career responsibilities, which take quite a toll on him, though he eventually comes to bond with his son closely, which is disrupted by the sudden reappearance of Joanna, who wants custody, and has a lawyer, though what the court decides may not be the final word...Powerful drama has superb performance from the cast, expert direction by Robert Benton, and a mature, thought provoking script. Ultimately quite moving, with an unexpected ending that has left viewers talking.Academy Award winner for best picture and director as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A just-divorced man (Dustin Hoffman) must learn to care for his son (Justin Henry) on his own, and then must fight in court to keep custody of him.Two things I wanted to talk about here: Dustin Hoffman's Oscar and JoBeth Williams' nudity. The Oscar is a bit of a mystery to me, and seems to be given to Hoffman for the film's content more than his actual performance. Now, I am not criticizing or insulting Hoffman -- he is a wonderful actor and is wonderful here. I just find it odd, after having seen "Papillon" and his other work of the era, that this is the film wherein he was awarded. It seems like his most impressive stuff was overlooked.Now, the nudity. It still amazes me to this day hat late 1970s and early 1980s movies could have nudity and still get a PG rating. It does not offend me (heck, show as much nudity as you want) but it does make me wonder why the MPAA became so lax in that time period...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Kramer Vs Kramer was a delicious surprise. At first I thought this was only another Hollywood dramas in which people cry all the time and make you cry as well (humans are naturally prone to cry in front of other people crying, and Hollywood takes a lot of advantage on it). Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in this movie, just as Meryl. They're both very talented. This movie captured my attention and emotions in the very first 20 minutes, which is rare when it comes to drama. It happened that I caught myself crying like a little baby at the end of the movie. It really made me think about how destructive a divorce can be, just as much as an unhappy marriage.

		<fullReview>Ted Kramer struggles to rise in the ranks in his firm over the years and when he finally succeeds, he returns home to share the joy with his family only to stand dumbfounded as his wife divorces him. A hard-working man, Ted finds it cumbersome to manage both his child and work schedule; gets exasperated by the child's demand for the return of his mother. The bond between the father and son grows as the time goes by and Ted gives more importance to his son than to his job which leads to his firing ultimately. Joanna Kramer returns back after sometime and files a lawsuit to claim the responsibility of their child. Joanna wins the case on terms of motherhood but Ted wins the heart of Joanna as a caring father who would risk his career for his son. And as the saying goes "they lived happily ever after".It was easily the best performances Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep gave in their acting career. If only Meryl Streep was awarded the Best Actress in a Leading role, the movie could have swept the 5 major Oscars. The courtroom scenes were well-scripted, well-directed, and the duo performed brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic that is of historical significance to both in this country and the woman's movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So one of my earliest memories from childhood is seeing this movie from 1979 with my parents in the theater. I will never forget the kid falling off the jungle gym and that "blank" (pardon my french) Meryl Streep using it against Dustin Hoffman in court. I think it is great that the two stars from this movie are still relevant today more than 30 years later. This is a classic. I think what spoke to me most about this movie was how it mirrored in subtle and not so subtle tones the changing landscape in America that really gained momentum in the 1970's. How women are more than just the roles men assign them, how men can make caring fathers, that women can and sometimes should make more money than men, how not all marriages are going to last forever, and finally how that can affect a small child. I can't say for sure but because of those struggles not so long ago, I think kids today are better prepared for divorce today. Its all around them, and there are support systems both private and public. We learned a lot from struggles that seemingly occurred ages ago. That is what I liked about Kramer vs. Kramer, it made me think as well as entertain. I am not sure that was the purpose behind this Robert Benton creation, but I think just like movies such as "inherit the wind" paint a picture from another time in American History and how we have changed as a people since, this movie does that as well. In that sense it also shows how much we have not changed at our core. If you haven't seen this film yet I don't think you can go wrong, and if you haven't seen it for several years check it out again, you might just find yourself thinking about this American life as well. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I fell in love with it, being a Streep fan, and automatically decided it is one of the best films I have ever seen. I am not usually one to watch courtroom dramas, but this movie is irresistible. It walks through the life of an unhappy, disconnected couple and the custody battle over their young son after the wife leaves the home to find herself. One of the better films of the 1970s, right alongside The Last Picture Show, another favorite of mine. If you haven't seen Kramer Vs Kramer, give it a watch.I give it an A+ rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best picture winner of 1979 was an absolutely terrific picture.Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep turned in Oscar calibrated performances as best actor and supporting actress, respectively.As Joanna, Streep is a disillusioned wife expecting more of life. At a critical point in their married life, Streep walks out on Hoffman and the latter has to learn to play both parental roles to their young son Justin Henry.Henry does a remarkable job with perfect timing here. He really deserved the nomination for best supporting actor. However, he would lose to Melvyn Douglas in "Being There." As an understanding neighbor, Jane Alexander was nominated in the supporting category, but was no match to Ms. Streep.The custody battle is well contested in the film. Both parties give justification for this reasons of wanting control over their young son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that showcases the emotions of divorce and child custody. And uses the sexism theme well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" in my opinion isn't a great movie, yet it is still a very good one and very watchable due to the performances of Hoffman and Streep. The issue that dominates the film child custody to me is outdone as this film to me has a stronger emotional theme of sexism, it clearly shows that a man can be just as emotional as a woman. Dustin Hoffman stars as Ted Kramer a hard working adman for a firm and he's married to Joanna(Meryl Streep) a pr magazine rep both are successful and typical New York City people. The big difference is Ted seems more at peace he just works himself to hard, while Joanna has insecurities and doesn't really know who she is yet. So one day Joanna leaves out and says it's over a shock and blow to Ted, because she's leaving their son Billy(Justin Henry) with him to raise as her discovery and search for inner self will be found in California. The scenes are fun and heart warming with Ted trying to cook french toast hey that's a woman's thing! Don't worry he learns how to make it before the films end! Slowly the bond of father and son relationship develops it becomes as close as the one Billy had with his mother really a switching of genders. And it's memorable the emotions and love that Ted gives Billy after he falls on the playground and gets stitched up it really shows a loving and caring compassion that fathers can have. Only the film then shifts to a drama when Joanna returns saying that she found herself on the west coast and she wants Billy back. So then with a tough custody battle, Ted is fired yet he's a fighter and finds a job that pays less, but yet he supports him and Billy thru the hard times. Ted may not have been the victor in court yet in Billy's heart he was as you the viewer see in the end Billy sees the real light and has grown to love and feel a bond with his father and that's who he wants to be with. A good film yet nothing great the two key elements that carry it are the Dustin Hoffman performance, Streep's was okay one of her early ones, but most of all the movie proved a man can feel compassion and love and raise a child and become just as attached as a mother even though many feel this is unfair sexism it's just a showing of good gender equality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And an affecting story, at that. The acting is temperate, not overdone, and the situation is real. Dustin Hoffman as a mid-level ad executive, suddenly dealing with his wife's desertion. The Streep character certainly comes off as cold, initially, but there are subtle layers of confusion and indecision, as anyone who has ever endured a divorce or family estrangement will be quite familiar with.I do not agree this is a black and white issue; few human stories are. The interactions with Justin Henry and Hoffman are memorable and heartbreaking at times, the child confused as to why his mother would just leave the family home.A few good cameo performances with Jane Alexander as the concerned neighbor, Howard Duff as Shaunessey, Kramer's family law attorney, and George Coe as Hoffman's heartless boss who fires him even as he is at the height of a custody battle.Overall, a significant film which still holds up today. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER---This comment contains spoilers---SPOILERI had always heard about this film, but only got the chance to watch it two nights ago when it was on the TV. It was on really late, but I really wanted to watch it and I am really glad I stayed up. The story is based around Dustin Hoffman's character, Ted and his wife Joanna played by Meryl Streep and their young son, Billy, played by Justin Henry. Joanna decides to leave Ted and Billy after being unhappy for quite some time. Most of the film deals with the relationship between Billy and Ted. Ted is a busy and hard working father and it takes time for him to become the father that Billy needs. But the relationship really grows. Jane Alexander acts as the kind neighbour. Then Joanna comes back into the picture after finding herself and wants Billy back. A moving court battle follows, which predictably favours the mother. SPOILER- On the day Joanna goes to collect Billy, she decides it would be better if he stayed with Ted. I really enjoyed this film. The acting was outstanding, especially by Hoffman and Henry. I really felt for both of them and I really enjoyed watching their relationship develop. I didn't like Joanna's character. Im not saying I don't like Streep, I think Streep is a very good actress. I just didn't like her character and I didn't have that much sympathy for her nor did I feel she should get custody of Billy. I really really really expected the film to end with her taking Billy and was so happy that he stayed with Ted. I expected and would have liked to see more of the custody battle, where as that only happened in the last bit of the film. Also I would have liked to see more at the end for instance what is Billy's reaction when he is told that he is staying with his dad and I would have liked to see how the relationship between the three of them worked out</fullReview>

I love the fact that they filmed in New York City by showing the sights and sounds of New York in 1979. I thought Meryl Streep showed that she's a scene stealer in this film and deserved her academy award as well as Dustin Hoffman did for Best Actor. Jane Alexander is superb as the supportive divorcée and single mother Margaret. Justin Henry proved his acting abilities as a young ten year old in this special role. The direction of the film moves quite decently for this melodrama. Films about divorce have come and gone but this film is still a classic because it seems so genuine, real, and authentic. If you have a first rate cast, writing, and a great director, Robert Benton, the film is an American classic in the same sense as Ordinary People. It's still a movie that everybody can relate too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Performances From Hoffman and Henry, Great Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film in maybe twenty years. When I first saw it I was not a parent; I am now. There are few films that do a better job of explaining of how it feels to be a parent, and how much a young child depends on you.Be sure to watch the outstanding documentary about the film (after you see the movie!)--it gives you a rare look into the wonderful collaborative atmosphere that surrounded this movie. You can see why some directors who like to have total control (hello, Woody!) would not enjoy working with Hoffman, but you can see how wise Benton was to draw on Hoffman's own personal experience of divorce. The movie is so rich, the performances so real, the direction nicely understated when it needs to be, and the emotions so intense.This is a "small film" that is so well done, it illuminates better than any grand statement about parenting ever could. I was deeply moved by this film.As I say in the summary--the rapport between Hoffman and young Justin Henry is so real, and their individual and collective performances are off the scale. They're too realistic and human to even measure. I've never seen anything so authentic. Director Benton deserves so much credit for letting the actors find the truth of this movie's story.In terms of weaknesses, there are few, but I thought Ms. Streep wasn't quite as convincing as the rest (she's better near the end), and that Hoffman's "party kiss" was also a false note. Other than that, everything else is so true that I really had to give the film a ten, and the DVD with this fantastic documentary also merits a ten. It was so generous of all the creative talent to give their time for interviews over twenty years later.Great, great film!! You can see why it won five Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that the prospect of seeing a movie about a divorce and child custody battle was all that exciting for me, Academy Awards notwithstanding. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find that KRAMER vs. KRAMER is a fairly impressive picture. Above all, the acting by all the principal characters is outstanding, and the writers &amp; director were successful in preventing the film from degenerating into just another early-afternoon soap opera. The well-crafted and surprising (and, in all fairness, rather unrealistic) conclusion made the story ultimately palatable.As a man watching the movie I tried to be objective, but within the first 30 minutes my allegiences were squarely with Ted (Dustin). Upon realizing his abandonment and understanding his predicament, he immediately reconfigures his priorities to care for his son, even to the point where it costs him his job (which, we are led to believe, was the totality of his existence). Then Joanna (Meryl) has the audacity to return from wherever, spout the nauseautingly familiar mid-70's feminist tripe about "finding herself" and getting away from an "oppressive" home life, and THEN ask for her kid back. Not exactly a character that would generate any sympathy in my view. In fact (again, straining to be objective), it seems to me that the entire picture is oriented to make Ted (not Joanna) the object of sympathy. I wonder if other people had the same impression. From a legal perspective, KRAMER vs. KRAMER doesn't cover the divorce itself -- it just sort of happens within a year or so; no mention of how it happened. The courtroom battle of course relates to the custody issue and, contrary to some, I found this element of the movie rather weak. Ted's counsel could have made a stronger case, and Joanna's case was (in my not entirely unprejudiced view) rather flimsy. However, the overall outcome probably wouldn't have been any different in the real world, and so perhaps the producers chose not to devote an overwhelming amount of time to this sequence so that it wouldn't become the "centerpiece" of the film.In summary, a film I was surprised to find enjoyable and, based on the competition (and I'm not a big APOCALYPSE fan), a worthy Best Picture winner for 1979.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's very good, but didn't quite deserve the Oscar sweep which it received.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A virtually flawless drama concerning marriage break-up and the ensuing custody battle. Don't be put off by the storyline - the film has quality stamped all over it, and anybody with an appreciation for the cinema will lap it up. I'm a B Movie horror &amp; sci-fi fan, but 'Kramer vs Kramer' is still in my Top 50 films of all time list.I'm sure everyone is familiar with the plot, so I won't go over old ground. Needless to say that Dustin Hoffman is excellent, but is matched by Justin Henry who really does give a performance by an 8 year old which is Oscar worthy (he was nominated for Supporting Actor but didn't win). Meryl Streep is fine in a difficult role which is bound to elicit little sympathy from the audience - fortunately her part becomes more secondary as the storyline develops.There's little else to say really - the classical music score is spot-on, the film forces you to cry without resorting to crass tear-jerking sentimentality and the ending works, despite being a bit implausible. A fine film to round off the best decade of cinema. The only real grumble I have is that 'Kramer vs Kramer' was used by the 'powers-that-be' to make a point and dampen down the fire which the new wave of young, radical directors were stirring. The film was rushed out by Columbia to qualify for the 1979 Academy Awards and compete against 'Apocalypse Now'. As top notch as 'Kramer vs Kramer' is, the Best Film Oscar it won should have rightfully gone to Coppola's Vietnam epic.BEST SCENE - the French Toast breakfast fiasco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that this film is a masterpiece is dependent on the amount of emotional trauma one is willing to deal with in one sitting. Yes, it semi-accurately depicts the effects of divorce on the modern family. Yes, it makes us all think about the characters in the movie and how they cope. Yes, it's not necessarily a worst case scenario but it's not much better. The pacing is frenetic at times and dull in others. The story left me empty and cold. Other than the famous scene with Jobeth Williams I can't really say I was entertained at all. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more realistic family films of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A composite of the too-familiar child custody battle, Oscar winner "Kramer Vs. Kramer" profiles Ted, Joanna, and young Billy Kramer (Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and Justin Henry). Selfish, deadbeat mom Streep leaves on a quest to "find herself," leaving Hoffman to care for young Henry, until she returns, bringing an ugly custody battle with her. Explores the points of view of all camps involved in the legal war, and shows with realism the underhanded legal tactics of Joanna's lawyers. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep garnered Oscars for their enduring, believable performances, and young Henry earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination. A flawless screenplay and great acting rounds out one of the greatest, most realistic family films of all time, complete with a believable and satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling film about divorce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in the winter of 1980. I remember feeling drained when I left the theater. I don't remember any other movie that has made me both laugh and cry so hard. The scenes at the grocery store being a good example of the former. Meryl Streep's reply to being asked if she was a failure as a wife and a mother by her husband's attorney, a good example of the latter. Dustin Hoffman deservedly won an Oscar for this film. His character asks if a mother is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex. It's an interesting question that caused a lot of discussion when the film was in theaters. But Meryl Streep's mother answers the question when she realizes that her taking custody of Billy would mean totally disrupting his life once again. What she does is very unselfish and that is something that probably does make a mother the better of the two parents. If a choice has to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the title of "Kramer vs. Kramer" deceive you, since it's more about Hoffman's character than an actual showdown between Hoffman and Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to see the 1979 Oscar-winning drama "Kramer vs. Kramer" for the sole purpose of seeing Meryl Streep, then you should be prepared to be disappointed since she's not in the movie as much as the posters are claiming. Even though she's claimed one of the two top billings for this movie, she's only in it for about half the length of the film at most. I know such a comment is a little unusual to make, but I think it's important that I mention it now before my readers read the rest of this review. With that said, let's continue to talk about "Kramer vs. Kramer". As far as all of the Best Picture Oscar winning films go, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the more forgettable ones. While it's undeniably well acted, there are still major pet peeves that I had with the film. Dustin Hoffman plays a very busy advertising executive who has just landed an important assignment that will lead to a big payday. When he gets home late and tries to tell his wife (Meryl Streep) the good news, she tells him that she wants a divorce and leaves him. Whatever reasons why their relationship had deteriorated aren't really explained that well. There's a scene with the couple in a coffee shop where they act like a happy couple for the first couple seconds, but then they abruptly and forcefully act hostile towards each other that proves that weakness. Anyways, let's keep going. This divorce becomes a serious issue for him in that he has to take care of their child (Justin Henry) all by himself and the fact that he has too busy a work schedule to take care of him. When they become forced to spend quality time together, they don't care much for each other at first. But to the surprise of very few people in the audience including myself, they start to warm up more to each other. So when the time comes in which the parents have to battle for custody of the child, the child is left with an unbearable situation to undergo. As I stated in the introduction, Meryl Streep isn't given enough screen time. Considering the fact that her character put this story into motion in the first place, she should have been given more focus and depth than what she got. Noting that the film lasts more than an hour and a half, I honestly think that she was only in the movie for about half an hour which is inexcusable. While the writers handle Hoffman's story fairly well, they should have done much more with Streep's. But that isn't the only significant problem that I have with this flick. I realize the comment I'm about to make might sound unfair. But as long as reviews such as this are meant to express one's feelings, I feel that it's best to simply say it. I didn't like the kid that the parents were battling over. He came off as sort of an unlikable brat. He's too whiny and fueled with negativity, he causes a lot of trouble, and when he gets himself hurt, I felt no sympathy for him since he sort of had it coming due to the arrogant, careless behavior he commits. While you could argue that he's going through a terrible situation for a child, I could also counter argue that he could have been less obnoxious. With that said, the film has some very good performances behind it. Dustin Hoffman is believable as the busy father who tries to reconnect with his son in the midst of this unfortunate separation. Jane Alexander is warm and likable as his neighbor who also has to take care of a child on her own and tries to support him when he most needs it. I think if the kid were less whiny, if the wife was more developed and had more screen time, and if we understood why the relationship went downhill in the first place, "Kramer vs. Kramer" would have been better. As it is though, it's average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abundance of talent makes for cinema's most extraordinary domestic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. That's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman.The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in Academy Awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie &amp; Clyde" and "Superman") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as "Kramer vs. Kramer" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep have made better, more absorbing movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director Robert Benton's "Kramer vs. Kramer," Dustin Hoffman plays advertising salesman Ted Kramer who suddenly finds himself offered a partnership in the ad agency if he can bring in one of the biggest accounts. Elated by his big break, Kramer rushes home, late as usual, to give his wife Joanne (Meryl Streep) the good news. But Joanne shatters Ted's joy. She declares that she must leave him, no longer loves him, and must go away to find herself before she goes crazy and commits suicide.Abandoned by his wife, Ted slowly goes to pieces. He finds himself doubling as father and mother to his seven-year old son Billy. Newcomer Justin Henry plays the role with great restraint and doesn't steal the movie simply because he is cute and little. At the same time, Billy cannot cope with the loss of his mother. Kramer realizes gradually what Joanne endured and despite his energy and chin-up efforts to wring success from disaster, his own world collapses. Ted's responsibilities at the office clash with his duties as a dad. Although his boss gave him the big break, he begins to have second thoughts.About this time, Joanne returns. She tells Ted that she has recovered after a sojourn in California when she went into analysis. She has a good-paying job now and wants her son back. Kramer explodes. Nobody but nobody will take Billy away from him. A court battle over custody erupts. Abruptly, Kramer loses his job and must find a new one in twenty-four hours if he is to give his lawyer (elegantly played by the worldly, cane-wielding Howard Duff) a fighting chance.Robert Benton wrote and directed "Kramer vs. Kramer" from Avery Corman's bestselling novel. Certainly a movie about two parents fighting over which gains custody of a child is not the kind of movie calculated to lure filmgoers in for an evening of lighthearted, escapist entertainment. Thrill-seekers will find nothing here that is remotely spectacular. Nobody gets shot, and cars don't careen down thoroughfares ramming each other. Indeed, "Kramer vs. Kramer" qualifies as a movie about people, their emotions, and about what makes an adult a fit parent. Several interesting issues are raised. For example, why is it that a mother by virtue of her sex is presumed to be a better parent? When it was originally released, the domestic and legal woes of "Kramer vs. Kramer" were anti-commercial during a film season dominated by competitive, big budget pictures struggling to overshadow each other. Considering this predicament, writer &amp; director Benton and producer Stanley Jaffe were applauded for their courage.Benton's impressive screen credits as a scenarist include "Bonnie &amp; Clyde," "The Late Show," and "Superman." In "Kramer vs. Kramer," Benton has shrewdly deployed his characters in a story that leaves the issue of who hurts whom hard. Moviegoers may initially side with Ted because Dustin Hoffman is so lovable. Further, Ted has to struggle with bringing up Billy, providing for him, and keeping him in smiles. True, Joanne accuses Ted of ignoring her as a wife and a person. But we only have her word. Actors like Hoffman and Robert Redford seldom play heels, perhaps because the public cannot accept them as unsavory. Consequently, their villainy parceled out in the dialogue but rarely depicted physically.Once Meryl Streep returns, especially while on trial, her genuine remorse for abandoning Billy and her desire to be a mother again, with her tremendous efforts to prove her worth as a mother, should win the sympathy of the most die-hard cynic. The best thing about "Kramer vs. Kramer" is that Benton resists the tendency to make either star a hero or a villain. Although the Kramers are fighting each other, neither deliberately stoops to the dirty tactics of their lawyers. When Ted's attorney asks Joanne if she were a failure at the single most important relationship in her life, she hesitates. Clearly guilt-stricken, she looks at Ted who mouths a silent "no" for her. Later, when Joanne's lawyer attacks Ted because Billy almost lost an eye in a playground accident owing to Ted's apparent negligence, she assures Ted that she never thought her lawyer would make the event an issue in court. Benton should be applauded for not giving either parent a clear-cut case and making one more sympathetic than the other.Benton's tactics, however, backfire. Neither Kramer wants to hurt the other. They just want to have Billy. The court battle forces them to play dirty which neither want to do. This is where "Kramer vs. Kramer" falls apart. The noble actions of both Kramers, their desire not to drag Billy into the courtroom, seem just too good to be true. It's a fault that Benton can overcome. Ordinarily, parents battling over custody rarely reflect on what benefits the child. While "Kramer vs. Kramer" doesn't quite measure up to the lofty label of masterpiece that many critics apply to it, Benton's film contains several good moments and even some brilliant ones, too! "Kramer vs. Kramer" gets off to a shaky start. We are shattered by the abruptness of Joanne's departure as is poor Ted. Afterward, the action settles into stride, as Ted copes with the pains of bringing up Billy. As a director, Benton is in top form showing how Billy and Ted grow closer to each other and develop a lifestyle. In a cinema season that had little to offer in terms of genuinely humane drama, "Kramer vs. Kramer" easily won kudos by default. Nevertheless, good as the film is, Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep have made better, more absorbing movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. I agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that this is what what made the film good. It didn't villainies either Mr. or Mrs. Kramer and it was refreshing, I think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for Billy. And, although it was a little strange, I actually liked the music in this film as well. For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. This movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. It dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. It simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Kramer vs Kramer" is an old-fashion type of ethic film with "tear + handkerchief" pattern, yet along with concentration on the moral values based on conventional family affairs case study via depiction of everyday life, the film still has offered very calm and rational observation on unconventional angle and tried to get key problems revealed for attention then discussion. As a feature film, it's used technique the documentary usually uses, which renders the basic tone with on families. It's actually story to fit my time but set up in different cultural environment with mine because I got similar age with Billy's. The minimalism storyline has been strictly framed within a case of court battle, following which the struggle for a son ward ship between parents was recorded comprehensively on various levels and angles. In fact, the film's painted an imagery of family affair for audience with Kramers as very much reflection of the condition of other families worldwide. The film becomes gradually fascinating alongside the step-by-step deeper analysis of society then conflicts getting more serious, eventually, the nature of countless social problems step-by-step came up with digging then discovering. Despite the title seems to suggest the battle between parents, actually much beyond that, it is a bit tricky and witty, an implication of struggling between Ted Kramer, his wife Joanna Kramer and his son Billy Kramer. The film ends with court sentence, no winners instead of all exhausted losers because the court would give Billy painful experience really as the crime his parents committed has.Once the court started to process the case of son's ward right, Billy was badly hurt in psychological term just like a victim. Moreover, the lawyer on behalf of Ted Kramer seems out of control and lost his mind when the result defines them losers, he even wanted to take account of innocence of victim to gain sympathy then win this war, with that they consider to make appeal with Billy appearing on court. The court event will haunt Billy's growing-up life as very severe spiritual pain, which will be healed long time after.Sometimes, the mankind's cruelty could be expressed even much more serious than animal kind's. Disney's "Lion King" has proved that how much encouragement dad lion prepared to save his son's life when attacked by wolves. Dad lion always tried to protect son all time with fearless passion. Mankind would be taught the lesson of love for survival because man's just pupil to nature. In reality, the friendly relationship between people on highly civilisation level does not exist anymore since the law rules the world. People has to express or be expressed the cruelty against somebody else for their own survival in such an urbanised environment. What a stupid pursuit to civilisation! The most ruthless careers must include lawyer and doctor. Yet both of them have been earning the most expensive salary, meanwhile both are ruthless group without any mercy to clients. Thus it seems that new social rule was established --- More cruel, More earning, More acceptable eventually by society, what a bitter joking.God makes people, people make trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's message to the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great film's of the seventies, an era when many Hollywood films espoused a great liberal message to the world. That message is basically that if we are all a little more understanding of people's differences, then we can all get along a lot better. The film shows a father being thrust into an unorthodox family unit - just him and his seven year old son. It shows him doing a good job too and benefiting from the experience. It shows that as much as we try to live in conventional family units, sometimes that is not possible. And that we should sometimes show people living outside the norm as heroes. SPOILER The reconciliation at the end between the mother and dad also encourages us to understand and listen to others more. Possibly I am reading too much into the film, but watching it for the first time after all these years, that seems to be the stark message it has for our times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrenching custody battle highlights anguish of divorce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic work of cinema that captures vividly the agony of divorce, primarily from the perspective of the father. Dustin Hoffman displays sheer perfection in his role as a newly divorced dad who must adjust to the demanding role of sole caregiver to his young son, Billy, all the while trying to juggle these new parental demands with his job responsibilities. Meryl Streep is competent in the extremely unsympathetic role of the self centered mother who feels ignored, unappreciated, and generally put upon by her workaholic husband and goes off to seek her own self fulfillment, unfortunately abandoning her poor, innocent young son in the process.The story begins when Joanna Kramer seeks a divorce from said workaholic husband, Ted, who admittedly, and not to his credit, has put his advertising career ahead of his family. She leaves their little boy, Billy, in the care of her husband, who really in a sense doesn't even know his son, and must now learn to do all the mundane little tasks (such as cooking breakfast) that of course Joanna always used to do. In the process, Ted develops a genuinely close bond with Billy, and vice versa. Later Joanna returns, wants Billy back, and a custody battle ensues...Kramer vs. Kramer. The film gives a marvelous portrayal of Ted's wrenching situation as he has the responsibilities of single parenthood foisted upon him, in addition of course to coping with the devastation of marital break up. We see Ted getting to know both his son and his way around the kitchen, developing a mutual sense of closeness with Billy, and engaging in all the touching little daily routines the pair establish in their household. Above all, the devastation of this father is conveyed vividly, as he faces the frightening prospect of losing custody of his son. Personally, I found Joanna so intensely self absorbed and undependable, I felt like slapping her most of the time and cannot imagine that she would elicit much sympathy from the majority of viewers. Parenthood is not a role that provides for sabbatical leave and her attitude of "Now I'm back and ready to be a mother again" failed to cut it with me.The court battle is riveting, especially as we cheer so totally for the ill treated father here. It shows the justice system's tendency to favor the mother, unless she is declared unfit. I personally see this as the case here, since Joanna has abandoned her son for her own selfish pursuits. However, the judge of course doesn't see matters quite from this point of view. Also, the film highlights the court's definition of parental fitness in terms of financial success. Joanna (the unstable, undependable, irresponsible parent) has in fact obtained a good employment position since she abandoned her motherhood role and now earns a substantial salary, while Ted (the stable, dependable, and responsible parent) has unfortunately been demoted due to the time constraints of single fatherhood.The movie gives a masterful portrayal of this father's struggle and of course the overall anguish of divorce, though unfortunately NOT told from the viewpoint of its major victim...the child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Billy (the kid - no pun) was really good in this film. Apparently the scene with the French toast (if they remade it now, would that be Freedom toast?!?), the ice cream scene, and the meeting in the café with the wine glass smashing were all improvised.It would have been easy for this to oversentimentalise, and I know a few people were disappointed with the ending. But I thought it was good. Life is random, and '70s films don't all have to have an anti-Hollywood ending.All in all, fine performances from Dustin, Meryl and the boy. While not a classic '70s movie in the mold of Chinatown, Taxi Driver or Godfather, this is still well worth the two-and-whatever hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every moment rings true in Benton-Hoffman depiction of divorce. Such emotional depth. A beautiful, perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's Streetcar Named Desire. I imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. So its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular. One of the best child performances ever.But I also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. It has such excellent narrative drive. Once you stick Kramer vs Kramer on, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. And even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.Make no mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.10/10.For one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. Not to mention what a great, involving story it is. Put simply, a perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely powerful with one of Hoffman's best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly moved by this powerful motion picture that doesn't seem to contain a single weak moment. Though there are a couple of films from the 70's that I regard as great, and this will be added to the list now that I finally got to see it, in general films of that decade had the tendency to be slow and boring. I didn't feel the same way about "Kramer vs. Kramer" at all. It does a terrific job at showing how much the divorce of two parents can really hurt a child, as well as the value of spending time with a child and not putting things like work as a top priority. Dustin Hoffman's character is sympathetic, but flawed, and that's what I liked so much about him. He isn't written as a caricature, but like a real father in that type of situation. You're able to sympathize both with his willingness to keep his job, and the child's willingness to spend time with him. Nowadays, divorce is such a common thing that it doesn't even seem to be a big issue anymore. Thousands of children end up in the same situation as Billy (Justin Henry). But that doesn't mean we have to take things like that for granted. It must be extremely difficult for a child to find out one day that mommy or daddy can no longer be there for him or her. Though Meryl Streep is only on screen for about 30 minutes, she does a terrific job as well. Even though I didn't sympathize with her deserting her child out of the blue like that, I was able to understand her feelings that conflicted between her love for her son and the overwhelming responsibility of having to be there for him 24/7. Both Hoffman and Streep deserved their Oscars. I don't think Hoffman has ever given a performance that was less than excellent, but his portrayal of Ted Kramer definitely ranks up there as one of his best. It's such a multi-dimensional character and he pulls it off with flying colors. Next to his performance in "Rainman," I have to say this is his best work. And even Justin Henry was wonderful. His chemistry with Hoffman seemed perfectly natural, and my guess is they spend a lot of time bonding off-camera. I always have a theory that whenever a film contains a child as one of the main characters, and it's not some dorky family movie, it usually turns out either good or great. My theory certainly works in this case. Just as a little side note, I find it funny when I compare the MPAA now to how they were 20-30 years ago. The film has a PG rating and it contains a full-length scene where a woman is not only naked, but she's naked in front of a child. Nowadays, that would be too racy for a PG-13. But it's good that it received a PG, because this is a film that parents should watch with their children. My score: 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never experienced divorce at first hand, yet I found this simple film completely compelling. Not just about divorce, it tackles the difficulties of parenthood in general (the chocolate-chip ice cream scene)You might quite rightly think "A divorce movie that tackles the problems of custody? What's so special?" Simply, I have never seen the theme of divorce tackled so intelligently, the script is so realistic, and the character and relationship building between Hoffman and the brilliant Justin Henry in the first half makes the custody battle in court all the more painful. (this aint no TV movie)I have always thought when at his best, Dustin Hoffman is one of the greatest actors in modern Hollywood cinema, you only have to look at the French toast making scene to see this (the dialogue seems so genuine you can barely beleive they're acting). When you combine this with Meryl Streep, how can you go wrong? The character of Ted Kramer's more loose-spirited approach contrasts briliiantly with Streep's icy, more inhibited Joanna Kramer.The snap and crackle of the courtroom scenes, especially the character's heartfelt glances to one-another (which was apparently improvised) shows two actors at the very top of their game.The direction is also top-notch, the connection between the elevator doors closing on the characters married relationship in the beginning of the film, is reversed at the (briliantly simplistic) ending, which shows though their relationship may have ended legally, it may never end emotionally. Also, perhaps the most heart-wrenching scene is again the French toast making towards the end, showing how far Hoffman's relationship with his son has come from the beginning.Finally, the classical Baroque score undertones the wrought emotions displayed in the film perfectly - with a tempo that at times directly contrasts the hopelessness of the character's situations.Overall, a beautifully simplistic picture which deals with one of the most emotionally challenging subjects in todays society, which some of the best performances I have ever seen on screen.(One interesting thought on the movies controversial Best Picture win, no one here seems to disagree with the film's Best Director, Actor, supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay wins - to give the movie these honours and not to give Best Picture would make even less sense)</fullReview>

I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. I don't usually compliment directors, but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, but not great, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 15 when this movie came out and though I remember hearing about it (seemed like that was the only movie people in the media talked about that year) I had no desire to see a film with a litigious title like `Kramer vs. Kramer'. And it is after all an adult movie, appreciated more by people that have been around awhile. I saw this then, for the first time the other day, and I realize that that I would have enjoyed it much more back then. With over 20 years of filmmaking between its release and my initial viewing, many of the film's interesting aspects (cute child actor, modern divorce, father wanting custody, etc) have become trite. It is a fairly even film, probably due to the lack of standout scenes. Not that it is not a good story, and an affecting one, it is simply a drama and keeps the pace of a drama. Paying attention to the first part of the movie will make the payoff (the courtroom scenes) satisfying. A good film, but overrated when considering it won an Academy Award for best picture and it doesn't stand up well to many other winners of that prize. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie but essentially thanks to the master, Dustin Hoffman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's very good about this movie is that it has a little bit of comedy thrown in with a tearjerking drama. However, this isn't one of those movies that rank in a class above others. "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a very good movie that could be placed in the "good movie" class. But if anyone is to say that it's excellent, it's natural that they would say that for Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance Hoffman is Ted Kramer and Meryl Streep is his wife. The movie begins in the middle of the night. Meryl Streep walks into her son's room as he sleeps and wakes him up to tell him goodbye. We automatically guess that she is going to leave her husband and her son. The only problem is that Ted doesn't much time with his son so he doesn't know what he likes and hates. And so begins Ted's true discovery of his love for his son. However, his wife comes back after a while and asks Ted to be allowed to have the boy back for a short while. After his refusal, Meryl Streep takes Hoffman to court demanding custody of the child. The end of the movie is probably the best part of it. The trial scenes are excellent and the ending is one of the sweetest saddest and yet happy endings ever. The best scene of the movie has got to be the ice cream scene. If you're going to watch this movie, watch it for Hoffman's and Streep's performances mainly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly one of the greatest films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail at this, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success.I think everyone would agree the acting is superb. Once you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There's some beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry. He's different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He's amazingly natural.Also, there's some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.If you haven't seen this film yet, you're definitely missing out! See it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why doesn't Kramer vs Kramer get more recognition for the great film that it is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I do not consider Hoffman to be the pinnacle actor from 'the golden age' of the 70s (I mean he clearly must have been doing 'Outbreak' for the money or something), I cannot fault him in this wonderful performance. It is, in my mind, one of the hardest genres to do; the basis for most TV films on on a Thursday afternoon, so hats off to Robert Benton for the TERRIFIC script. Hoffman has never been better as Ted Kramer, and I found myself becoming deeply involved in his plight to keep his son. He rivals Pacino for acting with his eyes (in this I mean the way he uses one simple look to express everything he is feeling - for instance his look after his son tells him that he loves him), and it was just a really believable story portrayed by Hoffman in a really believable way. I feel that writers and directors these days often don't consider what is credible to the audience enough - even in science fiction, if that makes sense. I think that Dustin Hoffman, despite his numerous Oscar nominations and the two he succeeded with (this film rightly being one of those), is underrated and does not get as much praise as he deserves. But one great actor and a great script does not make the perfect movie. Think of the greatest films of all time: Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Casablanca, Schindler's List etc. - all may have great scripts, and all may have great leading actors in Travolta, Brando, Bogart and Neeson, but it is the supporting cast that truly turns a very good film into a great film. Meryl Streep is the best screen actress of all time by a country mile - and her part in this film is a significant one that makes the film what it is. Just watch the courtroom scene - MY GOD that is good acting. And once again, she is believable. She is in nearly all her films, but here this statement rings true more than ever. And do not forget the part of Justin Henry - who unfortunately did not go on to set the acting world alight: a shame considering his obvious talent in this film which in my opinion (and I know I'm laying the praise on pretty thick here) is the best child performance in cinema history: even better than Nathalie Portman in Leon. So to conclude my little film review, I hope that I have influenced someone out there to have a look at this movie that won several Oscars and appreciate it in the way I have. If not for Hoffman, or Streep, or Benton's script, then watch it for Kramer's lawyer's awesome moustache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tale of a Mother Who Leaves Her Family to Find Herself, Doesn't Find Anything, Comes Back for Her Child, But the Father Won't Give Him Up. Solution: Tell it to the Judge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life was going great for New York City advertising artist Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when Ted returned home late from work that night his wife, Joanna, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. It did however affect his performance as a father. He blew up when Billy spilled punch on his client artwork! Well, some time later Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. Ted was distraught. Well, he was late coming home from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy sore at him. Ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. When he got home, he yelled at Billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner. Then later he truthfully told Billy that the break-up between he and Joanna may have been his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard over that night, and well, Billy got his first look at a naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. Ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. After that, life began taking a downward spiral for Ted. Then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner café. At first they have a pleasant conversation but then Joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. Ted would have none of it and stormed out. Well life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. Not only that but Joanna was choosing to sue for custody of Billy, and without a job, Ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. He hired himself a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. And that's IF they win. Ted was also able to find a new job. It was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date, January 9, 1980, arrived. Judge Atkins presiding. Joanna took the stand and Shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left Ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. The next day, Ted took the stand and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. Well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna got sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always ruling in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated about parting ways. They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly Joanna stopped by. She and Ted have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned that Academy Award. I've also seen him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, which he also won an Oscar for. Meryl Streep was good. She also got an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his nomination? I guess the Academy had a rule against giving Oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment came along. This movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. It does a good job of holding your attention. I was watching Rain Man on TCM the other night then this came on after and I just couldn't help but watch. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! A gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. I liked Ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes a good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who passed away in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain who passed away in 1984. Watch for an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. Anyway, see Kramer vs. Kramer today!!! Good movie!!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) Streep co-stars with Dustin Hoffman in this fine film that deals with the sudden breakdown of a couple's marriage and its ultimate end. Streep plays a woman trapped in the traditional role of working wife and mother, who decides to leave the relationship--leaving her child with her husband. Later, in a change of heart, she seeks custody of the child and a court battle ensues.Though not quite a starring role, Streep has considerable screen time and presents a multi-faceted image of a woman attempting to come to terms with who she is and what she wants out of life. It's a moving performance and provocative film, that challenged the accepted strengths and weakness that men and women bring to parenting. The film won Best Picture, Hoffman won Best Actor and Streep won her first Oscar for her performance in a supporting role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am generally hard on movies, but at times biased if the theme or story is something close to home; in this case that may hold true. However, even a good story can be ruined by bad acting, out of place cinematography, or weird philosophical directing. With Kramer vs Kramer, however, the acting was brilliant. The one nuance I want to point out here is that child acted like a child would--curious, but in general doesn't seem all that effected, but is more affected by the bashing exchanges between the mother and father--and this is why this film shines--it sheds light on a subject that children of divorce have to struggle through, among many of the hardships that people don't think of when considering the after-effects of divorce. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in "Rainman", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.A good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.The screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.Still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.The movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie very much. It is interesting and not that long. The ending is satisfying and Everyone Learns Something.However I am not so sure it deserved all the Oscars it received- especially in the case of winners Hoffman and Streep. I think he won because he had lost at least four time previous, and his part was sympathetic. It was almost like the Academy was forcing a truce in their relationship with him. Even at the time, I remember somehow knowing that Streep was going to be a major actress in movies and I consider the Oscar she won a 'thank you' for the career she would have. Both actors were better in movies before and after this, but I suppose that's the nature of the beast when it comes to awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw these movie a week ago and I'm just disappointed. I thought that all would be better, meaning acting and generally film, including screenplay.Meril Streep, she is the most talented actress of all time and I adore her, but I don't think this is her the best performance.THe Script didn't fascinated me, as well. This is a very common story, that I saw in many movies before. Everything important happens in the last few minutes of the movie. The subject develops very slowly and somehow makes me bored.But the best thing in this film is little Kramer. His play is wonderful indeed. He is very natural.The rest is quite normal, but anyway, I rewarded the film with 6 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer vs. Kramer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the two big stars of the film, I knew they both won their first Oscars, and I pretty much knew the concept of the film, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I definitely wasn't going to miss it. Basically Ted Kramer (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) seems to have his work come before his relationship with wife Joanna (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) and eight-year-old son Billy (introducing Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Justin Henry). Joanna decides she can't take anymore, and leaves Ted to look after Billy on his own, which is obviously causing some strain between father and son. When Ted has learnt to adjust to his new responsibilities, and Billy seems to be coping, Joanna comes back and wants her son back. So Ted and Joanna go into court to fight for custody, Ted refuses to give Billy up, and unfortunately he loses, but in the end, Joanna realises her mistake, and that Ted is the better parent for Billy. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jane Alexander as Margaret Phelps, Howard Duff as John Shaunessy, George Coe as Jim O'Connor, JoBeth Williams as Phyllis Bernard, Bill Moor as Gressen, Howland Chamberlain as Judge Atkins, Jack Ramage as Spencer and Jess Osuna as Ackerman. Hoffman is brilliant as the struggling father, and Streep does have her moments too. The best scenes of the film, besides the gripping court case, are when Hoffman tries to bond with his son, and the moments of stress between them, it is just a very convincing and truthful to its content. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Benton, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Streep was number 26, and Hoffman number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart breaking story of what divorce does to the whole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually a fan of guns-and-explosions violent crime thrillers, but this movie is now among my favourite movies of all time. The general plot is that Joanna Kramer(Meryl Streep), after years of marriage, finally walks out on Ted Kramer(Dustin Hoffman), and a court battle ensues over who gets custody over the child. I won't go into too much detail, as that would ruin the story for you. In my opinion Meryl Strepp is the best actress of all time, and she and Dustin Hoffman are as good as always. A must-see movie for all ages, but just a few words of caution: If you don't like depressing movies, this probably isn't the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Overrated Movie and By No Means Hoffman's or Streep's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am awestruck. What is happening. How is this a good movie? How did this movie wind up winning five OSCARS. Unless the Academy was on something, this movie shouldn't even have been nominated.The movie tells the story of a man, Hoffman, being left by his wife at the beginning of the movie to "find herself." Huh? Find herself? Anyway, thats just the beginning. Soon Kramer, the husband, must change himself to accommodate his son. He misses appointments at work and he gets yelled at by the boss. So this is going on and Hoffman is beginning to start a new life. Suddenly Meryl comes back. She wants the son back. Then we go to a trial and somebody, I won't say who, wins.That is essentially the movie in whole. Now how was this Oscar Material. First of all the characters are not likable. I could not feel pity for them at all. I acutally felt pity for the boy in being raised in such a poor environment. Plus, the story didn't seem logical. A mother leaves her child, goes to California for eighteen months, comes back asking for her child back. Why didn't they at least try to maybe heal their marriage?These performances weren't good at all. Although the little boy's performance did make me sad for having been left by his mom and now having to rely on his dad, who hasn't been paying attention to him due to his apperent work-alcoholism.The movie does have a message that I can't reveal cause I don't want to spoil the ending, but once you see the movie you will know what I mean. I do agree with the message the movie is trying to portray, that maybe the father is sometimes better than the mother.The movie was not special in any way. It was jsut another movie, and I must admit it had some really funny, if not touching scenes. One of the scenes was where the boy and the father both sit at the table and read the newspaper at the same time. I just started laughing, it was so funny and touching. Besides another scene which is pretty funny, so I don't want to spoil it, there is nothing special.This was not Hoffman's or Streeps best performance. Far from it. Hoffman's best performance was in Tootsie and Rain Man, for which he won the Oscar. This performance was tame and not convincing as many of his performances are. Streep's performance wasn't Oscar worthy either. People this was not a good movie. Merryl's best performance was in Sophie's Choice, which is in my opinion the greatest acting done ever.I gave the movie a six. I recommend you see the movie for some hilarious scenes and maybe, maybe some heart touching moments. Other than that, it was simply not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic of the divorce genre, but fails to meet my expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer vs. Kramer, the film that became an instant film-classic in the genre of family divorces strikes a chord with me. I have experienced the circumstances of divorce is my life and I was really hoping that the film would give divorce some justice. The story is quite simple in this matter: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is a man who puts his career before his family. One day his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaves him and also leaves her child Billy (Justin Henry) behind. Ted must now learn to be a father to his young son Billy and handle the responsibilities of fatherhood. What happens later in the film is that we start to understand the character of Joanna when she comes back to claim Billy and she takes the problem to court where things should be well, settled, right? The film offered light comedic moments from the first few minutes, but as we get more into the film itself, the comedy just lost its touch. Writer/Director Robert Benton could of had added more development in the film as well as more small snippets of comedic moments.The performances makes the film much, much better.The story lacks dimensions. Throughout the story, I felt that the plot was too simple even though I guess we do lack simplicity in the cinema. The dialogue seemed flat and at some point as if Hoffman was just talking to the wall. But what makes the performances so great? Hoffman and Streep nearly saves the movie and we look at these two actors and think that nobody else can claim this role. They look at everything with honesty and intelligence and we are convinced that these characters are approaching hazardous areas and lines they wish they didn't have to cross. As for Justin Henry, who plays Hoffman's son ? he is quite good here too. (But my favorite child-actor performance still has to be Haley Joel Osment's in the The Sixth Sense.) Jane Alexander, who plays the single mother downstairs has perfect chemistry with Hoffman and we do believe that these two are friends having a everyday conversation. But I don't know how much you can trust me with my review: I haven't even read the book.The best ending ever? (spoilers) I having a mixed reaction to this film, unsure of how I feel about it. But I do have a definite answer to the ending because I loved it. I would try to not to spoil this for people who hasn't seen the film, and for those who have, it would be nice to know if you agree/disagree with me. The scene I am talking about is the very last scene in the lobby, where Ted and Joanna are talking to each other. Joanna is in tears, saying how she was taking her child from his home and Ted tries to comfort her. She wants to have a word with Billy so she enters the elevator to go upstairs and she tries to neaten herself up and asks Ted, "How do I look?" And he answers by simply saying, "You look terrific." The elevator closes between them and the film ends. Is this the best ending ever? Well, I thought so! The documentary found in the DVD ? I would like to put in some comments about the documentary, "Finding the Truth: The Making of Kramer vs. Kramer." I really enjoyed the documentary and learning more about the film. I think the interviews with Hoffman were the most interesting. He is really hilarious to listen to and how he thought Henry looked like a "sitcom kid" is actually a worthy comment. Plus, we hear about how the signature moments in the film is all due to Hoffman's behalf: From the ice cream scene, to the shattered glass scene, and to the court scene where we see Ted nodding his head when Joanna was asked if she was a "good mother." It was also nice to know the ending to this film was Hoffman and Streep talking to each other as well, Hoffman and Streep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. I was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. An adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. That is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. I like the Billy put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV skit. Not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. Touching and intertaining, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy, and how the streets change. Worth a second watch. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer vs Kramer and the Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Kramer vs Kramer. It is a good movie. Unfortunately, I simply can't forget that Kramer vs Kramer stole all the Oscars from Apocalipse Now.From all the unbelievable things the Academy did, this must be one of the top three. To give Oscars to this movie, that basically is now almost completely forgotten, and to diminished an Absolute Master Piece like Apocalipse Now, it is difficult to understand.I like the story and the actors and the plot. But, once again, no matter how hard I tried to forget, Kramer vs Kramer stole Apocalipse Now from the well deserved recognition. And that is something I simply can't erase from my memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About a boy and his father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this movie is actually more about the father. Hoffman, who won his first Best Actor at the Oscar's for this role, has surely done better stuff before this. Most people who have seen "Midnight Cowboy" would vouch for that. However, what's compelling about the film is the relationship between Hoffman and his son, played by a very cute Justin Henry. Hoffman is best when he is paired off with another compelling character - as Anne Bancroft in 'The Graduate', Steve McQueen in 'Papillon', Robert Redford in "All the President's Men" and Tom Cruise in "Rainman" show us. Meryl Streep is a bit lost as the slightly neurotic wife who walks out on the family (a character that feminists would not have been too happy about). All in all worth a watch, but I wouldn't go back to it a second time. I think the reason why the movie did so well was because of the sensitive issue it dealt with -- divorce and custody of a little child in the late 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do people not have strong feelings during a crisis?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about two people breaking up and in the end about a fight for a child. For most of the film both Hoffman and Streep act like nothing much is going on. Like this is not a very serious part of their lives. Only after a good bit of the movie Hoffman starts acting a bit more emotional. I consider that a very serious flaw in this movie. But even worse is Streep's acting. I am not a Streep fan at all. In every film I have seen her, I did not find her credible. And in many films, including this one, I found her acting even irritating. Like she did not understand her role at all and was focused more on her own impression than on her role. Also in Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was for me by far the weakest link.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama with still valid sociological aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since `Midnight Cowboy' I have been on the lookout for films with Dustin Hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. Ever since `Kramer vs Kramer' I have been on the lookout for films with Meryl Streep and have mostly not been disappointed. She gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `Sophie's Decision' and I lapped her up in `Out of Africa'. That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `Kramer vs Kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.On divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most???..Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just simply magnificent. Just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? Benton managed it, and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. The best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.This film came up again on the small screen the other night, though I have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. Around 7? out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I saw this too late. 30 years too late. I kinda, sorta experienced this in a way, being a child of a 70s divorce. But as a kid, I hardly understood it. Hearing my mom lambast my dad for 30 years since has shed enough light on it, but as a film, I dunno.The success of this film ($98 million dollar box-office in 1979!!) and the all the major awards is gobbled up, were definitely a sign of its time. A hot-button issue in the late 70s, of Disco Dads ditching their families for a little extended adolescence on the tiled squares. The only nuance here is that the roles are reversed, and it's dad who's left holding the kid. The wife portrayed here is not a partier, but does go the "I need to find myself" route and disappears for a year.This was my first problem with the film: Streep is barely in it. She bolts for nearly the first hour of the film, not allowing for the title to live up to itself until it's much too late. What follows is a series of vignettes of Hoffman adjusting to the single-dad routine, and the expected chaos it brings. Work-wise, dating-wise, it's all effected. It's during these sequences that Hoffman probably didn't care that Streep was absent, because he's given a tour-de-force playground to carry the film with. Not sure if it was Oscar-worthy, but definitely your typical Hoffman likability.Streep, on the other hand, doesn't work here. When finally glimpsed, she's staring like a stalker through a restaurant window, and of course, shows up later demanding the kid back. Her lawyer's slimeball tactics make her come off worse because we don't really know what *she* was doing in her year away. Which is another direction the film desperately needed to go into. If you want to contrast the breakdown of family and marriage, we need to see a cause, how both parents cope apart, and finally a resolution, to garner a full understanding of both sides. All we know is that Streep went West and got a therapist. Woooooah.As far as Henry is concerned, he wasn't staggering, but he delivered. Again, just like his mother, there are moments where we can't stand him, and he loses our sympathy. Fortunately, by the end of the film, he's come to his father's side and we pull for them as a unit, not just for Hoffman. In typical Hollywood fashion, they go for his waterworks to bleed ours, and it'll be effective for some. It didn't get to me, but that might be a testament to director Benton, for not overdoing it. Just the right note was hit with the kid's weepy reactions.Major demerits for the film's editing, which was often choppy and ill-timed. The fall off the jungle gym and the peeing bits were sloppily constructed. And lest I forget the lack of a musical score. They use the same Italian restaurant cue like three times! And it's massively inappropriate for a film of this nature. You feel like you should ready yourself for some flamenco dancers to enter the frame. Plus the infamous JoBeth Williams moment seemed like a forced laugh that just looked eye-buggingly awkward. Tack on an abrupt ending...the film has its flaws.I think the biggest would be the story's effectiveness. Even placing myself in a 1979 time-frame didn't help, as this didn't have enough punch for a feature film. Hoffman works, cooks, chats, walks the kid to school, gets a lawyer, on and on. It's all too brisk. Performances save it, yes, from being totally dismissed, but undoubtedly is a film that wouldn't have the same impact today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wife (Meryl Streep) walks out on her husband (Dustin Hoffman) and 8 year old son (Justin Henry) after about 9 years of marriage. He learns to cope with bringing up a son on his own and holding down a job. He's helped by a caring neighbor (Jane Alexander) in the same boat. But then his wife returns and she wants full custody of their son...Well-made with excellent acting by everybody. It deals with the subject of divorce and custody rights intelligently (although Hoffman's speech in the courtroom is a bit much). Still I didn't really like this film.For one thing it was WAY overrated in its original release--how this won all those Academy Awards is beyond me. It's also quiet--too quiet. I was getting bored a few times. It doesn't hammer its point at you but is way too subtle. I was never emotionally affected by this at all--I found the movie cold and distant. Also it goes out of its way to make Streep the villain. (Also Hoffman and Streep did NOT get along during the making of this film--it shows--especially during a restaurant scene) It also has an ending that seems awfully rushed and that I didn't buy for one second. Also this all could have been avoided if Hoffman just hired a nanny--God knows he makes enough money!The acting kept me watching but the movie itself is too slow and quiet. Also Jobeth Williams pops up briefly and does a surprisingly explicit nude scene (for a PG movie).I can't really recommend this. I give it a 6 and that's just for the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMHO this movie sucks (possible mild **SPOILERS**).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll first mention some movies I consider to be good so you'll know a bit what's my taste: L.A Confidential, American beauty, Gladiator, Blade Runner, Usual suspects and Forrest Gump.I have nothing particular against Streep or Hoffman. I have seen some of their other work and liked some of it. But I did not like Kramer vs Kramer.Maybe I was born too late (1980) to get this movie or something. I also didn't quite get Easy Rider, though I liked it more than this. But both of these movies somehow felt so.. seventies. It feels a bit like trying to watch a episode of Charlies Angels with a serious attitude. If you think you could do it, then maybe you can also enjoy this movie. Me, I inevitably get this more or less campy feeling. With Charlies Angels it doesn't matter but with Kramer vs. Kramer it really gets on my nerves.This movie felt a lot like Terms of Endearment except IMO this wasn't as good. In ToE there was Nicholson who gave the movie a lot of kick, Kramer vs Kramer felt in comparison really lame.Short synopsis: The movie is about this married couple with 1 kid (a boy) who break up because the guy pretty much dedicates his life to his work. The wife takes a hike but comes back after a while and then they start to bitch &amp; whine about who'll get the kid.Some things that annoyed me: In the beginning of the movie when Teds wife left, why didn't the guy try to hire a nanny or something? This felt annoyingly illogical. Even his boss suggested he should get help. There were also other conflicts that seemed to be more or less made up like this. Ted and his wife never _really_ tried to talk to each other. It felt strange. If this was their relationship how did they ever even get married? Did they perhaps meet in a bar and then it was like "Hi I'm Ted wanna get married with children?" "Mmkay cool."First the movie felt too toothless and soapy, then when the child custody trial begun it turned into this stereotypical ridiculous slandering contest. Too much of the time the movie somehow didn't feel believable or fluent.IMO this movie isn't really worth watching. See Terms of endearment or Sleepless in Seattle instead.</fullReview>
