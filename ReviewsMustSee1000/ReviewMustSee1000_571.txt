		<shortDescription>"Una Vida Sobre Ruedos"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Almodovar's favourite conceits is the use of old TV and movie images as ironic commentary on our modern lives. He loves the sheer trashiness of those millions of hours of low-grade output and he likes to mimic 1950's sitcom formats ("Women On The Verge") or to splice 'quotes' from old footage into his modern tales. It's a device which he uses very effectively in this film. When the gun is fired in the apartment, a shot rings out from the TV set in the corner. The fake news item of the bus birth, in black and white to represent the drabness of Franco's Spain, is a loving recreation of TV's golden age. Women are mannequins in these old TV shows, used by men as objects of prurient displays, and of violence. Our mass media have drugged us, suggests Almodovar, into being passive recipients of authority's handouts. We can no longer distinguish between entertainment and reality. David confronts Victor and wounds him in the testicles, but the two enemies are immediately distracted by the soccer game on TV and become 'guys together', forgetting their hatred in the communal false orgasm of the scored goal. Names are always important in Almodovar films, and in this one they hold the key to the story's many meanings. Elena is Helen of Troy, the creature who radiates unconscious sexual appeal and leads men into war and destruction. Victor Plaza's name contains several layers of symbolic importance. He is the film's real victor, overcoming the misfortune of the shooting and his own sexual imbecility to attain true happiness in America. Many Spanish towns have a 'Plaza de la Victoria', a municipal tribute to the great historical sea triumph of Lepanto. In this sense Victor's name makes him the personification of ordinary Spanish life, a hispanic Everyman. Isabel Plaza Caballero, the prostitute whose wretched short life becomes a saintly image of suffering and continuity, has the name of Spain's great Catholic queen and the title of a 'gentlewoman'. For Almodovar there is no contradiction in a whore having nobility. Sancho is a kind of Sancho Panza to David's Quixote, the latter idealistic but impotent, the former iconoclastic and comical. Almodovar's trademark is the looping circular plot in which the characters both repeat and vary their patterns of behaviour, crossing one another's paths and inadvertently echoing the actions of others. Nowhere is this better illustrated than here. The plot is almost literally circular, beginning and ending with childbirth in a wheeled vehicle, and Victor's life-defining moment hinging on the circular bus ride which brings him back to the identical spot where he started, a payphone on the Calle Eduardo Dato. The characters penetrate one another's lives in ways that are totally convincing, and with a grounding in human psychology which few writers or directors can display. Opposites and contradictions are everywhere. Victor is the prison convict, the sexual inadequate born of a prostitute on a bus, who rises to become an admirable man, sexually proficient, successful, and a loving husband and father. Sancho the macho cop is a spiritual cripple, relying on alcohol to deaden the pain of his failure as a lover. David the real cripple is a national sporting hero. The mother is the whore, the charity director is the heroin addict and the naive lad is the jailbird. The welcome mat on Clara's threshold is the cruellest of ironies. Marriage and sexual coupling are the fabric of the story, but in fact everyone is cuckolded sooner or later. David used to 'service' Clara, now Victor performs that function, and the 'manly' Sancho is sexually redundant. Elena copulates with Victor at the dramatic climax, and we recall that it was a sexual encounter between these two which launched the whole story. It is hard to watch Almodovar's work without thinking of Bunuel. The adolescent preoccupation with the 'obscure object of desire' is a good example. Almodovar is fascinated by the vagina, and over and over again in this film we see men's heads buried between women's legs. Two boy children emerge from wombs, David performs oral sex on Elena in the bath, Victor studies Clara's pudendum, David approaches Elena's genitalia along his wheelchair ramp. The great sloping twin towers of Madrid's Puerta de Europa form an architectural pun, a visual representation of a woman's open thighs. Victor's emotional speech at Isabel's burial site (apart from advancing the plot neatly) is one more image of a man's face in a woman's vagina, the grave being the ultimate womb. This particular vagina brought Victor into the world, and through its immoral earnings it gave him the money to live. The first Christmas in the film, like the First Christmas, happens in a very unpromising setting. It is cold in Madrid in every sense. The final years of Franco's joyless, oppressive reign are conveyed very effectively in a restrained palette of blacks, browns and greys. A state of emergency has been declared by a faceless Authority, grown paranoid about the danger of 'outside influences'. Victor has entered a drab and frightened world, with a bus driver as his reluctant Joseph. By the close of the film Christmas has acquired its cheerful capitalist trappings. This is a 'Christmas in the sun'. Victor is in the young land of freedom and opportunity. He has come of age and is now the complete man. The future looks bright for the New David, father and son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spain, more than most nations, has to deal with its ghosts. The Franco years were a time of enforced stasis, a period when no creativity was allowed to thrive, and progress of any kind was suppressed ruthlessly. A false mentality was imposed on the nation, a communal fantasy looking back in time to a supposedly innocent 'golden age'. Spaniards were forced to see themselves and their culture in terms of Carmens and castanets, fans and fandangos. A people was frozen in time for forty years, and fed on a diet of synthetic movies and novels which summoned up a sexless, crime-free rural idyll, Franco's concept of nationhood. While the West had the Rolling Stones, Spain had troubadors in sombreros. The galloping modernity which has transformed Spanish society in a single generation has given the young adults of today an interesting 'window' on history. While the West has moved smoothly from Sinatra to Sid Vicious, from Marilyn Munroe to Marilyn Manson, Spain has a deep chasm between today and yesterday. Almodovar is intensely concerned with this gap, and his films serve two functions in respect of it. They analyse the social forces which created it (and were spawned by it), and they help Spain to bridge the barranco. It is time now for Spain to move on. When Elena meets Victor for one final date, the purpose of the sexual coupling is to wipe out the guilt which clings to their shared past. New and Old clash on every street corner. We hear a soundtrack of anodyne 'traditional' songs overlaid on scenes of black immigrants doing drug deals. Sancho is a model of old-fashioned manhood who tries, but fails, to castrate the New Man, Victor. The house left to Victor by his mother is out in the northern satellits township of Ventilla, a working-class ghetto of high-rise tenements, Franco's already-rotting 'solution' to Spain's social problems. Cinematically, "Carne Tremula" is second only to "Todo Sobre Mi Madre" as an example of Almodovar's assured command of the film-maker's craft. Transitions are especially well-done. A bus door opens and we see, through the cab, Victor standing, waiting to board. This is the portal of movement opening for Victor, the boy with the gift of lifetime freedom of the buses (symbolically, the 'new' Spaniard, born to a life of movement). Clara remembers her first sexual intercourse, and looks at a photo of herself in First Communion dress. Both events were first communions, both were rites of passage, abandoning the childhood phase. Almodovar moves the action forward from 1980's Madrid to Barcelona in the Olympic Year (1992) by showing the olympic logo on the cycle track, viewed from overhead, as the cyclists cross it. To end Victor's prison sequence, a bus (always his symbol) passes right to left, 'wiping' the prison and revealing the free man. Sancho the housebound husband is re-introduced with power and economy when Clara crosses her own 'welcome' mat to be greeted by him. Fire, earth, ice and water are used as 'gates' in the narrative, marking new beginnings (for example, Clara's frying-pan catches fire because Victor distracts her by announcing the end of the affair). Isabel's waters break on the bus, and we see men in water at moments of 're-birth' (David in the bath, newly secure in the permanence of Elena's love). Stalking is a strong theme, Almodovar inverting and perverting the idea of sexual arousal and pursuit. Voyeurism can be innocent and healthy (young Victor watching Elena in her apartment) but becomes sick when the watcher is impotent and jealous (David filming the Victor-Clara couplings). Victor pursues Elena, even wearing a wolf's head in order to close in on her. Clara is the woman with no sense of direction, whose emotional life is arid. She depends on but does not love the useless Sancho. She loves but cannot possess the sexually potent Victor. The mutual gunning-down of Clara and Sancho is pre-ordained, both in the earlier attempt, and in the shooting by which Sancho launched the narrative. Elena, like many young bourgeois adults, had a heroin phase in her teen years, but has put that behind her and leads a useful and caring life. However, character is fate. She cannot escape the consequences of her sexual union with Victor. The 'final date' is the powerful climax of the film, the fatal destiny to which all of these characters are tending. It speaks volumes of Almodovar's talent that his highly-improbable last reel, with all of the central characters converging on one spot, is entirely believable. In a film predicated on contradictions, David is contradiction personified. The sporting champion with no life in his penis, the good man who cuckolded his friend and partner, the hero of the stand-off in the apartment who becomes the raging jealous spectator on the sidelines, David is both admirable and despicable. His obsession with basketball is psychologically neat - a sublimation of his damaged machismo - and also a devastating revelation. The wheelchairs swoop around the court in a Busby Berkley parody of athleticism, and the ball pops into the basket in clever mimicry of the coitus for which this is David's substitute. And Victor? He is the picaro, the innocent who is always on the move, never comprehending the forces acting upon him, yet never defeated by those forces. His 'life on wheels' is the true life, in contrast with David's sterile life-in-death on wheels. Victor, alone of all the characters, grows because of his suffering. Franco's Spain was static, but Victor has broken free of that prison, and is dynamic. He moves. Thus is he the true victor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar prepared the ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curious, seeing this after the smash hits of "Todo Sobre Mi Madre" and "Hable con Ella", because this movie sort of prepared the viewers to what was coming. Grabbing a solid and original story, Pedro Almodovar creates a movie that revolves around a strange set of characters, and on the process gives an excellent essay on the effect time has on people's lives. All the actors are top notch, specially the commanding Javier Bardem, who would later become an Oscar nominee with "Before Night Falls". Great music, cinematography and direction give this movie an even more satisfying look, and make this a well-achieved movie that ends up being the first part of an unofficial trilogy of Almodovar's best works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodóvar again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Carne Trémula' is another good film from Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. It comes before his great films 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' and 'Hable Con Ella', both more mature than his earlier films, and this film is the beginning of the grown-up Almodóvar. It tells the story of five people with lives that cross paths from time to time. The film starts with Víctor (Liberto Rabal), who has fallen in love with a girl he has only seen once. Her name is Elena (Francesca Neri). She does not remember him, so when he shows up at her house she takes a gun and forces him out of the place. He does not go and because the gun goes off the police arrives a couple of minutes later. Two detectives arrive, David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (José Sancho). They have issues, since Sancho's wife Clara (Ángela Molina) cheats on him, probably with David. Sancho got in a struggle with Víctor, a gun goes off.Four years later David, hit by the bullet, is in a wheelchair and married to Elena. Víctor is released from jail and he has not forgotten about the events years earlier. To tell you what happens would spoil a lot of things since Almodóvar is a master with surprises here. Even in single scenes he makes you think one thing is going to happen and the exact opposite does. It is kind of brilliant.'Carne Trémula' is a film that plays with genres, like Almodóvar's earlier films such as 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' and 'Tacones Lejanos'. It is a comedy, a drama, a detective, a mystery, a romance. In some single scenes it also shows other genres. When the two detectives climb a stairs early in the film there is a typical film noir shot, with shadows and a certain camera movement. Things like this add a lot of fun to the film.Besides this it is also a very well-acted film, especially by the very dependable Bardem. Alfonso Beato provides the film with a gorgeous cinematography and Alberto Iglesias, like always, comes with a score that is beautiful on its own, but also fitting the film in a perfect way. If you like Almodóvar you will definitely like this one, but even if you normally don't there is a good chance this will change your opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mature but not tamed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar has always been the king of kitsch, the naughty, the pervert (who isn't anyway?), the generator of endless dirty language conversations, the good the bad and the ugly of the movie world. Well, he seems to have grown mature, but not tamed in that sense. He probably will be strongly criticized for the oral sex scene, on grounds that he is abusing disabled individuals, just like he was almost damned by feminists because of the looong rape scene in Kika. Well, although he seems to have moved away from his bright colors and chaotic chasing sequences, and although Live Flesh is to the best of my knowledge the first movie where he openly praises the post-Franco era, it was as tasteful as its predecessors. And who can build up such a web of events and relations better than Almodovar does, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Almodovar's drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you intend to see such a film, I warn you that you should not miss any scene if you really want to understand its intelligently arranged plot. Sometimes I see Almodovar as a kind of Victor Hugo of cinema because he makes various complicated scenes not coherently inserted in the film that you should put in order step by step. May be in this way the excitement increases and you will be more anxious to know the end of the film. Javier Bardem (David) played the role of ex-agent and ex-basketball player who was shot in fact accidentally. The Italian actress Francesca Neri is David's wife, and young Liberto Rabal is Victor, the man supposedly spoiling the lives of others, and strong lover. Love and sex scenes of the film are intense as if they were real. The behavior of the actors and actresses in the film is convincingly human, i.e. people having their merits and shortcomings in their lives, there is no fictitious models of behavior. Almodovar, as usual, tries to reflect the reality. There are many good dramas in cinema but this one is probably one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almodóvar seems to be following the rule-"Stick to one thing and do it well." As usual he was able to create great characters and involve good symbolism based on a story which is full of ridiculously impossible coincidences and the sometimes predictable, but always irrational behavior of the characters.As in some of his other films, the story involves characters who seem to be completely led by fate and always bound to their destinies. Each of the characters goes through a radical transformation in a relatively short period of time. In the end, noone is innocent and all are victims, but there is a romantic hope for a brighter future and a new start at life.I liked the new set of actors and actresses that were cast, and I would hope to see them cast differently in another film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mix of elements...Honest cinema...Almodóvar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodóvar changed the way of making cinema in Spain; and doing it, he has impressed movie watchers around the world. You have seen his movies; they are a mix of cruelty that includes honesty and passion. Not honesty in Almodovar's characters, but in the way they are written, showing a tough reality. About passion, well, it occupies a place in every person, but is not always shown; Almodóvar takes care of that.He introduces you to the characters in the story, then he starts to develop a plot that you're going to see, even if it is predictable. Víctor (Liberto Rabal) has lost, or not, his virginity with one woman (older than him). He's not an expert when it comes to casual sex, but she wants to see this woman again, and doesn't understand why she acts like she didn't care what happened. The thing is he doesn't know she does it every week. Then we see David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (José Sancho) working in their car. They are cops. David is honest and professional, Sancho is alcoholic and incontrollable; his wife, Clara (Ángela Molina), cheats him with another man. Sancho loves her, but beats her and keeps her locked in the house. The one who connects them all is Elena. Víctor fights with her, the police arrives, someone is shot and we see a frame that shows the movie some years later. The person who was shot is David, who walks (well, he doesn't walk) in a wheel-chair. David saved Elena's life; they're married. Víctor is getting out of jail; he shot David. Sancho is in the same situation with his wife. Now Víctor is angry, and plans his revenge; eventually he meets Clara, and follows Elena, and everything is connected again, until the end. Javier Bardem is excellent as David. He can cry while he talks and convince you that he is suffering. He is the finest Spanish actor, and it was wonderful to see him fighting against his character's decisions to do the things he has to. Francesca Neri didn't seem Spanish while I was watching the film. She isn't, but she has the looks of a "femme fatally", and that was perfect for her role, which connected everything and had the strongest lines. José Sancho gives a good support as Sancho, reaching the extremes with his face. His character is doomed, because what happens to him now is not going to stop, and the worst part is that he knows it. Ángela Molina doesn't have the chance to shine, but still does a decent work, with what she has got. She can't be having sex with one only man, and she shows it. Liberto Rabal doesn't show much acting talent, he's not the mos experienced in the cast, but somehow, when he talks, he seems not right, but perfect, for his role. Listen to him at the end and you'll see. Almovodar is gifted and he proves it in each frame of this tale. You need to look at every part of the shot to see the details he is giving to the piece. Look at the sexual scenes; the balance he achieves: it's not so strong, but not soft either. It's subtle. His way of directing the actors is amazing. He writes the movie, and knows it more than anyone, so you know he is there to tell the cast what to do, and help them obtain their amazing performances. It's a visual style with life of its own. I said it. There's cruelty and honesty at the same time. There's passion. There's betrayal, lies, sex. You see it in the characters, in their words. When David arrives home and sees his wife Elena in bed, and starts to touch her; she doesn't like it. "What's the matter?", he asks. "It hurts", Elena answers. "Why?", he says. And with a face that involves everything I'm talking about, she looks at him: "Because I've been having sex all night"</fullReview>

The conflicts between love and lust, guilt and innocence, love and sympathy, trust and control, an old, dark and cynical police state of Spain and a brave, outspoken and contemporary Spain??all fused into a melting pot of a heart-throbbing and colourful romance thriller.

		<fullReview>Almodovar at least does two things for me.?He touches on deep stuff without pretending that he has to do so in a story. Thus he avoids moralizing and is able to maintain all sorts of ambiguities and overlaps between different parts of the world. Oh, there's always a story, but they are so soap opera-ish and delivered so jauntily that they actually separate from the movie.?He does everything cinematically. He really has an eye that is a treasure. Every element of what we see, WE SEE. It isn't explained. It isn't in dialog that we happen to overhear, we see it. Not only does he use a cinematic vocabulary to deliver the main goods, but similar devices are used to show us that it is a layered structure.He mixes television (in several modes), old movies, and out of body narrative. Often dreams and visions. Paintings, photographs and postcards and in this case an imagined ending (after "Taxi Drviver). Often one or more characters is a generator of public stories; here it is a wounded cop who becomes a wheelchair basketball star.He's not my favorite Spaniard, and this isn't my most valued of his films. But its hard to better than any visit from Pedro.Its an honestly vaginal world (with the connection among several layers being there) and I suppose therefore most women will actually think the story matters.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About A Single Gunshot And Attack To Mainstream Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Live Flesh or Carne Trémula in Espanol is a Spanish romantic drama thriller film that is written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.It stars Liberto Rabal, Javier Bardem, and Francesca Neri. The film is loosely based on Ruth Rendell's book entitled Live Flesh.Live Flesh examines how several lives are changed by a single gunshot. Adapting the novel by Rendell, Almodóvar has given the material a Spanish makeover with added political thrust. Beginning in 1970 in Franco's Madrid, when a prostitute gives birth to a son, Victor, the story leaps forward to contemporary Madrid. Wealthy diplomat's daughter Elena is watching Luis Bu?uel's The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de La Cruz while waiting for the arrival of her heroin dealer, and she buzzes Victor,whom she had a one-night stand,into the building. In the confusion that follows, two cops, David and Sancho arrive, and a gun goes off. The story then makes another leap to four years later: Victor is in prison, while Elena, no longer on drugs, runs a disadvantaged children's shelter and is married to wheelchair-bound David. After his release, Victor visits his mother's grave and spots David and Elena at the cemetery -- where David meets philandering wife Clara (Angela Molina). Fate interweaves the tangled interrelationships of all into a complex tapestry of destiny and guilt.Live Flesh is definitely enigmatic as this implausible story with unbelievable twists and turns definitely provides nothing more but mystery and entertainment to the viewer.Despite of its great cinematography,the film basically tries to deviate itself from the common films shown in cinema.But nevertheless,Almodóvar triumphs as he manages to amaze the viewer with his so-called "tricks" as outrageous occurrences feels like realistic.Overall,it become a movie that attacks the mainstream by without any elements of a mainstream feature and it succeeds!!!</fullReview>

Bulgarian is not common language that any people who know few languages would understand what he is saying.So 99% of the people who watch it don't know Bulgarian.That means they don't have to understand details. Like most of the Spanish movies I have watched, it has sexuality on it. The problems that people might get in their lives spontaneously.

		<shortDescription>A darker, more serious Almodovar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A maturing Almodovar in a less absurd - if still melodramatic - mode than his early films. This time the tone is more film noir/mystery/character study. Unlike most of the early work, this is generally 'serious', with just touches of his humor. Visual very striking and dark. Wonderful performances, including an early one by Javier Bardem. I appreciate how all the characters are gray, no one is 'good' or bad'. Basically it's a love triangle with multiple angles, and a cop drama about violence and love. What it's missing (for me at least) , and keeps it a very good film, not a great one, is deeper levels of emotion. It's always interesting, but I didn't ultimately find it affecting. Also a couple of key plot contrivances are clunky ? which the anarchic young Almodovar could get away with, since everything was absurd anyway. But when you're being more 'real', forced twists feel more? well, forced. Still a film well worth seeing, and another important step in the growth of a major filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Aldomovar is seen as a real genius and personally I think that one film is better than the other but this movie from 1997 certainly belong to the best the Spanish infant terrible has made. In 1970 a woman bears a child in a bus and it's that boy, Victor (Liberto Rabal), who we are going to follow. Victor is an ordinary guy but due to circumstances his whole life will be twisted up as he's the victim from two policemen who are arguing. Like so many other movies by Aldomovar it would be a real spoiler to reveal things as the magic of the movie is to be found in its surprising storytelling that at first doesn't make that much sense but develops itself into a perfect, surprising story. Aldomovar is becoming the master of telling the little things in life and it's in that we can found so much beauty. Also nice to see Penelope Cruz as special guest star, even if she's in it for about 5 minutes. "Live Flesh" certainly is one of Aldomovar's easier movies as for once he gives all the answer even if you have to wait till the end of the movie. A tip!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>live flesh is a story of true love, redemption and acceptance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey there everyone,"live flesh" is one of those fine movies which go through your mind days after the movie. Like all Almodovar's movies, this one also features desperate characters who cope with loneliness. Picture Victor, a young street kid who falls in love with a ravishingly beautiful woman (The Italian Francesca Neri) after a one night stand in a disco bathroom. He calls her and she rejects him in a mean, cold hearted way. What Victor doesn't know, is that Elena is actually a drug addict. Victor goes to her apartment for an explanation. There he gets entangled in a weird shooting accident with two cops, which leaves him in jail for seven years and a cop paralyzed. This cop (a young Javier Bardem) becomes a paralympics star and weds Elena. After his jail time Victor returns for Elena, but things have changed. Both David and Elena fear Victor, but he has no bad intentions. Even though Victor does try to get mingled back into the life of his former love. Victor also becomes involved with the other cop's (Sancho) wife and she (Clara) starts to fall in love with him. Victor and Clara make out constantly, but Victor stays in love with Elena. He finally confronts Elena about the injustices done to him in the past and her crucial role in it. He knows to seduce her for a one night and vows to never see her again. He dumps Clara later on, leaving her in tears. In agony she finally has to courage to escape her drunken husbands and his domestic beatings. Sancho (after a tip from jealous David) and Clara meet each other at Victor's house, which again leads to a shoot out. This time Victor escapes painful consequences. Elena runs to the house, hearing gunshots and screams out her love for Victor. Victor and Elena are reunited after 7 years and get a baby. This time things will turn out right for Victor. Spain has become a free country and his son will have a better future. In all of Almodovar's movies the characters are nice to watch (both in acting and appearance). The color use is always good and adds to the atmosphere of an intimate story. And if you don't like the story... Just check out the movie pure for the beautiful blue eyes of Francesca Neri. They express both a beautiful soul and an agonizing spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justice and love- a flammable mixture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Almodovar movie and I was impressed. Not only was the story satisfying- lots of twists and turns, the actor who played Victor was both sexy and vulnerable. The sub-plots of adultery and jealousy work well with the main plot of a man pursuing an impossible love. I liked the frantic pace of the first scene, the humor of his birth and the justice of the ending. Everyone in this ensemble adds something- from the troubled partner to the lovestarved wife. The only drawback is the video version destroys the beauty of the passionate love scene-- see it on big screen if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly erotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Somos un sue?o impossible' sings with her deep and almost inhuman voice Chavela Vargas in Almodovar's film `Carne Tremula'. And this is what this film is all about: a love story, which reaches and overcomes the limits of an impossible dream.Almodovar, based on Ruth Rebel's novel, creates an imposing, intense film in his own, familiar to us, magical way. The film evolves and revolves around the lives, passions, almost Freudian eroticism and weaknesses of five different (or so they seem) people. The main protagonist is deeply in love with Helena and after a fight in her apartment he is accused of shooting one of the police officers that arrived to `rescue' Helena. Victor is sentenced to six years in prison. When he completes his sentence he finds out that Helena is married to the police officer he was accused of shooting. Victor is having an affair with the abused and desperate wife of the second police officer in order to come closer to Helena. How will all the characters react and interact with Victor's invasion in their lives?Almodovar brings the characters together, messes their lives, crosses their paths in his own magnificent way. The way that the characters meet, react and interact is based on the principle of coincidence, which hardly is happening by mere luck. On the contrary, the coincidences seem so delicately directed and calculated that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to suggest that the reach the limits of genius.However, if the primary principle upon the film is based on and evolves around is coincidence, then the second principle should be sexuality and eroticism. The whole film is diffused with intense and deep eroticism. More specifically, images of naked flesh are the primary target of Almodovar's camera. However, the direction is erotic without a trace of vulgarity. The Carne Tremula (Live Flesh in its English translation) appears throughout the film aroused, with powerful hot and warm colours like yellow, orange and red -colours that one feels that they have taken over the whole picture throughout the movie-. In addition, Flesh appears not simply as a material of which humans are made of but also as a projection of people's feelings and desires, as an extension of the inner self. The Flesh is presented so alive as if it has a mind of its own. It is presented warm and wavy, it moves and it comes together in a symmetrical, rhythmic but yet natural way. Moreover, whatever it is enclosed within the Flesh's periphery is following its erotic dance with the same colours, movements and breaths.Almodovar is creating the profiles of five people, who look so different but then again they are developed on the same basis. All of the characters are moved by one and single thing: their strong, unshakeable and nonnegotiable desire to find and experience love. A love, nevertheless, unspoken, as it is only verbalized by the expression of the Flesh, the intense magnetizisation of two different Fleshes breathing the same air. All of the characters desperately struggle to maintain their other half whichever the means. In this way, the Flesh takes over the Mind and their desire for love becomes an obsession, a sicken passion which destroys their lives. There's no sense of logic and reality when the passion takes over. Feelings are being over-dramatized and the script focuses on the human relationships. Everyone betrays and is being betrayed. And that's exactly what Almodovar wants to highlight. Is it love a desperate voice of fear and loneliness or is it the absolute enosis of the Live Flesh?When Victor says to Clara that their affair should come to an end she cries out `Please, don't leave me, I won't ask you anything, just let me love you.' The language used in the film is an unshameless and graceful manifest to the human eroticism. This particular modern, everyday language comes in contrast to the non-vulgar and sensual love scenes and even to the traditional erotic Spanish music.Once more, Almodovar highlights the role of the feminine -a characteristic that is present, apparent and obvious to the majority of his films-, as the whole world seems to unfurl around women. In this movie Flesh is certainly a feminine representation. Moreover, men's actions emphasize women's personalities and characteristics.The actors fall easily and willingfully into the director's `trap' and follow him to an endless dance of eroticism and passion. Javier Bardem shows excellent moments of talent which are going to certified on his later role choices (including the magnificent Before the Night Falls of Julian Schanabel, in 2000, which brought him broader recognition and many awards.) Liberto Rabal, from the other hand, represents the typical male, almost iconic model, of an Almodovar film, representing fittingly every woman's ( or man's one could suggest) fantasy.The desperate scream of the protagonists is identified with the tragic lyrics of the main song of the film `Somos un sue?o impossible'. We are an impossible dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film whose plot intrigues to nearly an excessive extent, but you can't complain of mild-overcomplexity when films are so often void of this quality. As the the film progresses, by surprising plot-driven action rather than as the natural reactions of characters whom the viewer 'understands', sex is presented as the source of all love, desire, angst and jealousy. Madrid is portrayed in beautiful cityscape shots, and the cinematography is awesome in its exploration of the characters as well. In all, a stunning film, with more emphasis on plot than characters, but that does not demean the value of its ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Amoldovar's 'Live Flesh' is a stylish, original and watchable revenge-thriller, featuring not just a love triangle, but a love pentagon; moreover, one of the participants is that rare creation, a disabled character who inspires envy not pity. But there isn't too much substance beneath the surface: all the leading figures are gorgeous without being lovable, and while the central sex scene is certainly quite erotic, I don't imagine you'd see anything quite so arousing by sticking a camera in any real couple's bedroom. There is one theme behind the story, which is brought forward in the conclusion of the movie, and that is the changing face of Spain over the last quarter of the twentieth century; but the connection of this idea to the plot is slight. Overall, it's a film with interesting parts, but their sum is a little underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subdued Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are too many thrillers that want to be sexy and dramatic and stylish and smart, but with great disappointment, those "ands" turn into italicized "ors", as few artistic talents are capable of such an intricate juggling act. One too many Basic Instincts walk out the door all dressed down in crotchless interrogations with little value to be held in the long run. Some directors are so self-conscious that they feel the need to grab a megaphone and loudly inform us that, that's right, they are aiming to be sexy and dramatic and stylish and smart. If only those damn "ors" would get out of the way for once.Few filmmakers, however, have the gutsy panache of Pedro Almodóvar, who possibly was the result of a lab experiment involving Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, Brian De Palma, and the wardrobe of Endora from Bewitched. His films range from candy colored to smokily noiry, sometimes carrying the weight of a Technicolor Bringing Up Baby or a severely darkened vintage women's picture. Though slightly flagrant, his projects maintain the professionalism of an auteur who simply knows what the hell he's doing.Take a film like Live Flesh, which isn't quite sexy enough, soapy enough, violent enough, yet still manages to feel distinctly, no pun-intended, fleshed out. It's subdued, but it's carefully subdued. If we had the same old X-rated Sirk stuff like usual, we'd surely be tripping in a David LaChapelle styled hallucination. This time around, Almodóvar fabricates a complicated story of revenge, steamy trysts and deadly misunderstandings that hit all the right notes, even if those notes are all sharped and flatted; yet, it's his most mature film.The movie begins in 1970 with a theatrical birth in the back of a city bus; being welcomed into the world is Victor Plaza, the son of a prostitute (Penélope Cruz). Jump 20 years into the future: Victor (Liberto Rabal) is meeting Elena (Francesca Neri), a drug addict, for an impromptu date after hooking up a week previously. Elena was in the mood for a one-night stand, not a courtship ? when Victor shows up to her apartment, she flies into a rage, threatening to shoot him in a fashion only Loretta Young could top. They get into a scuffle, leaving Elena unconscious while the gun flies out of her hands and accidentally fires.The downstairs neighbor hears, and, concerned, calls the police. The cops who arrive, the alcoholic, reckless Sancho (Jose Sancho) and the more proper David (Javier Bardem) attempt to calm the scene. Cut to yet another scuffle, David is shot in the back, paralyzed, while Victor is sent to prison for the next four years. But when he is released, he finds that David and Elena have married, leading to a series of events that could only be found in a classy telenovela.No matter how breathy and melodramatically enhanced the plot may at first sound, it is surely one of Almodóvar's most toned down films, both in terms of style and personality. Gone are the neons, artificial sets and delightfully wacky side-characters; gone is the tongue-in-cheek restlessness that made his films better-than-average Hollywood homages that were far too good to simply be called homages. In Live Flesh, you take him seriously, viewing him as a director who has had plenty of fun in the past but wants to make something as substantial as his peers. Looking back, the film marked a turn in his career, shifting towards heavyweights like All About My Mother in 1999 and Talk to Her in 2002.Not to suggest that Live Flesh is sapped of any pleasures. The storyline is pleasingly hammy, with touches of unexpected realisms like wheelchair basketball and domestic abuse, and the performances are finely tuned. Even better is the cinematography (clearly influenced by Almodóvar himself), which hangs onto the bodies of the actors like a fixated Michelangelo; whether they're silhouetted, in the nude, or clothed in cheetah prints, there is an added lustiness that heightens the frequent sexual tensions the film constantly revisits. Live Flesh is a sumptuously shot throwback of a romantic thriller, evidence of a director with pop arted ambitions taking a risky turn that pays off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well orchestrated melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Pedro Almodovar movie was the second film ? after The Flower of My Secret ? where he toned things down and went for a more serious approach. Having said that, it's still very much a melodrama. Its story is simultaneously simple and complex. It basically is about how one gunshot changes the lives of five people. It starts out appearing one way but as we get to know the participants we discover their differing motivations on that fateful night. Everyone seems to be suffering because of the actions of another. Every character is a shade of grey, no one is innocent and the film is about guilt and redemption as much as anything. Once you think back on the story you only then realise how complex a web of deceit and betrayal has been woven by all of the participants. Some have also mentioned that it is an allegorical story about Spain's recent history. While there is an interesting opening segment set in 1970 in Franco's regime, I honestly couldn't tell you what the allegory actually is. Maybe it's a cultural thing or perhaps I'm just too dumb to have noticed. But regardless of this, Live Flesh can easily be appreciated without this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrown Into the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar is a Spanish director known for his fast-paced stories about prostitution, homosexuality, femininity in masculinity and a bunch of other taboos. He often deals with relation between men and women, sexuality and the different manifestations of it. He ironically studies his own culture, which is strongly masculine. He has given us a lot of satirical portrayals, amazing stories and taught us about the beauty in difference. Almodovar started by making short films in 1970's but moved to full length features in the 80's. In 1990's he was highly appreciated in the world of cinema and in 1997 he brought us a new growth story Live Flesh.In 1970's a woman gives birth to a boy in a vacant bus: at the very same night the boy is named Victor and he is granted the ability of traveling via Spanish buses free of charge. 20 years later Victor meets a woman, who couldn't be less interested in him; still Victor cannot get her out of his mind. A series of events and coincidence lead the characters to their own paths, which walk into each other as time goes by.Pedro Almodovar has never been my number one personal favorite, but I've always enjoyed his films: he is a very good storyteller plus his films are hilarious portrayals of the macho-society. The greatest thing in his work is the fact that he has been going up all the time. Film by film he has outdone himself. After Live Flesh he made All About My Mother and Talk to Her, both of which are amazing films and I consider the latter to be his true masterpiece.With regards to the philosophy of film in the work of Almodovar, I see existentialism behind it. His characters are often prostitutes, poor youngsters, people who haven't planned their lives, people who haven't planned to become prostitutes. There is no destiny that guides them. Just as in the films by Eric Rohmer in Almodovar's the events build around coincidence and everything is led by it. All that happens, happens because of coincidence or the minor choices by the characters. Such as David getting into the accident and falling in love with Elena, because of Victor's choice.The existentialism in Almodovar's films is especially from Jean-Paul Sartre. He was a French atheist existentialist who took a lot of influence from Kierkegaard and Heidegger for instance. Sartre said that man is just thrown into this world and by one's actions and choices defines one's own existence. "Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. It is up to you to give life a meaning."Live Flesh is basically a growth story - the growth story of Victor, from his birth to his twenties and the film particularly portrays the growth of his love. Live Flesh is a film, which is both funny and sad, bitter and sweet. It's about love and the yearning of it: a timeless film about love to cut a long story short. The film includes some hilarious ironic descriptions of Spanish men. It works very well just as it is but it is quite interesting to look below the surface: into the philosophy of film and intricate themes and taboos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Time Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar has a distinct style of story-telling and character development. This is visible from the first scene of the movie itself where we see the birth of one of the characters in a public transport bus. For some, this scene may have no relevance to the behavior of the character or how the story shapes up, but still the scene is pretty much there. The rest of the movie is also filled with some unique scenes and developments which make the movie very much different from average thrillers. For example, there is a scene where two of the protagonists are face to face fighting each other with vengeance but suddenly stop and cheer together because their favorite player scores a goal. The plot is pretty average, but the direction and the actor's performances has enhanced it. Watch out for the aesthetically shot sex scenes as well. Javier Bardem is good playing a handicap and a passionate man. Liberto Rabal steals the show though with different shades to portray. Not one of Almodovar's best, but still an average watch.Rating : 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about Almodovar's movies that is so arresting, so captivating. Maybe it's the colour - his leading ladies always seem to wear red. So many visually stunning scenes, particularly the one where Elena is in bed with Victor. No salacious treatment here, just beautiful classy cinematography. The storyline is good, but it's the camerawork that is so beautiful. Almodovar sees beauty and captures it like no-one else. His use of colour, black, red and yellow... coincidentally, the colours of the Spanish flag - or maybe it's no conincidence.The opening scenes with Penelope Cruz are superb. I've never seen childbirth depicted so realistically. Being used to a diet of English and American movies, it is so refreshing to see movies that are exciting and visually stimulating. Minimal violence, but so much humanity and sensuality. This movie was a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victor, the son of a prostitute, tries to hook up with Elena, a druggie with whom he'd had a previous tryst (his first). She resists, the cops are called, and there's a standoff between Victor and policemen David and Sancho. There's a struggle, and a gun is fired, leaving David paralyzed and sending Victor to jail.When Victor gets out of jail, his mind is on bitter revenge, especially after he discovers that Elena, now clean and sober, has married the invalid David, who's now a paralympic basketball star. Victor gets a job working at the orphanage funded and operated by Elena (but he's not stalking her, no) and begins to romance Clara, the battered wife of Sancho.Each of the five characters, unavoidably intertwined, is complex and morally ambiguous. What are Victor's true intentions? What, even more importantly, are his capabilities? Is Sancho properly haunted by his treatment of Clara and of that fateful night that brought him, David, and Victor together? If Clara does leave Sancho, where will she turn - or is she simply another turn-the-cheek spouse? Does David have a sense of moral superiority because he no longer has use of his lower limbs and therefore has suffered more than most people? And which is stronger, Elena's lust or her loyalty? The quintet, whose lives were forever changed that one night, find themselves drawn back together in a web of intrigue of their own design. All of the actors are fantastic, particularly Francesca Neri, as Elena, and Liberto Rabal, as Victor. The on screen chemistry among all five leads is palpable; no one feels they were just dropped into the movie indiscriminately. Pedro Almodovar's complicated tale is never preachy, and none of the characters are stereotypical. Not all cops are noble, not all drug addicts are irredeemable, not all orphanage operators are perfect, and not all criminals are despicable. Pretty obvious stuff in the real world, but in the land of movies characters are typically painted with as broad a brush as possible in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. The movie is tense without veering toward melodrama, and although it begins rather slowly, the final twenty minutes or so are unsettling, nerve-wracking suspense. I defy you to sit complacently while Elena approaches Victor's barrio apartment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not Almodovar's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Live Flesh belongs to a trilogy of Almodovar films which also includes Talk to Her &amp; All About My Mother. All three are circular films which involve the rearrangement of characters' lives &amp; relationships. The plot device to motivate this rearrangement in all three films is a tragedy. All three films also rely heavily on coincidence.I thought the film was good, but it didn't quite "draw me in" to the extent of the other two. But clearly, the groundwork is being laid for Talk to Her, Almodovar's most accomplished film.In general, I liked the performances, but I felt the actor who played Victor was a little too young for the part. Though he is exceedingly easy on the eyes, he didn't quite have the charisma that Banderas demonstrated in Tie Me Up (a very similar character in an earlier Almodovar film). Subsequently, that affected my connection with Victor as a protagonist. He was a little too boy-ish (supposed to be 28), and I wasn't entirely convinced that he has spent 7 years in the slammer. He seemed a little too unaffected, contrary to innocent/obsessed edgy role Banderas nailed in Tie Me Up.But these are personal opinions, and the film is necessary to fully appreciate its companion pieces. It doesn't achieve the homage to campy women's melodrama of All About My Mother, nor the perfect poetry &amp; cinematic genius of Talk to Her, but still worth your time.</fullReview>

The description of the characters (not the characters in themselves) is very simple. Javier Bardem does not convince as the main character, Liberto Rabal makes an almost correct performance (but nothing else), and some situations (the TV goal scene after Javier Bardem punching Liberto Rabal) are so unrealistic that they look inopportunely comic.

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, Cruz is not long in this film. She is a prostitute who give birth on a bus. The story is really about her son, whom we join 20 years later.Now, hang on. Victor (Liberto Rabal), her son, is infatuated with Elena (Italian beauty Francesca Neri), but she is just a junkie who is more interested in seeing her dealer than him. They scuffle and the police (David and Sancho) come. Sancho's wife is fooling around, so he is drunk and gets into a fight with Victor and a gun goes off injuring David. David (Javier Bardem) heads off to a life of wheelchair basketball and marriage to Elena. Victor goes to jail. When he gets out, he takes up with Clara (Ángela Molina), Sancho's wife.If you are not confused yet, it gets more interesting as secrets are exposed. Pedro Almodóvar has written and directed another interesting film. It ends just as it begins, but in a dig at the repressive Franco regime, with a nod to freedom.It is a comedy, a detective story, a thriller, a drama - a bit of everything. - An Almodóvar paella for the eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almodovar is a master story writer--he knows exactly what to tell the viewer and when to tell it. He understands the volatile nature of the film medium, preferring to illustrate the motives of his characters rather than simply state them. As in "Todo Sobre mi Madre" and "Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios," Almodovar uses subtler methods than others to draw attention to important details. The movie holds together like an artfully composed opus, returning to hints given earlier on and embellishing on them. In this way Almodovar will definitely mess with your mind; by the end of the movie your judgments on the characters will make a total about-face.However, the first time viewer should be warned not to take the circumstances too seriously. Almodovar's plots thrive on unlikely circumstances and chance meetings of characters. It is something more akin to the magical realism in literature, not to be taken literally.</fullReview>

Great story, Almodovar style, a different perspective of Madrid, great acting, but Liberto Rabal stands out amongst all of it. Very tasty indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like most of Almodovar's movie, Great music, nice cinematography and strange plot and roles make up this movie. Though victor suffered a lot since his born moment, he still cherished his kindness. It is not surprising the two women fell in love with him. He deserved the end after those hardship. And the two policemen also got what they deserve. However, I feel a little bit sorry for Clara, who was dead long ago in spirit. She was prisoned by his husband with whom she had no feeling at all. She died for Victor who was her best love. I was really moved when she picked up the book and saw Victor as a little child in the picture which She kissed goodbye to. She loved all of him, from the time he was born. Anyway, they used to have a good time together. Almodovar is good at presenting conflicts in society. like the trailer says: all the desires, jealousy, lust and obsession made our lives with living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I thought the movie, Live Flesh, was eye opening and was awakening. I think the title speaks of the act of extra-martial affairs in marriage relationships.The movie demonstrates what can happen when people get into bad marriages, and when people look around for other women/men in relationships. The gun shot clearly changes the one man's life and his wife couldn't deal with it. The most scary part is that it comes across as a somewhat real story. So lust and desire interfere with the relationships and tempers rise. The movie demonstrates the end of the wedding vows. The young kid, who tried to break people up, didn't know anything and he obviously wasn't very mature. He's lucky he didn't get shot himself. Also, Almodovar does a nice job of mixing in classical music to add drama to the scene. He does very well in adding Spanish style to the novel based movie.The story is actually something you see repeated in Hollywood. So I believe the movie expresses some of the behaviour of people in everyday life. I would recommend viewing the movie. I think it relates to the Spanish couple in Desperate Housewives. However, there is more violence and realism when one considers how the characters are going to interact when presented with this situation. I would rate it better than the television series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another overstuffed and convoluted vivacious mess from that oft-adored consummately colorful artiste from Spain, Aldmodovar. I'm not quite certain why he felt compelled to include a political prologue and epilogue to what is a melodrama with a sliver of social commentary. Typically, the performances are impassioned and committed, especially Bardem who foreshadows his miraculous wooden turn in "Te Sea Inside." However, what mostly troubled me is Aldmodovar's salacious yearning to portray the men as unworthy of these delectable yet self-righteous femme fatales. Admirable as it may be to avoid such seemingly obvious scenes that display evidence of spousal abuse, Almodovar's alignment with the piously important 'Rabal' smacks more of his selfish sexual longing than out of narrative obligation. That being said, who could avoid feeling longing when such fine physical specimens are shot with such desirable yummyness. My goodness, am I envious of the Spanish skin tone. Both the characterizations and narrative plotting are strongest from the late 1st act through the end of the second. The rest is all a bit far-fetched and trying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just finished watching and rushed to IMDb to comment. I like the earlier humorous films of Almodovar more and I am a big fan of his.I am deeply moved by this film. As always, a film with heart and flame, a film that needs no plot fillers or desperate explanations of 'why's this' and 'why's that'. Almodovar films don't need to be believed. Few or none of his films are believable. But that's not the case with this great artist. By watching one of his films, you simply surrender to his world and become a part of it. If not, then you're propably not reading this right now. This film is big. Very big.Even those who dislike the humorous Almodovar might like some or all of his late films. This one, touched me also in the subject matter, monogamy - lust - faith - happiness. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar's Most Lovably Absurd Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar's films have evolved quite nicely within the confines of certain persistent themes: sex, death, women. He's rather well known for exercising these themes withing a strangely plausible completely implausible plot (she married the paraplegic basketball star policeman a "lover" of hers accidentally shot). Of the Almodovar films I've seen, he applies his themes in the most humorous, but not lighthearted way imaginable, so that the viewer is aware that he is watching something totally ridiculous, but seems inclined to want to believe it. That's how I see it anyway. Props to Fransesca Neri for her superb acting. The other actors do well, but she shone in that special "chosen" way Alomodovar gets his lead actresses to shine. Now GO WATCH "All About My Mother!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Live Flash": All Almodovar's cliches in a blender...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar's "Live Flesh" (Carne Tremula) is a very solid movie, probably the most solid and mature screenplay of this original Spanish filmmaker.The only thing that may disappoint viewers, specially those familiar with his work, is the fact that "Live Flesh" seems to feed off his previous work. Parts of the film seem to be directly extracted from "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down" (Atame), "Women at the verge..." (Mujeres...), and many others. Half way through the movie I had the feeling I was watching "Tie me up, tie me down" all over again. As a matter of fact the characters of Victor and Ricky are almost the same! Unfortunately, Liberto Rabal is not even half the actor that Antonio Banderas can be. At times it felt Mr. Rabal was just reading his lines without passion. On the other hand, Javier Bardem, Pepe Sancho, and Angela Molina do a pretty decent job, as it's expected from such reliable actors.Other than that, the movie is pretty entertaining and the plot keeps you on your toes. The author has definitely improved the suspense in the screenplay, as compared to his early work. If I didn't see "Atame," this flick would be my favorite Almodovar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, some of the acting is bad and the plot is totally unbelievable...but I consider it one of Almodovar's best films. Somehow he makes the characters and situations realistic...every time I see it I totally forget how silly the basic plot is and get caught up in the story. It's to Almodovar's credit that he gets this to work. The only weak point is the acting by the leading man--he plays Victor. He is handsome, has a good body and does a nice full frontal nude shot--but he's a lousy actor. Still, it doesn't hurt the film too much. Beautiful direction, some really good performances and a plot full of twists and turns and absurdity. It all leads up to a happy ending. Never a dull moment! Well worth seeing. IMO, Almodovar's best movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalker and prey live happily ever after</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor is a proletarian guy, born on bus by a mother working as a prostitute (shown in an overlong introduction and pointless to the rest of the movie) who falls for Elena, an upper class junkie. Actually, he just has casual sex with her once and becomes erotically obsessed with her.He stalks her to her apartment and stubbornly refuses to leave her alone. A fight ensues and Sancho and David, a couple of cops appear on the scene. David gets paralyzed by a gunshot and ends up married to Elena.Victor gets to jail, but he is still obsessed with Elena and continues stalking her once he gets out four years later. Already unconvincing, the story takes a turn for the absurd when Elena shows a growing interest for Victor, who continues to confuse obsession with love.In the meantime, Victor is also sexually involved with Clara, Sancho's wife (very believable plot twist). Clara is giving him lessons to become the best lover in the world, Victor's top ambition so as to astonish Elena with his performance. It sounds like a demented plot, but I am not making it up.Probably one of the weakest Almodovar's films, it contains the inevitable steamy sex scene, which are Almodovar trademark and it is disgraced even further by an absurd "happy ending", which sees stalker and prey happily together, while Elena is giving birth to their child on a car (back to the start, in a sort of circular move).P.S. to make the matter worse, throughout the whole movie Victor blames Elena, David and everybody else for his misfortunes, conveniently avoiding to notice that the whole drama arose from his obsession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unintelligent melodrama shouldn't be viewed as such. It's a pure parabola, reflecting Spain coming out of modern dark ages, acknowledging its wounds and sicknesses.And sicknesses they are indeed. No character in this film deserves sympathy. The hero is dumb, the wives are skankish, the husbands are treacherous and double faced.Almodovar, however, makes a big but hard-to-spot mistake in an attempt to force us to care. "Here they are", he shouts, "With their visceral problems, and here they are trying their best in coming out of it!!" The real "trouble" of the film is that they are NOT solving anything by sinking even deeper into fever. They look in each other's eyes and repeatedly ask the same question: "What?" Not once throughout the whole movie has the most important question been asked -- "Why?!" Why, god damn it, and that's the question every one of them should ask, first themselves in a mirror, and then each other.But, my friends, here's the key -- none of these characters is alive. They are walking problems, not people -- problems not of everyday folk, but of the society that agonizes over something no normal human being would drop a tear for. They are ghosts, and when, as in a cheep ghost movie, a hero finally meets one and wants to ask "How?' he is treated with irrational behavior of the said ghost -- this way the plot surgically avoids those juicy complications an intelligent moviegoer truly craves for. Almodovar leaves the analysis of motives to us, hoping, no ... knowing that we'd understand. I did and realized that the characters were shells, empty inside.My opinion has been repeatedly crucified by Almodovar's fans among my friends who always bring one last argument -- the movie is wonderfully unpredictable. Indeed, irrational behavior can be unpredictable. Almost as easy, I guess, as dumb choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetition and Destiny Meet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If with LA FLOR DE MI SECRETO Pedro Almodovar seemed to tell the world he was done with his garish style and was ready to explore more mature themes. While not many people were happy with his decision, it was inevitable: sooner or later every director has to make a choice and explore less traveled paths with the risk of failing or succeeding. Almodovar's next project, a Ruth Rendell novel called "Live Flesh", was as removed from his trademark style as it was dark: an incursion into the crime genre that explored the nature of intertwined destinies locked in a prolonged dance of seduction, consuming passions, death, and ultimate redemption, neatly presented as a clichéd love quadrangle. While the events of CARNE TREMULA can't be taken as serious, being the elements of every other pot-boiler drenched in atmosphere and melodramatic suspense, Almodovar has that extra touch that differentiates him from the mass. He transposes Rendell's sordid story into a conflicted country and imbues the story's passions with a very Spanish flavour: truthfully, this is the first movie in which the masculine is a driving force and women are subjugated into "being there" and acting upon request. A classic example of masculine energy acting upon its nature is a scene in which Javier Bardem and Liberto Rabal, antagonists competing for the love of a woman (Francesca Neri), exchange blows... but pause to watch their country's soccer team score, only to resume their positions of alpha males warring against each other. But more significantly, masculine passion plays a much more profound aspect in driving the events of CARNE TREMULA in the scene where detective Bardem and his partner Jose Sancho arrive to respond to a crime scene (which involves Neri and Rabal) while being in the middle of a misunderstanding. Sancho believes Bardem is having an affair with his wife, played by Angela Molina (she of Luis Bunuel's THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE). When they break into Neri's apartment (after a gun goes off while Neri's television plays a key scene in Luis Bunuel's ENSAYO DE UN CRIMEN -- a brilliant combination of life imitating the sordid), Sancho and Bardem bring Rabal into submission, but Sancho decides to use that moment to fire the fateful shot against his own partner and lay the blame on Rabal. From then on, it's a game between these three men who will be tied together by this very scene and will be, like the characters in Bunuel's own 1955 classic, doomed to clash again, with disastrous results. In many ways, CARNE TREMULA can be interpreted as a clash of bulls fighting for the infanta whom they love (or believe they love) and is a welcome departure from his more female-oriented melodramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense delivery easily covers the stretches in the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had sex with Elena the week before, Victor returns to her flat to try and see her again. However Elena was high when it happened and has no memory of it and no interest in refreshing her memory, but when Victor refuses to leave they start to fight and Elena pulls a gun, which goes off when Victor knocks it away. The police are called and David and his bitter, drunkard partner Sancho respond. A struggle ensues after a brief standoff and while Victor and Sancho wrestle on the floor, the gun goes off and David is hit. Four years later Victor is released from prison, David is in a wheelchair and has married a clean Elena while Sancho is still trying to keep his relationship with wife Carla together. Victor's release brings these individuals back into contact and unleashes the emotions of that night again.Having just watched Volver and found it to be slightly below the standards of many of Almodóvar's other films, I decide to revisit Live Flesh. Aside from the opening cliché, this film is mostly free of his comic backdrops and the touches of absurd melodrama that often accompany some of his more exaggerated characters (this isn't a criticism so much as an observation). Here the film moves quickly from Victor's birth into the fateful event that sees him jailed and we find ourselves in a serious story that is well delivered. That the narrative is unpredictable and perhaps a tad unlikely is testimony to the realism in the characters because their emotions and motivations within this mix of guilt, hate and regret are contradictory and complex ? just as they would be in real life. But yet somehow Almodóvar holds it together and makes it engaging and, amazingly, convincing. I want to talk about how he turns this story into a tale I believed in but somehow he does; perhaps because he keeps it so raw and intense throughout, infecting even the sex with the emotions that exist within each character so that even those acts are borne of so much more than desire.Almodóvar also draws impressive performances from his cast which is a great help in pulling off the intensity of the tale. Cruz will be the name everyone knows but she only has a tiny role to play. It is hard to pick one stand out performance from Bardem, Neri and Rabal because the three of them are so convincing and seem to have totally engaged with their parts despite some of the actions being hard to accept on paper. Molina and Sancho are both good but their material is on the edge of the film and they aren't given the same opportunity to explore.Overall this is an impressive film that is raw and intense to the point that it compensates for the stretches within the plot. I can see why some viewers dislike it because it does take some swallowing but it is the impassioned and convincing delivery from director and actors that makes it as engaging as it is.</fullReview>

It gives the impression women in Spain will casually cheat on their husband if they feel like it. Elena did not seem to care how much it would hurt her husband and she tells him of her infidelity in a detached manner. Is this a Spanish thing? A European thing? I also noticed in several French films the French women are portrayed as hopping from bed to bed without much care or regret for the men in their lives as long as they satisfy their base carnal lusts. This is sad if true and portrays them as very shallow women. I think this is also a big problem in America. Since sex is viewed now by many as just another recreational sport.
