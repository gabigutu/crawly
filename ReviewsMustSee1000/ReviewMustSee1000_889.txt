		<shortDescription>I have never before spent so much time analyzing, discussing, or viewing a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it is a FILM. It is no ordinary movie. As a fan of Boogie Nights, I couldn't wait for Magnolia. Although its running time has made at least 20 people leave the auditorium, I have stayed for every single second. The mood and stories and characters keep building and building and building, and when it finally comes down, I feel this immense sense of relief and wonder at how PT Anderson was able to come up with something so clever and intertwining and wonderous, and was able to pull it off. This "movie" is not for everyone. It is thinking-hat required. I have also never been so excited to look up Bible verses before. The cast, as you have probably read, is superb. I have never been so impressed. This film has "restored my faith in the filmmaking industry. To see these actors, crew, and the writer/director/genius at work is inspiring." These people obviously love their craft, and one of my friends even said that the cast was "touched by the hands of God..." to which I whole-heartedly agree. He also has said, ""This film not only teaches film makers how to make films, but it teaches movie watchers how to watch movies!" to which I again whole-heartedly agree a thousand times over. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely outstanding as the only character who is "normal." His performance has made me smile and shake my fist in the air the three times I've seen Magnolia since it opened. Tom Cruise is also spectacular. As with every single last character, every line he utters is important to his character and what it means for the rest of the stories. Another outstanding performance/character is the part of police officer Jim Kurring, played by John C. Reilly. His character is just so perfect and JUST SOOOOO PERFECT that it makes me smile every time he is on screen. Add to all of this one incredible soundtrack, and you have something that will go down in film history as legend and probably one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, and definitely underseen films of all time.The soundtrack, oh, the soundtrack. When listening to the songs, I can picture each exact moment as if I was watching the movie all over again, and it brings unexplainable feeling. Aimee Mann's songs, especially, are a perfect fit to a perfect story and mood. This film is not for everyone, but, if you want to see glorious filmmaking, acting, writing, and characters in action, I HIGHLY suggest you see Magnolia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>often brilliant, occasionally forced film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Magnolia' seems to divide audiences as much as it bewilders them. Some there are who see it as a brilliant exercise in creative, thought-provoking moviemaking, a film that challenges the notion that modern American cinema is comprised exclusively of formulaic retreads of earlier films or slick, mechanical displays of technical virtuosity, devoid of meaning and feeling. Others view `Magnolia' as the nom plus ultra of pretentiousness and self-satisfied smugness. Which of the two assessments is the correct one ? or does the truth lie somewhere in between?Actually, there is much to admire and cherish in `Magnolia.' Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has done a commendable job in putting on the screen a relatively unique vision ? a qualification I feel forced to make because it does seem patently derived from much of the trailblazing work of director Robert Altman. Like Altman, Anderson creates a vast canvas of barely-related and briefly overlapping storylines and characters that come together under the umbrella of a single major theme and a few minor ones as well. Anderson's concern is to explore the concept of forgiveness and to examine the part it plays in the redemption we all seek through the course of our lifetimes. In this film, dying characters struggle to make amends with the loved ones they will soon leave behind, while estranged characters grope tentatively to establish or re-establish the bonds that must link them to other members of the human race. Anderson presents a tremendously wide range of characters, though for a film set in the northern areas of Los Angeles, `Magnolia' provides a surprisingly non-diverse sea of Caucasian faces. However, in terms of the ages of the characters, Anderson's crew seems more comprehensive, running the gamut from a pre-teen wiz kid to a terminally ill man in his mid-60's. Many of these characters seem to have created any number of facades to help them cope with the miseries and disappointments of life ? and much of the redemption occurs only after those masks are stripped away revealing the emptiness and hurt that, in many cases, lurks so close to the surface.Thematically, then, Anderson's film is a compelling one. Dramatically, however, it suffers from some serious flaws. Many viewers and critics have called `Magnolia' an artistic advancement, in both depth and scope, for Anderson, whose previous film was the similarly dense, moderately freeform `Boogie Nights.' I tend to disagree. If anything, `Boogie Nights,' by limiting itself to a much more narrowly restricted milieu ? the 1970's porn industry ? and focusing intently on a single main character, managed to connect more directly with the emotions of the audience. `Magnolia,' by being more expansive, paradoxically, seems more contracted. The pacing is often languid and the screenplay, running a bit over three hours, often seems bloated given the single-mindedness of its basic theme. Certainly, a few of these characters and storylines could have been dispensed with at no great cost to the film as a whole. By lining up all his characters to fit into the same general theme, the author allows his message to become a bit heavy-handed and over-emphatic. Anderson seems to want to capture the whole range of human experience on his enormous (and enormously long) movie canvas, yet because the characters seem to all be tending in the same direction - and despite the fact that the details of their experiences are different - the net effect is thematically claustrophobic.The controversial ending, in which an event of literally biblical proportions occurs, feels generally right in the context of this film, though with some reservations. It seems perfectly in tune with the quality of heightened realism that Anderson establishes and sustains throughout the picture. On the other hand, the ending does pinpoint one of the failures of the film as a whole. Given that the screenplay has a strong Judeo-Christian subtext running all the way through it, one wonders why Anderson felt obliged to approach the religious issues in such strictly oblique terms. None of the characters ? not even those who are dying ? seem to turn to God for their forgiveness and redemption. In fact, one wonders what purpose that quirky ending serves since the characters are well on their way to making amends by the time it happens.Anderson has marshaled an array of first-rate performances from a talented, well-known cast. Tom Cruise provides a wrenching case study of a shallow, charismatic shyster, who has parleyed his misogyny into a lucrative self-help industry. Yet, like many of the characters, he uses this façade as a shield to hide the hurt caused by a father who abandoned him and a mother whose slow, painful death he was forced to witness alone. The other actors, too numerous to mention, turn in equally worthy performances. Particularly interesting is the young boy who, in counterpoint to one of the other characters in the story, manages to save himself at an early age from the crippling effect of identity usurpation that it has taken so many others in this film a lifetime to overcome.In many ways, `Magnolia' is the kind of film that could easily serve as the basis for a lengthy doctoral dissertation for a student majoring in either filmmaking or sociology. The density of its vision would surely yield up many riches of character, symbolism and theme that a first time viewer of the film would undoubtedly miss. Thus, in many ways, `Magnolia' is that rare film that seems to demand repeat exposure even for those audience members who may not `get it' the first time. As a viewing experience, `Magnolia' often seems rambling and purposeless, but it does manage to get under one's skin, and, unlike so many other, less ambitious works, this one grows in retrospect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a film of epic proportions. A film that is our generation's. It's about real life, real people and real coincidences. These things happen, this is happening as Stanley Spector states. Magnolia is as perfect a film as you will see these days. P.T.'s camera acts as the protagonist, and the ensemble cast is one of the most solid in film history. Told in 24 hours, set up by a remarkable prologue and finished with a beautiful epilogue, Magnolia finds beauty in the darkness of life. In the redemption of the filth life sometimes brings us. It shows us that we are all connected through pain and suffering and sinning and yet, it does not give us this pessimistic view. Certain films cannot be described, they must be viewed and everyone should view this masterpiece!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mag*no*li*a - a tree with large, fragrant flowers of white, pink, or purple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serious wake up call to the land of cinema has arrived with the incredible film MAGNOLIA. Human pain and suffering, as well as the ability to avoid making familiar mistakes, are hypnotically explored in P.T. Anderson's intricate motion picture. This is the best movie I've seen in over a year and hopefully will set a new example of realistic cinema depicting real human loss and tragedy. You grow and suffer with each and every character in this huge ensemble movie. MAGNOLIA is indeed a sort of tree with varying branches of people, situations, and irony. To get into any plot aspects would be absurd. This is a 3 hour film that flies by so fast, you want more. You won't like every character, but you will find every character extremely interesting. I've rarely ever seen such deep character portraits in a major motion picture. The title makes much sense after witnessing such vibrant, different colors of the human spirit.P.T. Anderson has arrived, especially after BOOGIE NIGHTS, which he parallels with this effort. His prior film had many of the same human aspects of right and wrong, life and death, but were guised by the porn industry. This guy just explodes with presence and energy, swallowing us with the events on screen. His camera roves everywhere and does not miss a beat. It takes place over a 24 hour period with roughly 12 major players whose lives interlock in multiple degrees of seriousness and sadness. Some begin sad and end hopeful, but these are the few and the lucky ones in this picture.The standouts of the huge cast in particular were Julianne Moore as the shattered wife of TV mogul "Earl Partridge" (Jason Robards), existing now only to watch him die before her eyes of cancer. She is one of the unlucky ones, a character who made so many mistakes that she cannot do over. Philip Baker Hall is great as the host of "What Do Kids Know?" a game show with a truly engrossing side-plot. Hall is also dying and may have done irreparable damage to all around him.John C. Reilly is the centerpiece of this extraordinary film. His cop character is the moral middle at the center of some nasty events. He is also the most likable character because he knows how to treat people, unlike most of the others. He sees how mistakes can't always be made up for. I must also mention Tom Cruise in a career altering performance that took some courage to do. He is completely original, yet not the end all and be all of a film for once.This particular day, as captured and presented by writer-director Anderson, has had a profound effect on me. If you see it, you may know what I mean. Some scars last forever in this life and we all suffer and feel pain equally. MAGNOLIA is like FIVE EASY PIECES on speed. We see numerous people just trying to get along under some extreme circumstances in a labyrinth method, much like the structure of the film's title.RATING: ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even liked the frogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is a film of great passion, wonderful directorial virtuosity and stunning acting. In an age when filmmakers are afraid to make films that are actually about something. P.T. Anderson made a film that is about the most important thing: simply living day to day with all the tragedies and frustrations that can happen in our lives. That he does it with an incredible energy and spirit and passion makes the film even more powerful.I got the feeling all throughout "Magnolia" that directory P.T. Anderson really loves his characters. As the camera moves over each of the characters, allowing us to see their lives, there's a constant feeling that we are seeing the characters souls laid bare on film. When we see Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in a bar ogling the bartender he loves, so much of the character is conveyed in one or two small gestures by actor William H. Macy. In five seconds Macy has conveyed the whole inner life of this character who we then see for three more hours. It's a spectacular moment in a film that is filled with spectacular moments. We seem to see Donnie Smith's soul in that moment. And the film is filled with scenes like that.This film is over three hours long, but every scene fits well in the movie. It's hard to imagine anything being cut, as every scene adds depth and feeling, not to mention the back story for each of the characters. I was entranced all the way through this movie; I never noticed the time at all.This film has haunted me since I first saw it. I kept thinking about quiz kid Stanley Spector just wanting to go to the bathroom, and the haunting soliloquy by Jason Robards on his death bed, and Tom Cruise shifting uncomfortably as he was interviewed. So many amazing characters, so many amazing performances. And yes, I did think about the frogs. Unlike most people, I liked the frogs. It leant a magical realist moment to a realistic film, and symbolically acted as a kid of purification for the painful lives of the characters. Anderson included the frogs for a reason, and they fit his concept of the film brilliantly.This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I'd give it a 10. It's the kind of film that only comes around once every few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point of this film? PLEASE? ANYONE?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood. I won't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.Here is how I would summarize the film: Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence. This followed by (in a nutshell, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following - A children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter, who he may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues, while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s, who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game show's producer, himself dying of lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago, and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru, even as Mr. Producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh, eventually, it rains frogs (You read correctly). And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless, literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than, possibly, to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic'. You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and in turn of not confusing you) if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one... Well, now you know how I feel.</fullReview>

From the fact that every cast member gives an oscar-worthy performance, to the fact that this film has upwards of 10 amazing sequences I have never seen before, and probably will never see again, in any film.This film gets my highest recommendation and a definite 10.

		<fullReview>Never have I seen a more smug film than Magnolia. It's a movie that thinks very high of it's self. It's not an important film or the masterpiece everyone thinks it is. I find it funny seeing the defense of this movie because dissecting a movie shouldn't be rocket science. Like the smugness of Magnolia as it's cast seems to wink at the audience saying "This is deep material we are covering here" the fans of Magnolia seem to say that if you don't appreciate this film you don't have their level of intelligence. Magnolia isn't overly complicated, it's a three hour mess about self-hating individuals complaining about how life has been so cruel to them. We are meant to think it is quirky and intelligent by having over the top performances and an overpowering and unfitting soundtrack in the background.The plot if you can even claim Magnolia has one tells the story of loosely intertwined lives, if you can even call what these people have "lives". All most every character in Magnolia isn't likable. Fair enough, Paul Thomas Anderson was able to make a masterpiece with the villain Daniel Plainview as the main character, but with Magnolia the characters aren't compelling or interesting either, certainly not interesting enough to fill 3 hours screen time.I'll try to explain the story of Magnolia and why each story didn't work. The most popular game show in town is What Do Kids Know? It is hosted by the dying Jimmy Gator who has hosted the show for it's 30 year existence. Jimmy molested his daughter Claudia who has grown up to be a coke addict who is pursued by LAPD patrolman Jim Kurring. What Do Kids Know's record is about to be broken by young Stanley Spector, the previous record holder Donnie Smith has become a drunken has been longing for the love of a bartender with braces whom he thinks will love him if he gets braces. Magnolia is essentially two stories because the link between the story of the dying Earl Partridge is very weak. Earl Partridge is dying of cancer, he has married a gold digger named Linda. Earl spends most of his time with his nurse Phil who tries to fulfill the old man's dying wish by bringing his miserable son Frank TJ Mackey to his deathbed. Frank is the founder of a "self help" system which guarantees the men who subscribe to it that they will be able to turn any woman they want into their sex slave.That's the long and drawn out plot and we think it works because there are loose connections. However the connections mean little to nothing in the long run. They have little significance to the characters and how they change over the experience of the film. In fact I wouldn't say that any of these characters change at all. They just suffer even more with or without each other. The beginning of the film intrigued me, it suggests that rare phenomena occurs through these sort of connections. Nothing phenomenal happens here though other than the biblical plague of frogs raining from the sky with no explanation other than loose references to the bible passage by repetition of the number 82(Exodus 8:2) through out the film.I can't completely condemn Magnolia though, it has potential and interesting concepts but it just isn't executed that well. The performances aren't all bad, like any ensemble picture there are characters and performances you like more than others. I was a fan of John C Reilly's character because he is the least flawed of the group and his relationship with Claudia was interesting, I think P.T.A could have had much more depth there. I think Magnolia's problem is that it's too crowded. I surely would have removed some of the characters and subplots. If you want the central theme to be the connections between these lives than we have to see it and how it has the ability to change these people. Magnolia would have been a better film if it would have come to a much deeper conclusion with these characters because the audience and the characters need to get something from their three hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie from Blockbuster without knowing anything about it. I was hooked from the opening scene until the final frame and was sad to see the movie end. The character development, plot, and acting were magnificent. I was moved on many levels and felt almost every conceivable emotion at one point or another. The characters seemed so real to me that I was hard pressed to think of a movie that had the same strong level of character development across the board. The only negative comment I can make is that I felt like there were a couple loose ends when the movie finished. But this may have been intentional and was a minor blemish in an otherwise very fine film. Even Tom Cruise reached new levels as an actor in this film. I gave it a 9 out of 10, only because a perfect 10 is a once in a lifetime film in my opinion. A must see for serious dramatical movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding ride through one day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dazzling epic of coincidence and fate during one day in the San Fernando Valley. This opens with a short story about some "true-life" examples of coincidence designed to show us that these things can't "just happen" and that there must be more to it than that. It then flies into the lives of a handful of different characters in a exhilarating introduction to a game show host, a sex guru, a police officer, a dying father, a male nurse, a drug addict to name a few. After this the speed slows down slightly and the characters are given time to develop and the stories begin to interlink.Paul Thomas Anderson continues to get better and better with Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and now this. Here he gives a human touch to the director where someone like Altman would have been colder and more clinical. He seems to care about these characters and encourages us to do likewise. The direction is astonishing - it moves at a fast pace when it needs to, it is still and watching when appropriate and, at times, it is downright beautiful in a visionary way. Anderson's tries some audacious tricks and manages to pull them off - a scan round all the main characters singing an Aimee Mann track while they contemplate what's become of their lives is not only daring but works as one of the most moving moments in the film.The acting is flawless - Cruise deserved the Oscar for this performance, but he is only one of an amazing range of actors including Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards, Philip Baker Hall etc. They are all excellent in their roles and make you care for all their characters - no matter how terrible they seem or how bad their crimes.Direction is faultless, performances border on the brilliant, the script is totally convincing and moving. The only weak link is the biblical ending which may annoy some but I think fits in well with the tone of the film, after all, like the film says, "but it did happen".If only all films could meet the standards achieved by this beautiful piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen this year!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first encounter that I ever had with Paul Thomas Anderson was through "Boogie Nights." I admit, I first saw it because of I heard that it was about the porn industry. However, I was surprised to discover an intimate look into the damaged lives of several very interesting, well-developed characters. I also was delighted to have found a new and exciting director whose career and films I will be sure to follow. Anderson's cinematic flamboyance, technical bravura, and inspired storytelling ability make him a talent who is emblematic of the resurrgence in creative and dynamic filmmaking that has occured in this past year. Like Fincher(Fight Club), Mendes(American Beauty), Jonze(Being John Malkovich), and the Wachowski Brothers(The Matrix), Anderson has created a truly unique film that stretches the boundaries of cinema.Many who I saw the movie with grumbled repeatedly about it's length. Clocking in at about three hours and ten minutes, "Magnolia" is long. Even if you are as strong an advocate of the film as I am, you will think that it is long. I really had to go to the bathroom the whole time. But I did not want to miss a single second of Mr. Anderson's fascinating opus. The prologue is very well done, doing a good job of drawing in the viewer. It makes an interesting commentary on coincidence, wjich segues nicely into the rest of the film. The first half hour of the film is the most wonderfully done I have ever seen. Just as Anderson does in "Boogie Nights," the prodigy weaves a fast-paced web of intrigue, flashing tidbits of the many characters' lives that leave the viewer thirsty for more. The rhythm of the film slows down for the bulk of it, as we learn more and more and become more intimately involved in the lives of the wonderfully flawed characters. The film seems to build and build into something bigger than itself. In a way, that is the main flaw of it, but also the beauty of it. Anderson's ambitiousness is huge, but I wouldn't call him an overreacher.This film is so full of great performances. It is probably the best ensemble piece that I have witnessed. There has been much Oscar buzz on Tom Cruise's behalf, but I honestly believe that there are so many Oscar worthy performances in this film that it is a futile effort to mention them all.Particularly strong in the movie is the editing, which allows for the interconnected stories of the various characters to be placed parallel to each other very smoothly. The cinematography is wonderful, obviously influenced by Scorcese. I really don't believe that this film could have been as good as it was if it were any shorter. Seeing it is truly an experience. I was almost sad to see it end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 1999.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, Eyes Wide Shut. Magnolia is definitely the best movie of 1999, and one of the best American movies ever made.Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson's previous effort was already a promising effort, but it was a bit too long. Magnolia is even longer, but it's filled with such a spectrum of touching stories and such a quantity of wonderful characters, that I didn't even notice the three hour length. Magnolia is a mosaic of intertwining and intercepting stories, dealing with such issues as forgiveness, hurt, redemption, sin and the role of chance in our lives. And though the film offers a deep emotional catharsis, it never loses it delicate, humane tone. The people Magnolia displays are not the best of men, but none of them are beyond forgiveness. That, to my opinion, is the most important message the film conveys.As many have already said, Magnolia is an ensemble piece. Acting is superb throughout the film, and though Magnolia has approximately ten lead role and a bunch of supporting characters, there isn't a single member of the cast who is misplaced. My personal favorites are Philip Seymour Hoffman as the sensitive nurse (compare this role to the sleazy characters he played in Boogie Nights, Happiness and The Talented Mr Ripley and you'll notice what a great actor he is), Tom Cruise as the self-made seduction guru (his best performance ever) and William H. Macy as the former child prodigy who never grew up (his role resembles the one he did in Fargo, but in Magnolia he is redeemed of his sins).No film is perfect and even Magnolia has it's flaws, but I'm still so stunned by this masterpiece that I haven't even started to think what they could be. That, I think, says it all about the quality of this film.Rating: **** (of ****)</fullReview>

So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (a still larger portion). As a somewhat well read person, I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode.Don't waste your time. It would be better spent reading......well anything to be honest</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film such as Magnolia does not come around often enough. Though I felt that Boogie Nights attempted the same effect: exposing the base, unrelenting, human desires of Angelinos, it failed in several ways. Magnolia does not. Mr. Anderson sets out to show the underbelly of Americana, much like Mr. Mendes has done spectacularly with American Beauty. At the end of the century, these two films stand as landmarks in the evolution of the American. What we pursue in name only, piety, commonness with our fellow man, family, fame, fortune, and peace of mind, come crashing together in Magnolia, in an apex of misfortune, misunderstanding, forgiveness and renewal. These two films should scare the living daylights out of Americans, especially those living in Los Angeles. The stories show us that merely giving lip service to morals, self-improvement and camaraderie is not enough, we can fake it for only so long, before life overtakes us in a deluge of happenstance and retribution. Mr. Anderson is a wonderful storyteller, and Magnolia is the most visually and aurally satisfying film in years. Ms. Mann's music and the ensemble acting are symphonic. This movie is as tightly composed as any work in cinema one can remember. Obviously, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rich slice of modern life presented wonderfully by Paul Thomas Anderson. Nine or so "broken" people are followed through the film, each of them at least vaguely interconnected to the others. We are shown where they are currently at in life, and find out what has happened to have brought them there. By the end of the film, they are finally at a point where they can confront what is making them so unhappy and perhaps take control of their lives and look forward to a brighter future (even if their time is limited).Some people have complained about the ending of the film, perhaps hoping for everything to be neatly tied up, or at least for something less absurd than we get. In my opinion, however, it is perfectly apt for things to end as they do. We dip into these characters' lives in the present, learn about their past, and leave with optimism for their future. I would have found a cinematic "group hug" to be overly sentimental and highly unnecessary. For that alone, the director must be applauded for exercising some restraint. It would have been far too easy to extend the story a bit further and portray the characters as now being "mended", but this is not how real life is and would not have rung true with the film's overall tone of "this is just something that happens".The sheer ambition of the director is also welcomed. It looks like pre-millennial tension sparked off a mini-renaissance in Hollywood, with this film and others such as "Fight Club" and "American Beauty" harking back to the period in the 70s when there was no distinction between "mainstream" and "arthouse". A-list actors and directors were not afraid to take a few risks and box-office gross was not the only factor used to denote a film's success or failure. It remains to be seen whether the current revival is just a blip. Let's hope not.As for Mr. Cruise, although this may be his best performance to date, at times he looked a bit out of his depth. At the bedside scene, for example, the clenched fist, intense gaze and facial grimace instantly shattered my suspension of disbelief. This trademark Cruise gesture (as much so as Bruce Willis' smirk) crossed the line between character and actor, turning "Frank TJ Mackey" back into "Tom Cruise - Movie Star". For most of the film his performance was convincing, but when the role required some real emotion or loss of control, his limited acting range was exposed. I don't think he'll ever be able to achieve the credibility he'd like, but a good start would be to take on more such challenging roles, with the proviso that they are not obvious vanity projects or oscar-vehicles.To sum up, I found this film warm and sincere, not pretentious as some have suggested. As for the frogs? Well, don't strain yourself looking for some deep, hidden metaphor, just take it at face value and enjoy the pure spectacle that you get from the sheer number and size of the frogs. It's a visually stunning sequence, up there with other truly classic moments in cinema.From reading some of the comments presented here, it seems a shame that many people can't get past the swearing, drugs, running time or "arthouse cinema" tag. To really enjoy this film, you probably need to watch it without any such prejudices, and to leave your cynicism at the door. Don't be afraid of not "getting it", take it as you find it. Just sit back, let it envelop you and you'll be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Calculated Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being startled when I saw "Magnolia" back in 1999. I enjoyed it throughly and I sang PT Anderson's praises. We're in 2007 now - two days into the New Year - and I decided to see "Magnolia" again with a couple of people who were seeing it for the first time. Shocking really. The brilliance is still all there but I couldn't help seeing through it. It all felt so damn calculated that its smart ass phoniness took over my senses. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance made me "feel" something. When I was with him I was somewhere and Tom Cruise is fun to watch. Julianne Moore is unbearable and the whole movie drags from, by now, predictable turn to predictable turn. The frogs are wonderful but they are just frogs pouring over the Valley. I'll see it again in another six years and let's see what happens. I feel that Mr Anderson, if you forgive the impertinence, needs a doses of humbleness. Talent he has, in enormous quantities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue: Repetitive, cliché, full of cursing and is in no way original.The characters: Are either hysterical for no reason, dying, or just plain down trodden fools with no sensibility in their lives and were really not relatable.The script: Completely lacks suspension of disbelief. Seems like it could have been written by an amateur in high school who does not know how to make the story believable. A real disappointment from Paul "Boogie Nights" [10/10] Anderson. 1. There is NO WAY a real game show would have ever played out like that on television. 2. There is NO WAY a 10-year-old could escape a television studio and then bust the library window as deft as a professional burglar.3. There is NO WAY a cop would ever ask out woman who acts like a TOTAL drug addict every minute she is on the screen, no matter how pretty she is, even if he is sensitive to swear words.3. There is no way a wife would use "You should know better!" as her best scolding to her husband that has just confessed that he may or may not have molested their now grown daughter. 4. Donny was a pathetic, juvenile-minded dummy who "Doesn't know where to put his love." He thinks braces with attract his guy crush. This is a grown man! Even then, there isn't the smallest semblance of a relationship with him and Brad the bartender. They don't even speak to each other! He doesn't know how he's going to pay for the braces, yet his appointment is the next day.5. Even the nurse was a total fool in letting the pills spill on the floor and telling the dog "Not to eat it."And at the end no closure is made. Terrible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never, ever have I seen a movie so bad. It started off ok, but then as it when on and I realized I didn't care for the characters, I became exceedingly bored. Not just me but almost everybody in the theatre was the same way, one guy started yelling stuff out, and it was funny and everybody was laughing. On the way out the staff asked us what we thought about it, everybody was saying it was awful. The review I saw on the internet that was the best is "Twice as long as the Blair Witch and just as bad". The never ending movie, with no point, and those of you who have found one, it's so convoluted, that I don't care. I wanted all the characters to die just so it would end. Spoiler -- The raining frogs part was retarded, abso-freaking retarded. This movie represents a downslide in movies on a whole have been going on for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My real introduction to P. T Anderson, the man who would go on to create "There Will Be Blood", this film is not one you watch lightly, but rather one you set aside a whole evening for, lights out, preferably alone or with someone equally as enthusiastic (as is the case with most of his work) and engross yourself in for a good three hours.That three hours is an unusual urban tale in which a host of strangers' stories intertwine, each affecting another in some way. The film is about death, regret and lost opportunities (uplifting stuff!) It is moving beyond measure, a good 90% of the film set to a stunning soundtrack, including powerfully relevant tracks by Aimee Mann, that becomes as vivid and important a character as any of the screen players. This is unconventional cinema that requires some patience, but rewards that patience massively, with great, complex characters, played by a top-notch cast amongst whom there is not a weak link: Tom Cruise is a perfect scumbag with whom we empathise anyway; Julianne Moore is at career-best as a woman who was a gold-digging leach, and who then fell in love with a man whose fate is now out of everyone's hands; William H Macy is an ex boy-genius, now a lost soul just looking to fit in for once, and the young Jeremy Blackman is the current boy-genius, sadly destined to follow in his footsteps. We have Philip Seymour Hoffman, who it would appear can do no wrong, in a relatively small but impacting role as a carer, John C. Reilly as a devoutly religious cop, who is in love with a cocaine-addicted no-hoper, played with intensity by Melora Walters. And there's plenty more...P.T. Anderson's ability to manage tone is remarkable, the film at once funny, heart-warming, sad and heartbreaking, part music video (at one point quite literally), and with a surreal final act, which can put some people off, but whose religious reference is important to those who would understand it. Anderson is a fascinating filmmaker, and love or hate it, you certainly won't walk away from "Magnolia" unchallenged or without reaction. He would go on to up his game with "There Will Be Blood", but this is nevertheless a superb and strange drama that has high impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is an exhilarating experience for any film lover who wants and desires for films that go above and beyond what the vast majority of movies produced today will give to the audience. Got to the theaters and all you will see are mainstream productions completely formulaic, money-driven and without any real emotion or power. It is a fair argument that all film producers care about today is making a profit, getting the audience in and out as quickly as possible and waiting for the next big thing. Paul Thomas Anderson is not such a filmmaker.Magnolia is not such a film. At over three hours long, it toys with the audience, giving them just enough characters to make them feel they cannot follow until they realize they are completely immersed. It also deals with seriously heavy issues and themes; this is not a film for the immature or childish of heart. At times, it can be difficult to watch what is happening because of what isn't being said or done; the most powerful elements of this film are what is implied.That being said, this film succeeds mostly because of the incredible acting from the huge ensemble cast and Anderson's writing, which many feel is too pretentious and self-aware to be taken seriously. However, this is a film that is either bought or sold immediately by the viewer. I bought it and once you do, you are sucked in for the rest of the film. Of course, the acting really brings it home with incredibly powerful performances most notably from Jeremy Blackman, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters and Tom Cruise, who completely upstages everyone else, proving once again that he is a viable actor capable of being considered great for his time and not just a box-office star.Yet, this is an auteur production the whole way through and for that reason, people either love or hate Magnolia. Anderson is one of the most unique and talented filmmakers of the past 20 years and to see any one of his five films is to witness a special vision of the world. Here, we get his views on forgiveness; the power of it and how giving or holding it affects us in life. Of course, the ending is complex, mysterious and perplexing. There are remarkable coincidences and accidents throughout the narrative. Yet, no one can deny the unusual power and potency laying dormant beneath these scenes. All that is needed is for someone to open it up, be exposed to its ideas and be held in spectacle for three hours. The rest is up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but as I write this, voters here have ranked this as the #103 film of all time. It's just not that good. In fact, I didn't even like it. A lot of great actors deliver some great performances, but the movie is so all over the map that it doesn't seem to know what it is trying to say. And, as an unbreakable rule(which bad directors keep breaking), if a movie is going to be more than 3 hours long, it had better be as good as Citizen Kane(which clocked in at just under 2 hours). At least a long movie like 'Heat' is an action thriller.This is a message movie. And a message movie, without a clear message, is a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, incongruous, and simply boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Boogie Nights before Magnolia, so I was obviously excited about this film. Three hours later, I found that my excitement had turned to boredom.This film's major flaw is the characters. None of them are 3-dimensional and we really have no reason to care for any of them. They simply exist to go through random occurrences for the sake of randomness. None of them are given anything exciting to do, and none of them are nearly as developed as they should be. In fact, some of the characters don't even serve a purpose in the film at all! Julianne Moore's character is the prime suspect of that crime. She's addicted to drugs, cries over her dying husband, and tries to kill herself. And somehow, we're supposed to feel sorry for her. Guess what? Doesn't work. We are given no REASON to feel sorry for her. We are never given any reason to feel sorry for ANOBODY in this movie. They are simply there. They do things and that is it. Seriously, why the hell am I supposed to give a damn if some know-it-all brat pisses his pants?The beginning of this film showed promise. In an over-long opening sequence, three urban legends are examined for their mysterious coincidences. But sadly, there is nothing even remotely as bizarre or exciting in the actual movie. People meet other people and that's the extent of it. Speaking of people, let's take a look at some of the characters:There's some kid who pisses his pants, a dying old man and his overly emotional male nurse, the old man's wife who does nothing, a cop (the most interesting character, mostly because of John C. Reilly), a drug addict (not the old man's wife, a different drug addict), the guy played poorly by Tom Cruise (unsure of his official title), a gay man who wants to get braces to impress a bartender (what?!), and many more.Instead of actually having any reason to care about these character's unhappy lives, we are TOLD to care. Doesn't work. Cinematically speaking, this film is actually well-directed, edited, the cinematography is great, but the music is over-used. The film could also be shortened by about a half hour by simply not following around unimportant character from place to place before they vanish and are never to be seen or heard from again. What a total waste.If you actually believe that this film is original at all, just watch Short Cuts and you'll see the truth. Magnolia is a rip-off. A bad one where everyone has to cry every 5 minutes and sing together at the end before something totally outrageous happens for no reason at all and with no explanation.And speaking of Exodus 8:2, you will notice a lot of 8's and 2's in the film. Thing is, it's too overt. It's pretentious because Anderson is showing people how clever he is instead of actually being clever and letting people see it on their own. I'll even give an example of this whole "cleevrness with numbers" deal with THE SHINING:Danny wears a jersey with number 42 Danny and his mom watch the movie Summer of 42 Half of 42 is 21 There are 21 pictures on the Gold Room wall The July 4th Ball was in 1921 The mirror image of 21 is 12 (mirrors play a key role in The Shining) The two times shown via screen titles are 8 PM and 4 PM (8+4=12) The radio call sign for the Overlook Hotel is KDK 12 Anderson has a lot to learn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film which impresses with great performances, a great storyline and maybe the best beginning ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 17 years old. My expectations were high and I have to admit, that it belied them. At this view, approximately 3 years ago, the performances shined out for me and I've not really engaged myself in the rest of this mediocre film.My second viewing was nearly 2 years back. Regarding the plot, I was very confused because the beginning stayed in my head the whole 188 minutes and at the end, I couldn't see a satisfying connection between it and the rest, especially between the beginning and the ending. I was expecting some 'Crash'-like connections between the characters.So I gave 'Magnolia' a third shot and I was blown away by it. Therefore, I give it 9 out of 10 and it's in my Top 10 movies of all time. First of all, I have to write about the incredible performances by the whole cast. Everyone is so much into his character and it seems that each actor was very free concerning his play. For example: Julianne Moore plays the spouse Linda Partridge, whose husband Earl (Jason Robards) will die of lung cancer. She never loved her husband but now, he is in extremis and she discovers an unprecedented love towards him. Linda doesn't take care of Earl because she wants to smooth things over by reason of cheating on him several times. She takes care of him only because she really loves him. She even wants to change Earls last will although all of his money would be hers, just because she feels dirty concerning her past. The pharmacy-scene is very important to see how she feels. Linda doesn't want to be called lady, because in her own eyes she isn't a lady anymore after all the things she has done to her husband: "You ... call me lady? Shame on you!" We only see Jason Robards lying in the bed but he manhandles the role perfectly not least because of the dialog. Julianne Moore proves that she can handle dramatic roles. Philip Seymour Hoffman (Phil Pharma, the nurse of Earl Partridge) shows that he can pull out a lot of supporting roles. Then, there is Tom Cruise who was nominated for Oscar for his role as Frank T.J. Mackey, Earl Partridges son. Mackey and Partridge are out of touch and Earls last will is, that Phil Pharma brings Mackey to Earls deathbed. Mackey is leader of his own seminar, in which he learns men how to seduce women with his program "Seduce and Destroy. Philip Baker Hall, plays the show presenter Jimmy Gator who has an icky relationship to his drug-addicted daughter Claudia Wilson Gator (wonderfully played by Melora Walters).Last but not least, there's John C. Reilly. In my opinion, Reilly is the best of the cast. He plays the officer Jim Kurring who takes his job very seriously. He becomes acquainted with Claudia Wilson Gator and a relationship is about to start between these completely different humans. William H. Macy is Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, a Man who won in Jimmy Gators Show many years ago. His character is very curious, Smith robs money from his work to can afford a brace with which he, as he thinks, would be loved by a barkeeper who also has one. Jeremy Blackman, the youngest cast member plays Stanley Spector, a very intelligent child who is going to be the new Quiz Champion. He suffers under the severity of his father . You see, there are thematic overlaps between the characters, for instance education.The beginning is amazing, maybe the best I've ever seen. Three accounts are told and all are just too improbably to believe them. And at the end of the last account, the narrator says: "This was not just a matter of chance. This strange things happen all the time".At the end of the movie there are frogs falling from the sky. A frog-rain. There's a reference to the Bible's book Exodus 8:2, which says: "And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs". The numbers 8 and 2 are also present in different parts of the movie. So, after my first two viewing I have never seen a conclusion. After the third view, 1 week ago, I spent a lot of time discussing and analyzing this movie. I don't think, that God made the frog fall from the sky just because there's a line in the Bible which comes up with the same phenomenon. But i definitely think that there's a higher force. I have to say: The frograin is really important for all of the characters. For instance Jimmy Gator wants to take his life because he will die of cancer and because of his vague past with his daughter (he doesn't know if he abused her or not). He puts the gun to his head and in the same moment a frog is falling into the kitchen, onto the gun and the shot goes into the television which starts to fume. Kurring is driving home and helps Smith to give the money back he's stolen before. Earl Partridge awakes because of the frograin and realizes that his son came for visiting him. And Stanley Spector is sitting in front of some textbooks, sees the frograin, smiles and says: "This is something that happens". And here, the circle is complete! There are things in life we can't believe. Things that are very unlikely. Not only natural phenomena also phenomena between human beings. At the beginning we hear: "This was not just a matter of chance". So that says that there is sort of an 'act of nature'. "This is something that happens", and it's not a matter of chance.This was my first review, hope you liked it. I finally entrust 'Magnolia' to you and I hope you can enjoy it as I did. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

This film combines a large number of short narratives and characters that intertwine together in an attempt to portray some vague message of lifes ambiguity and randomness. wow, Great message Paul. If you wanted me to identify with these characters why did you make ALL of them mentally retarded... the fact that Tom Cruise was the stand out performance in this film says enough, and he basically played himself.There's no point even discussing this film, on a basic level, it feels like the end product of a year 8 media studies final. overdone, and seriously pretentious :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent ensemble piece with fine acting all around...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain element of risk that comes with making a 3-hour long ensemble piece. If the film fails, viewers are not only disgruntled because they saw a poor movie, but also because it consumed 180 minutes of their time; time that could have been spent more wisely. Paul Thomas Anderson, fresh off his highly successful BOOGIE NIGHTS, shows that he indeed has the skill to successfully embark upon such a risky venture.Three hours can be quite a long time to spend watching a movie and Anderson manages to keep the viewer interested by not staying in any one scene for more than 5 minutes; that way the story feels like it's actually progressing and not stagnating. Admittedly, the film still starts to lag around the 130-minute mark but Anderson uses a rather unexpected scene to snap viewers back into full and undivided attention.The acting is first-rate with stellar performances by Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, and William H. Macy. Cruise in particular produces his finest work since BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and warrants the Oscar nomination. All 10 or so of the actors involved in the actual ensemble do wonderfully well. Indeed, the key element of an ensemble piece is undoubtedly the overall acting. It should also be noted here that while all 10 actors do not actually interact with each other, they do share a common theme of suffering that is pervasive throughout the film and goes a long way to explaining key elements of the movie.The next key element is the Screenplay, which in this case is simply amazing. The dialogue is excellent, and is one of the more under-rated aspects of this picture. This film ages well and seems to get better each time one sees it. It grows on you, as they say.The Soundtrack is also top-notch and most of the opening 100 minutes or so features some sort of soft background music (with vocals) while the remainder of the film is more score-oriented, save for one critical and debatable scene. The music goes a long way to setting the overall ambiance of the movie.This film is not for everyone, though. If you need fancy flashy nonsensical special effects to keep you interested, your best bet may be to stay away. It is more of a cinematic experience than a movie; one that will spark numerous intellectual debates as each viewer will have different perspectives on the key events of the film. This is not one of those movies you can just watch once. As mentioned, this film ages exceptionally well, and is one for true appreciators of fine film-making.Strongly recommended. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 100 at #91 or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Bloom: P.T. Anderson's "Magnolia"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies transcend our world. Some movie shirk any logical concept of "reality" or "fantasy". Some movies spring to such giddy, operatic heights that they completely bypass the intellectual, and exist as wholly emotional experiences. In doing so, they reveal more about the human experience than any gritty, realistic film could.P.T. Anderson's 1999 epic "Magnolia" is that kind of a movie. Set in a heightened Los Angeles, it tells the interconnected tales of a large cast of characters, each of whom are undergoing a crisis. Anderson (who also scripted the film) is savvy enough to cast the film with recognizable faces, ensuring that the audience has a firm grasp on who these people are and how they connect to one another. The cast is filled out by actors of the highest caliber (Phillip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Julianne Moore to name only a few) who embody the lives of their characters outside the film. "Magnolia" relies on cross-cutting throughout the picture, establishing both a frenetic pace, along with a sense of destiny. The camera whizzes around gleefully, while these tragedies unfold before us. It is compelling stuff, even at three hours plus. So compelling that the material could serve to be lengthened. If there is a problem in "Magnolia", it is that there are a few tantalizingly loose ends that I'd like to explore further.I am consciously trying to avoid plot summary here, because in all honesty, this film defies any sort of condensation. But there is still the question: What is it about? I've seen it three times now, and the closest I can arrive to a theme or message is this: It is about the fundamental sadness and struggle that unites us as human beings. Like flower petals, we all share the same roots. We all endure loss. We all must go it alone. Yet in our loneliness, we are united.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Thomas Anderson's best film to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson has only directed five films. Which I think is a shame. Cause a terrific director like him should be doing tons. Maybe, since he's done five masterpieces already, he's afraid that if he does more, than he'll go on a losing streak. I don't believe that will happen. It happened with Steven Spielberg once(I hated Artificial intelligence). But with Anderson, I doubt it's going to happen. Anderson's five films have been Hard eight, Boogie nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk love, and There will be blood. I'll admit that I never saw Hard eight. But I saw the other four. and loved them all. Only a couple of them may sound familiar to some. Those few are probably Boogie nights, Punch drunk love, and There will be blood. I loved all of those, but none of them are my favorite. My favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film is called Magnolia. There are moments in Magnolia that will make you laugh, they will make you go "Yeah, stick it to the man", and it will make you go"Well, that's not very nice. But there is one moment that will make you go "What the hell". That moment is a scene where it starts to rain frogs. That's another thing that I love about his movies. In some of them he throws in the most random of stuff and never explains any of it. Why did it rain frogs? We don't know. He does though. And he just wants us to go "What the hell".Magnolia is the original Crash. Except that one won best picture of the year. American Beauty won best picture in 1999. Magnolia wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Which I think is a crime. My top two favorite films of 1999 weren't even nominated. Magnolia was one of them. This is such a real movie. The performances are just spectacular. Especially from Tom Cruise. Now that surprised me. He was nominated. But lost. Which is another crime.Well, if you know the plot, then you know the plot to Magnolia. But I shall explain it. Magnolia is the story of a group of people living in San Fernando Valley. They are all connected in some way. John C. Reilly plays a cop that falls for a cocaine addict. The cocaine addict has problems with her father(played by Phillip Baker Hall), who hosts a game show. On this game show, is a boy named Stanley(played by Jeremy Blackman)who is being forced to play cause of his father. William H. Macy is also great as a nerdy guy who was once on the game show himself.Juilianne Moore plays a woman who married an older man for his money. But now he has cancer and she's in love with him and doesn't want to be in the will. The problem is that they don't know who will be in the will. Because the only other person that could be in it is the elderly man's son(played by Tom Cruise), who he hasn't seen since he was ten years old. Magnolia is occasionally funny, like most of his films. I loved everything about this movie. I loved it's occasional strangeness. I loved the lessons that it teaches. I also loved how it shows coincidences. Such as the opening scene. These actors are great. William H. Macy has played a dorky character in a couple of films. And he really succeeds here. Like always. Everyone does. Magnolia is just a masterpiece. Oh, I forgot to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is very good here too. Anyways, Magnolia is Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece, and a masterpiece all together.Magnolia: A++++++++++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinarily moving and serious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is an extraordinarily moving and serious film. Its central concern is the question of what happens when people who have done bad things go unpunished in life. The two people in question ? Earl Partridge and Jim Gator ? are both being claimed by cancer 'early' but also after very prosperous and well-respected lives. They have both damaged their children ? one by direct abuse, which the film represents with unparalleled honesty and success ? and the other by leaving him to nurse his dying mother. Claudia Gator and Frank Mackie express this damage in their everyday lives and remain solidly opposed to reconciliation with their dying fathers. These relationships are reflected in a third abusive father-child relationship, which is still at its outset ? that between Stanley the child prodigy and his father, who violently exploits his son for gain on a child quiz show. Stanley's possible future is mirrored in the life of ex-quiz quid Donnie Smith, who has been broken by his early 'success' and is a figure of fun and hopelessness. The culmination of the film is Stanley going to his father's bedside and delivering the words 'Dad, you need to be nicer to me'. We are therefore left with the hope that either following a reform of his father's behaviour or ? more likely ? through Stanley's new found strength of character, Stanley will be saved from the permanent damage we see in Donnie, Frank and Claudia. The foil for this action is Jim Kurring, a policeman who seeks to do good. Against the backdrop of the other characters, his optimism and moral compass seem strongly tempered by naivety. He is also religious, which ? while it is not condemned ? is clearly not a solution for the other characters in the film. But his agency is still the main motor for good in the film. In the closing scene we see him providing the beginning of a rehabilitation to Claudia, which is a strongly positive closing note even if there is still along way to go for her. He also lets Donnie off a criminal charge, and we hope that Donnie will respond to this kindness by recognising the problems confronting him and beginning to take hold of his life. In these respects he is the main agency for good in the film. He does not, however, interact with the other 'victims' Frank and Stanley. Stanley begins to act as his own saviour. Frank is the least likely to undergo a serious reform or rehabilitation but we do at least see him weeping, which is an advancement on his previous behaviour. This is not the "nom (sic) plus ultra of pretentiousness and self-satisfied smugness" or "a relatively unique vision". This is real art, which examines human relationships with profound intelligence and honesty. There is not "much to admire and to cherish" here: there is much to learn. It is natural for humans, as animals, to put themselves first in certain situations. But selfishness can cross a line when those on the receiving end are left with little hope of ever becoming functional people, let alone happy. The film challenges viewers to reach into their lives and ask which of their own relationships contain these elements. If a viewer empathizes with the parents, they are forced to confront the lifelong consequences of selfish parenting on a younger generation, as well as the non-forgiveness these parents are confronted by before death. But if a viewer empathizes with the children, he or she is also immediately forced to confront the basic humanity of the parent-perpetrators, as well as their obvious fallibility. This is most touchingly evident in Earl Partridge's second wife falling in love with him for the first time on his deathbed. Depending on their age, they may empathize with both parents and children ? hence the final song, sung in part by all of the characters, with the chorus line "It's not going to stop till you wise up". The last line adds "? so just give up", not as a serious incitement but as a challenge to continue. It is a challenge that intelligent viewers will take up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thank thee, Mr. Anderson, for this brilliant masterpiece of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most powerful films are the ones that make you think and be entertained. They are the ones that once you finish them, you will immediately want to see them all over again. They are the ones that make you sit there even an hour after the end credits have rolled and you continue to wonder about the meanings behind such an impressive work of art. No other film comes close to defining those sentences as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's riveting multi-character drama Magnolia. While watching Magnolia (and even after), I was enthralled, entranced and began to view life is a different way. Watching Magnolia is an experience I will never forget, as every time I watch it, my self-esteem gets even higher and the world around me feels completely different. A walk in the park does not feel the same way after watching Magnolia. And I am certainly not able to watch rain pouring down from the sky without thinking that something bigger will happen. This is the effect that Magnolia has had on me.Magnolia interwines many characters and situations into one day and there is not a single chink in how Anderson writes and directs these chains. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is a television producer, dying from cancer and whose only support along with his machine are his nurse Phil (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and much younger wife Linda (Julianne Moore). His final dying wish is to see the son who he left many years before with his ex-wife. His son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) is now a motivator for men and keeps his past safely hidden from public view. Meanwhile, the game show host of 'What Do Kids Knows?', Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is growing fainter and fainter and his drug-addicted daughter Claudia (Melora Waters) becomes the object of affection of kind policeman Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly). The current game show champ, Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) has problems with his money obsessed father and after an accident occurs on air, he has had enough. The former game show champ Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), now with none of his winnings attempts to get a local bartender to fall in love with him, even if it means falling towards crime. This description of Magnolia's events are not even enough to give the film justice as it has to be seen to get the whole story. Merely reading a plot summary won't do anything.If Paul Thomas Anderson's only film was Magnolia, that would still make him the best filmmaker of my generation. While other serious filmmakers try to make films either to homage previous works (Quentin Tarantino), add some more awards to their shelves (Clint Eastwood) or receive a lot of money (Peter Jackson), Anderson instead makes films that have some more spice and meaning than what can be found today at the local 20-screen, stadium seat multiplex. When he makes a scene in which all of the characters sing to Aimee Mann's "Wise Up", it's not just because it's "cool", but because he's talking about how even though people will feel something different than somebody else, there's still something makes them the same and connectible. In fact, the use of Aimee Mann's songs, particularly her magnum opus "One" which opens the picture and through which we are introduced to each and every character, is pure genius on Anderson's part as he allows even the music to express the character's feeling. The actors work along with the score to provide an very soothing experience. Despite the film's three hour length, not once do you feel like your bottom is aching like it would while watching a bloated epic. You're amazed by the imagery presented on screen and the way the story cuts back and forth between everyone.The actors play a major part in Magnolia as well. Tom Cruise gives quite possibly the work that he will not surpass for many years, as unlike his other performances, we actually truly care about the character, despite him being written as a sexist snob. The relationship between Claudia and Kurring are portrayed perfectly and very realistically by Melora Waters and John C Reilly, who provide real awkwardness to the conversations that Anderson has provided them to speak. The crowning performance of the film is, without a doubt, Philip Seymour Hoffman's subtle and heartbreaking work as Phil the nurse. We see the character's feelings through his eyes and mannerisms. He is the only sane person in this world full of bizarre individuals and his struggle could not have been shown better by another actor. Yet, past the music, the cinematography, the editing and the performances, the man who is the most responsible for Magnolia's brilliance and its immediate entry into the hall of American motion picture classics is Paul Thomas Anderson. Magnolia is his almighty gift of forgiveness to the world and boy, it is quite a fantastic effort to be sure. Magnolia is like a massage and even while writing this review, I still feel it juicing my brain and allowing to think and know that film is the most important and most powerful medium ever created. I thank thee, Mr. Anderson, for this brilliant masterpiece of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I really admire PT. He has a visual imagination. Its rather immature and not integrated into the narrative like Altman can. He has a way of placing and shaping actor's relationship to the viewer. Again, it is rather childish compared to Kurosawa or Welles. But the fact that he knows about this makes him rare and worthy of respect. Because of this, he knows (or intuits) what's in each actor: some play directly, some play themselves playing, some play irony. Those are the ordinary stances. Cruise and most other are limited to that range, but Moore is not. Hoffman is not. These two can create multiple stances that form a baroque richness to the entire project.I believe that PT started with this notion of filling all the narrative levels of abstraction, something he thinks is in Mann's music. Then he set about constructing a means to create and populate every level that he and partners could find. This is not like Altman who uses the short cuts to play off of and contrast; PT uses something similar to build and is able to achieve effective simultaneous perception of all these levels at once.The story is not the focus at all, but he has crafted several threads, all based on narrative as discovery. All discoveries in this world produce profound consequences, different punishments for insight. Therefore, all narrative quests in this world have angst. This isn't fun like the Coens give us, this is work.This man, PT, could turn out to be important. He could create some lifealtering stuff some day. Meanwhile, his notebooks are worth watching.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who enjoyed Mangolia have a habit of rubbishing the opinion of those who didn't, and dismissing them as ignorant, brain-dead and bereft of emotional appreciation.I expected to enjoy Magnolia, as the trailer made it look like an interesting film. How wrong I was! For Magnolia is a ludicrously overlong, completely self-indulgent, mawkish mess of a film. Yes, there are separate stories and characters in it that intertwine, but this process is so tedious and the characters themselves so bland and uninteresting that you're just not interested when the 'Short Cuts' moments come about.Mangolia is full of people crying over their many malfunctions. There is a game show host with cancer, a lonely cop, a sexually abused girl, a genius kid whose Dad won't show love for him, a glamorous misogynist with a secret past, a man smitten with love for a bartender, and many others. The manner in which their suffering is documented is unsubtle and often laughable. Several of Julianne Moore's scenes, in particular, are so unbelievably melodramatic that you wonder whether the critics were watching the same movie as you. At one point, the characters, all in different locations and situations, begin to sing along to a song from Aimee Mann's soundtrack. Intended to be a classic moment, this is so hilariously stupid you have to laugh out loud at it.But you can't get too many laughs from Magnolia, as it takes itself so terribly seriously. The dying man's pointless ten-minute monologue emphasises just how lamentably bloated the whole thing is. Yes, there are messages, presented so blatantly they'd make Ollie Stone cringe: 'loneliness is bad' or, as the song goes, 'one is the loneliest number', 'love your kids', 'everybody hurts', etc, etc, etc. Magnolia is no classic. Rather, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Anderson's direction is colourful and occasionally innovative, but overall, the film is woeful. None of the actors do themselves any favours either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A taut, tense and mesmirising film that unfortunately loses power due to its length, however it is otherwise good. The film is an interesting, well acted and for the most of it well shot cinema piece, concerning how one person can affect others unintentionally. It is, however, too complex and often hard to understand, which tends to lose a viewer's attention. In addition, the film is not dissimilar from other films about interconnecting lives that the film industry has presented before us. This one however tries to add some extra meaning to the genre, only in part succeeding, because although the philosophy at the start of the film seems appropriate, the end sequence metaphor seems somewhat ill judged. Tom Cruise's superb performance earned him an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

I had to return it 4 hours later at Blockbuster and I thought...what the hell, I want to see why there was so much fuss about this movie. After about an hour into the film, I noticed that there was no absolute plot leading the story into any foreseeable direction. No plot, no point, I loved it. I've never seen a film with so much force and the pacing was absolutely astounding. The story was filled with little vignettes and constantly jumped from one scenario to another scenario with such a smooth transition that I was in movie heaven. I loved the 3 hours spent on this great movie. Definitely an art piece that people should not miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another special film from Paul Thomas Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even braver and deeper emotionally than Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights', and in some ways a more mature, if less blazingly dynamic work. Full of amazing shots, amazing performances. The film 'Short Cuts' wanted to be. That said there are a few flaws. The biblical ending doesn't quite work for me. I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that's less emotional for me than the film that proceeded it. And a few moments of irony are forced. That was true in 'Boogie Nights' too, but because that film had a lighter, more self-mocking touch, even the heavy handed moments didn't stick out. None-the-less, this is a must see film, overflowing with great performances, unconventional storytelling, heartbreaking moments, and an honest look at where we are and who we are as a society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cracking Up in the World of PTA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson followed up the dazzlingly audacious "Boogie Nights" (1997) with the even more (if possible) audacious saga of emotional meltdowns over one dark night in L.A. in "Magnolia," and left people scratching their heads.There's an awful lot going on in this movie all the time, and I can see how it would be a turn off for some. I was utterly engrossed by it, so much so that I went back to see it again and sat mesmerized by it a second time. Anderson has one big hairy set of bull balls to make a 3+ hour epic full of dark soliloquies, death, disease and an impromptu musical number performed by the entire cast, sustain an emotional tone as tightly strained as a piano wire for almost the entire film's length, and then cap the whole thing off with a rain of frogs."Magnolia" isn't the most disciplined film ever made, and Anderson's film-making hysteria sometimes runs away with his stories, but it sure is one endlessly fascinating piece of work. Anderson has matured greatly over the years -- "There Will Be Blood" was far more restrained and controlled than any of his previous movies. But in every movie he makes, you can see the mad genius behind the scenes, and I can't wait to see what he's going to do next.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching film with some incredible performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the comments archive, I can see why this film polarizes its audiences as much as it does. This film defies convention in all possible senses--characterization, dialogue, narrative structure, heck, even the introduction. To be honest, this movie is truly strange. But that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Quite the contrary, actually. In my opinion this is one of the best movies I've seen. The acting was superb, and the performance I got from Tom Cruise was surprising to say the least. I don't expect much from him other than crocodile tears and beaming that thick smile, but here he credibly displayed a wide range of emotions. The photography was excellent, the pacing was quick (despite the 3:15 runtime!), and the structure! the best thing about it. Although the movie does dwell on a very central theme--the price and necessity of salvation--much of the movie is left undone, as raw material for thinking about later, as if the characters just keep on living. As I said, it's not your standard movie fare. But don't dismiss it for what lies most visably on the surface; instead, sit through the movie, soak it in, and when it's done, turn out the lights and think about it for a while. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson's Emotional Tour-De-Force Blooms Brilliantly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PT Anderson's sprawling character epic is nothing short of brilliant, eviscerating the lives of a vast array of tortured souls in the San Fernando Valley.Magnolia presents to us the seemingly totally different, separate lives of twelve people having quite a trying and tumultuous day. There's a dying TV mogul (Jason Robards), his estranged son turned sex empowerment spokesman (Tom Cruise), Robard's devastated, guilt-ridden wife (Julianne Moore), Robard's nurse/caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a dying TV quiz show host (Phillip Baker Hall), his estranged, drug-addled daughter (Melora Waters), the game show host's worrisome wife (Melinda Dillon), a brilliant quiz kid on Hall's show (Jeremy Blackman), and his overbearing father (Michael Bowen), an ex-quiz kid now living in shambles (William H Macy), a well-meaning, prudish officer (John C Reilly), and a rapping street kid (Emmanuel Johnson). Their lives intersect either directly or briefly as they give confessions, show forgiveness, come to terms, and ultimately are given redemption.As convoluted and confusing the amount and relationships and the characters may sound, Anderson skillfully balances them all and fleshes them out, making them three dimensional characters that the viewer cares about. With so many characters, one would imagine some of them are filler, throw away roles - but in reality, all of them impact the viewer and prove to be an integral part to the entire film. Performances in Magnolia run the gamut from poignant to heartfelt to astounding to subtle to powerful to nothing short of brilliant. Though all performances are great, there are a few that stand out: William H. Macy, as always, gives a beautiful performance as the ex-quiz kid who goes to absurd lengths to find love. Jeremy Blackman's overachieving, unloved quiz kid is also heart-wrenchingly well portrayed. Phillip Baker Hall's seemingly wholesome game show host who himself cannot answer any questions is expertly and poignantly drawn. The real treat, however, is Tom Cruise (yes, his role is as well done as it's been touted) as the cool, hyped up sex guru who is slowly deconstructed by his past. There is so much to enjoy about Magnolia, besides it's well-written, provocative characters: the film's cinematography is so beautifully rendered that the camera seems to be working on it's own, weaving seamlessly through hallways and long shots without any cuts. It seems to reach into the characters and pull out all their vulnerabilities for the audience to see. Aimee Mann's haunting songs also add a potent touch of misery and darkness to the already unsettling script.From it's overwhelming opening set-up accompanied by the miserable tune "One" to it's Biblical ending, it's an emotional epic that plunges the viewer into the depths of its character's personal hells and shows that closure and redemption can be a painful but ultimately necessary part of life.Easily one of 1999's best, most ambitious films, and ranking in my top 10 of all time, Magnolia is an emotional tour-de-force that touts a great ensemble cast, a beautifully written script, stylish camera work, and a great soundtrack. The ending is a shocking, memorable one as well, and proves that PT Anderson is a brilliant, formidable filmmaking force be dealt with. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotional movie ive ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first five minuts of this movie i knew i was in for something strange, something unique, something different. What i got was a powerful movie that forced me to think and just be drawn into a world unlike any other ive seen. The human element was so real it was scary. When the dying man confessed his life to his nurse i almost had to turn it off and pull myself back together. It wasnt that long ago i lost my mother to cancer and the reality of this man lying is his death bed was so powerful, so brilliantly horrific, i was in tears. The story of his, at first money hungry, druged up, guilt ridden, wife was painfully beautiful. When she goes to get some prescripitions only to have the clerks stare and probe into as why someone would need such things evoked a sence of privacy being violated for someone who deserves no sympathy yet screams at you for help. Tom Cruise's character as the idealistic ID of a man's personality to the infinite power was brave and unabashed. Him lying by his fathers side, a man who deserted him and his dying mother, a man who he had not seen in years, a man who's dying wish was to see his son, was played with such raw emotion its a wonder why these two people were not givin some kind of reward for there acting. We get the story of a whiz kid quiz show star and a story of a former whiz kid quiz show star where the former is so fed up with having to do everything and being the smart one and dealing with his overcrazed father while the latter cant shake the shadows of his former "fame" and just cant do anything with his life. This man was disturbing, all he wanted to do was love. He just wanted to love someone, anyone, anything, because he didnt love himself enough to move on from his past.....ahhh the past...a subject so defined in this film. Some poeple are able to move through life and things either fall into place all nice and cozy or there little speed bumps dont affect them. Yet there are many out there who cant get through the past. cant understand why they may have done certain things and are left with the guilt of there "sins" and it runs them into the ground day after day after day. No one said life was easy and certainly there is no handbook. we all should know right and wrong but once you cross that line is there anyway to come back? that is what this movie is asking. and like life there is no answer. we just dont know.Now the sing a long that has got everyone's attention was perfect in my eyes. at the time of the story to see something you really never seen before with so much meaning was amazing. Mann's song rang through my ears like few others have before. And the frogs...well...im not a religous person...i understand this came from the bible...its exact meaning i do not know. but as the movie tells you all along regret is blatantly hard.i give this movie, film, story, personal page out of life, what ever you want to call it, a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rent "Magnolia".That's an order.Finally got off my butt and went to a video store today to grab it, and spent the afternoon watching it. Blew me away. Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. You have to pay attention to the music -- like an episode of Ally McBeal, the soundtrack is an essential part of the story and not just a track to sell MTV buzz bands. This is never so clear as when Aimee Mann's "Wise Up" kicks in about two thirds of the way through -- what's about to happen is very unusual for a mainstream film, but it's the tearjerking emotional heart of the movie.The movie begins with a news reel of urban legends we've all heard before -- the scuba diver in the middle of a forest fire, the man who was accidentally killed by his mother while in the process of a suicide attempt that would otherwise have failed because he landed in a safety net. Then, in an anthology style, we watch the lives of several seemingly unconnected people unfold. A man on his deathbed, his distraught wife, an arrogant anti-feminist sex guru, a strung-out cocaine addict, a bland but happy Christian police officer, a game show host who's just learned he's dying of cancer, a hyperintelligent young boy and a middle-aged man who's mysteriously desperate to pay for braces despite appearing to have perfectly straight teeth. Well, you've seen enough Atom Egoyan movies to know that these stories are all connected in very profound ways. (Pay attention to the closing credits on the game show, by the way, or you'll miss one of the connections.)You have to suspend a bit of disbelief at the climax, but it makes perfect sense in the larger context.A profound and deeply affecting meditation on life, love, loneliness and the things we do to blot out our pain, Magnolia asks you to walk in another person's shoes before you cast judgement on them. It also offers redemption in some of the strangest places, and dares to ask "What can you forgive?"And hard as it may be to believe, Tom Cruise will actually make you cry.</fullReview>

The casting is perfection as it always is from Cassandra Kulukundis.The script is virtually flawless(except for spelling and grammar), and could possibly be better than the movie.The film is shot in anamorphic which fits the atmosphere of the film eloquently.P.T.A. is one of the most interesting writers with many interesting and disturbing stories to tell. His skills as a director are also visible in the screenplay and the film. The direct conduction of the camera movement from the paper to the screen is amazing. Many scenes could have been boring if not for the acting and the constant pushing and pulling of the camera from close ups to two-shots.Magnolia is sad, brutal, and at times hilarious and violent. The complete 189 min. of this film are truthfully worth your time.</fullReview>

It's a such fantastic film, that your glued to the screen from start to end. It's over 3 Hours in running time, yet this winner never bores. The characters, their ark in the goings-on left me awe-struck. 'Magnolia' makes you laugh when your suppose to, and cry when your suppose to. Paul Thomas Anderson's writing and direction, translate, into, his career's finest effort.In this multi-starrer each actors scores, and here's a special mention to all of them: Tom Cruise is astounding and undoubtedly the guy who steals the show! The Iconic Actor of Cinema delivers a performance that leaves you stunned! John C. Reilly is excellent. Julianne Moore is splendid. Philip Seymour Hoffman is terrific. William H. Macy is superb. Melora Walters is fantastic. Philip Baker Hall delivers his careers finest performance. April Grace is decent. Late Jason Robards is effective.'Magnolia' is a Masterpiece in each and every aspect.

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a work of shear beauty. With a knockout cast, a compelling, heartbreaking plot, and enough creative touches to keep it from being mundane. Each story reflects a younger person, affected by the choices of their parents. Whether it's the boy genius hurt by the way his father, and other adults treat him, as a toy, not a person. The sleazy motivational speaker who was forced to take care of his mother and himself, after his dad left with no notice. The junkie who believes she was molested as a child. The misguided former child star, who shows the effects of the treatment of adults, as a boy genius. But maybe even more compelling are the stories of the adults who effected the lives of these younger people. The game show host, suffering from cancer and the disaffection of his daughter. The mentally unstable woman who married an older man for money, but fell in love with him on his deathbed. The man in the bed who is overwhelmed by the guilt of his past and the self loathing for leaving his wife and son. And there are characters who only enter the stories of other people, without a real background story of their own. The socially awkward cop, who finds it difficult to make the decision of whether someone should be forgiven or not. The male nurse, who wants to try and help make the dying man's life better before he dies, by trying to contact the estranged son. The mysterious little ghetto boy, who claims to know the answer to an unsolved murder at the start of the film. All of these stories are beautifully woven together in a quilt of loss, love, darkness, hate, and remembrance. Magnolia will blow you away, and leave you thinking, hours after the DVD stops spinning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Do We Forgive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of the greatest films of all time. This is an undeniable truth. An epic of awe-inspiring proportions. Flawless, emotional, truthful and heart-wrenching. A beautiful tragedy. Paul Thomas Anderson weaves the depressing, lie-filled lives of eight people with such originality and finely-tuned beauty that he creates a story as big as life itself. Bound by his ambition, he casts an immensely underutilized slew of actors that, for the most part, have starred in his two earlier works. The true stand-out stars of this film, and it is truly hard to choose, because every single cast member creates an Oscar-worthy performance, are John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards. Reilly embodies a character filled with confidence, faith and nervousness so well, that he makes you sympathize for him like a sibling of your own. Cruise personifies the spirit of a true "On-Stage Personality". He creates such an illusion that he tries to become the depraved, womanizing chauvinist rather than what he truly is: a vulnerable spirit, trying to forget and bury his past along with himself. Hoffman and Robards truly define opposites and yet they cannot feel so cared for by the other more. Magnolia proves that cinema is still alive and it's better than ever. I would call this arguably the best film of 1999, a true competitor against Fight Club for the title. And it's all thanks to writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about love and the choices we make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a work of art following seven main, seemingly unconnected constellations of human relations, hopes, unused potentials, abused love, accusations, frustrations, regret and forgiveness. The beginning introduces the viewer to the matter of chance, the probability of an occurring coincidence against the logical development of events.One can connect the characters in groups according to some similarities in their character traits. These similarities exactly depend upon the meaning as time-lines the choices have in these peoples'lives. More precisely, whether they have already made the choices and now experience their present regrets, not having any other option but to be relieved as the end of their lives comes (Earl Partridge and Jimmy Gantor, maybe Rick Spector); or need to make choices so they use the chance they still have to end the progression of regrets (Frank T.J. Mackey, Claudia Wilson Gator, Donnie Smith, Linda Partridge, Marcie, Rose Gator); or have already made choices of acceptance so the future ahead of them brings one very painful regret less (Jim Kurring, Stanley Spector, maybe Phil Parma). Claudia is replacing her everyday reality with the hallucination and the short term acceptance of herself so she doesn't feel the disappointment, the remorse and the anger towards her wrongdoer ? Jimmy Gantor, her father. She secretly tries to punish herself by finding someone who can and is willing to "save" her and then ask him not to object nor regret if he doesn't see her again, because she is just not worth his attention, nor his care, nor his love. Donnie has been putting the pieces of his puzzle in wrong places for quite some time. He is remorseful because he doesn't seem to find the right places to put his love, and claims he is full of it. Hopelesly in love with the handsome waiter, regarding him as both his love and his idol, considering to put braces and pay for them with the money he doesn't have just to make him similar to his idol. After his parents wrongly took the money he earned due to the winning on the quiz back in his childhood days, he doesn't seem to have put his life on the desired track. Jimmy has cancer. He has only two months to go. He has no time. Besides time, he also lacks the ability to realize if he molested his daughter. The apologies for adultery directed towards his loving wife, Rose, don't really manage to wipe his regret off. It seems as if the revelation of the truth about Frank's past didn't really lead him towards realizing and accepting his regret due to growing up without a father figure which is completely normal, but not for someone as unbeatable as Frank T.J. Mackey. Life circumstances pushed him to witness the death of his father, Earl. This obviously led him to the revelation of honest feelings which, sadly, but truly, sometimes bring the anguish of the realization that we have been cheated or tricked, the revelation that we are vulnerable. Linda, driven by the extreme regret and drive to make right what she has actually done wrong in the past, tries to exclude herself from Earl's will. Her suicidal attempt, luckily, was not successful. These circumstances leave her the chance to understand her own regret and silently accept it. Knowing what she did for Earl and to herself, not being able and being ashamed while facing that same unbearable regret, vanishes the guilt to a point when it's bearable, like humidity that climbs up, culminates and then slowly drops. " ...she knew... all the stupid things I've done but the LOVE was stronger than anything you can think up. Now I'll die and I'll tell you: what? The biggest regret of my life: I let my love go..." (Earl)Choices define our lives, they define our past, present and future. The choices we are not satisfied with create our regrets. Similar to how Earl puts it in Magnolia, we have a far too long way to go with no punch. That 's the little moral story he says. The pain we feel due to our regrets will not disappear. The shame we bear will not vanish. We need to wise up so we can use our regrets timely in any way we want and then, at least try to repair things, make someone feel good or at least better and enjoy the relief and the inner peace which the good and righteous deed blesses us with. It is not that easy to judge whether we should stop forgiving, calmly decide if something is meant to be forgiven or not. This is a very hard decision to make. Probably each of us feels that in the most individual way. Rose decides not to forgive Jimmy. Donnie realizes, at least, to some extent, the false reality he has created just for himself. Frank starts to cry, finally letting his weakness show. Finally accepting his troubled childhood and moving on, wiser and less vulnerable. Stanley tells his father, Rick, that he really needs to be treated nicer. Saddly, Rick doesn't understand. This blocks Stanley. It brings disappointment, but as every other wonder and passing, this wise child accepts it by realizing that the only thing he can do is to give up. Jim "saves" Claudia. Their agreement about honesty introduces the chance that they actually "get through the pi** and the sh** and the lies that kill other people".We have to accept changes, digressions, ups and downs. We need to make choices. As the humidity climbs high from time to time, so does the never-ending spiral of making choices. If we are honest to ourselves and try to do good and nourish love, and not hurt anyone while doing that... then... then we might end up not having too many regrets after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what can only be described as an epic, poetic symphony, Paul Thomas Anderson seamlessly weaves a bounty of intricately detailed characters portraying various vignettes of coincidence, chance, human action, shared media, past history and divine intervention. Magnolia is quite easily one of the most flawless films ever made. PTA is a director who's become known for working with characters. In Hard Eight and Punch Drunk-Love he created some of the most beautifully detailed characters of all time. In Boogie Nights, he created an ensemble of unimaginably wonderful characters, all with an ocean-full of depth, and spun them all across a storyline spanning several years.For Magnolia, he used another unique style. In this one, he created a plethora of richly beautiful and flawed characters and gave them all their own uniquely incredible story to weave across. He takes on the task of giving every character their own deserved screen time, while still allowing the story to flow easily and this is where the masterful editing/soundtrack techniques come into play. PTA uses the finest editing of all time and a soundtrack (that ironically the film is based on) that is among the all-time greats, in order to keep the audience focused on the characters and their stories while giving each of them the same amount of screen time. And, as always, he succeeds admirably.I should also mention the fact that this film features possibly the greatest performance by an ensemble in the history of cinema. The highlights (and three of the four finest performances of the year) come from Melora Walters, Tom Cruise and Philip Baker Hall. Everyone is brilliant, though, just as the film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mosaic Of Stories And Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a film written, produced, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.It has an ensemble cast led by Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ricky Jay, William H. Macy, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters.The film is a mosaic of stories within 24 hours in L.A. when it's raining cats and dogs. Two parallel stories presents men that are about to die: both are estranged from a grown child and want to make contact as well as neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist. Jimmy Gator's daughter is a drug addict. A caring nurse intercedes for Earl,reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter,is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations. The movie presents themes of search for the meaning of life,happiness and forgiveness.The movie deserves all the critical praise it got when it was released.The actors' performance is worthy of that praise especially Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. Many themes are presented in the film such as regret, loneliness,the cost of failed relationships,cruelty to children and its lasting effect,all events and their results cannot be controlled but an individual can control his or her own actions, mistakes of the past cannot simply be forgotten and the limits of forgiveness.Indeed,it was a the film has many stories in one movie and presents them perfectly and flawlessly.A 10/10 indeed!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing, Unique, Captivating, Important......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films I have ever had the privilege to see, and I just saw it. It's been out for 9 years and I just saw it. First and foremost, the first few minutes of the film made me think to myself: huh?. And I'm sure they were a bit strange to others, but it makes sense as the story progresses and the lives of the different characters collide together in their efforts to understand themselves, their wants and their needs. It is a classic story of mistakes, regret, and consequences. These people portrayed on the screen are unmistakably selfish but overbearingly human and real. It is also about how experiences in our youth have an effect on how we progress as adults. Our attempts to grow-up by finding our inner-child, becoming better sons, fathers, daughters, and mothers. As Stanley says to his father towards the end, "Dad, you need to try and be nicer to me." As for the frog-raining sequence, I was surprised and a little weirded out. I was surprised to find out, however, that this sort of thing happens. There have been very rare reported cases of animals falling out of the sky during a downpour, usually if there is a tornado in effect nearby that picks-up small animals and deposits them in a near-by location. That is also one of the themes to the film: chance, coincidence, and freak-occurrences. But this film takes that to a more uplifting place, in which lives mesh together to bring people together, mend broken relationships and broken hearts. It ends on a potentially uplifting and hopeful note despite the sadness and tragedy that surrounds the story when Claudia smiles at the camera at the final moment of the film, it suggests that despite our selfishness and materialism that is so ever-present in American life, wanting to exploit children for our own personal gratification or marrying someone simply because of their salary, the cycle will never be broken until you accept responsibility for your own actions, stop blaming your kids or your parents. As Aimee Mann says: "It's not going to stop...'till you wise up." It suggests that we should set aside our wants and pursue our needs: Kindness, Love, Honesty, Integrity, Courage, Forgiveness. When we don't, as our little rapper says: "When the sunshine don't work, the good Lord bring the rain in."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a film student, nor an aspiring actor/writer/director/etc. Therefore, I also have little patience for extended run-on from those who comment on every little aspect of a film. I could be wrong, but it rubs me as smug and self-important. That said, let me get a little self-important and tell you what I thought of Magnolia, like you should care. From my extreme wealth of film knowledge, I feel there was no better written, directed, or acted film in the 90s. There, enough film jargon. Let's get to what matters to me about the film. The concept, in my opinion, is that life will catch up with you. No matter how we hide ourselves or our feelings, we will be found out and our true feelings will rise to the surface. The characters all want and need to come clean. The movie is basically saying that we all don't have scars, but rather open wounds we treat as scars. I'm not OK, and you're not OK. Let's get some closure. This, for me, is what films should be. The director has a vision and a passion. The actors are affected by this passion, and they give one of the greatest ensemble performances in film history. I simply loved every scene, and I will probably never be moved the same way or to the same degree by another movie. There, I'm done, and this will probably be the only movie I care to comment on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things fall down. People look up. And when it rains, it pours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a very nice movie. When I first watched this film I was 12 years old, at school and with my classmates, and even not understanding very much the story, I found it to be very good. Yesterday, I watched it again after 7 years, and I could get more about the metaphors and the hidden meanings of this movie.The name ''Magnolia'', even being chosen by different reasons, has the link not only because every location contains a picture or a painting of the flower, but also because if you notice the magnolia flower, the pedals are all very connected, like all the characters of this movie. One of the streets of the movie is also named '' Magnolia'' and it's there where the frog rain starts to happen first.The director wants to show us through the characters that everybody is connected, no matter how different their lives seems to be.Other important thing is about our past. People in general prefer to forget it, sometimes even forgetting the important lesson they took from that experience. Well, even many of us hating our past, it is part of us and part of who we are. Many people had bad consequences in their lives or were hurt by what people did to them in the past, and that's why the main sentence "We may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us".In Magnolia,almost all the characters are regretting something they did and feeling guilty for it. And almost all of them brought bad consequences for another character because of the wrong things they did in the past. (Example: Jimmy having molested his daughter Claudia when she was younger, made her become an adult coke head)And this also leads me to an interesting parallel: "Temeth and Claudius, the sins of the father laid upon the children''.I guess this is an alert for how parents treat and care for their children. What they will become in the future, mainly depends of how the parents treats them, and if they raise the kids in wrong way, the ones who are going to have damage are the kids. Earl Partridge left his son Frank and his sick wife alone. This makes Frank becomes not only angry and full of hate for his father, but also became a guy who doesn't treat women in a nice way and hide his true feelings.Jimmie Gator molested his daughter, what made Claudia become not only addicted to drugs(that make her feel better during a time) but also afraid of real relationships.Donnie Smith became a looser,since his parents had more interesting in the money he won in the Quiz Show, than anything else. Stanley's father was doing the same thing with him.( but in his case, he is trying to avoid the snow-ball effect telling his father to be nicer with him) Anyway,adults in general doesn't pay attention in their kids how they should (like when stanley wants to go to the bathroom and no ones cares) and this bring terrible consequences in the future for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given what we know about Tom Cruise ? his recent tom(cruise)foolery in interviews and his rejection of psychotherapy ? to see him perform this agonising slow-motion emasculation, and deliver a moment of heartbreaking emotional nakedness, is particularly remarkable. Cruise and Jason Robards, as energised son and prone father, steal this film from the rest of its dazzling cast.That cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman as an angelic nurse; Julianne Moore applying her signature glassy nervousness to a suicidal trophy wife; and William H. Macy as a lonely gay man, once a lonely child genius. Auteur Anderson was only 30 when he made Magnolia. Aside from the quirky, urban legends prologue and epilogue, one drab musical number, and a tiresome attempt at climactic surreality, the distracting, self- reflexive techniques that dogged Boogie Nights are kept to a minimum. This is mostly a mature drama about interweaving lives, regret, coincidence, reunion and redemption. The skill with which Anderson winds the various strands toward a kind of orgasmic climax of beautifully framed misery is impressive. It's easy to feel repulsed by having been seduced by this slow, tasteful manipulation, but I think it's deliberate. More than once it is repeated that one cannot escape one's past. I believe Anderson constructs his film in the same way that we romantic humans construct our memories: as if all the events in our subjective environment, and all the people, exist to serve our solipsistic story. As if recalling a dream, we retrospectively apply a poetic rhythm to all that preceded this moment, as if the indifferent universe secretly knew our fate.For me, the final animal rain event, far from drawing all the strands together, simply serves to stop them in their tracks. As a way of visualising the disinterested chaos of nature, it's long-winded; a memorable whimsy, but not a very insightful one.Anderson has said that he feels Magnolia is the greatest film he'll ever make. Perhaps it's the most personal. I would regard it as a precursor to greatness: his masterpiece, There Will Be Blood. Regardless, for a 30-year-old whippersnapper to have shown this level of mastery and intelligence in his filmmaking is rare. Put it this way: Paul W. S. Anderson had a 5-year advantage on his partial namesake, and his last film was Resident Evil: Retribution.</fullReview>

I advice the DVD fans or the cable guys to watch the movie in a quite evening because you really need to concentrate to the different perspectives of that 24 hours. During the movie you will not even have a single second to think about the final scene. In my opinion one of the masterpieces of the drama movies. Congratulations for the creative team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson. I was a big fan after only seeing one of his films- There Will Be blood, which is not only one of the best film of its decade but also one of the best of all time. I was also very pleasantly surprised by his writing and directing in Punch Drunk Love, a film that is actually quit magnificent, and had no right to be as great as it was. Here is Magnolia. This is a very entertaining, intriguing film and offers a lot of different stories. There is something incredible special in this film. It's VERY unpredictable, and Paul Thomas Anderson has written a screenplay that is one of the most original that I have seen played out. This is definitely an off-beat film, whereas sometimes it is more comedy, at other times is also equally sad and has some great characters. The ensemble cast is great, probably the highlight being Tom Cruise (who I had never seen give a great performance until now).As great as the film is, it is at it's strongest in it's middle section. It takes time for the story-telling to sink in, so after the first hour I was entranced. HOWEVER, the last hour definitely seems to drag on a bit until the amazing, and unforgettable, climax. Like I said, this is a very random film almost, but it never gets boring, and the 3-Hour running time goes by quickly. Definitely see this, but is it really a masterful work? As of now, no; it's not, not up there with there Will Be Blood, but just like Punch Drunk Love it shows how great of a modern director PTA is, and as a writer as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson has created a masterwork with MAGNOLIA. Anderson has created a dense labyrinth of overlapping stories regarding a diverse group of individual whom all ultimately interconnect on one day in Burbank. Anderson captures this with his trademark bravura camerawork and his intense (sometimes TOO intense) use of music. These stories would seem trite in almost any other context. Here, however, Anderson has brilliantly merged them. This movie begs for repeat viewings. Performances are uniformly excellent. Special note should be given Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Julianne Moore, simply because their characters walk such an emotional tightrope.The common theme of this film is redemption through confession and forgiveness. It matter little that this behavior comes devoid of religion. It is made very clear that those whom are honest with themselves are forgiven, and those whom are not, ARE NOT. The desire to forgive and be forgiven should LEAD us to religion, not the other way around; though, I'm sure, many will disagree. This is the movie AMERICAN BEAUTY should have been. Those easily offended should put aside their petty prejudices and SEE this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As coincidence would have it, the last truly great film of the century is a genuine whopper that positions itself on the inherent belief in random coincidences. Magnolia, though, is not an essay on the chaos theory--while its balls are pressed firmly against the wall, it instead digs at the less obvious nuances that make us all collectively tick. As the sublime tagline suggests, "Things fall down. People look up. And when it rains, it pours." Barrelhousing its way through Los Angeles on a single eventful day, the film is both actor and director driven, virtually plotless from beginning to end, overflowing with excess, and as long and laborious as a cardiovascular workout (and with several notable faults, but as to be expected of such a watershed). Having shown his liberal tendency to footnote in Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, Anderson patently borrows from Altman, Scorsese, even Godard and Fellini, but infuses their ghosts with a new life--even in their primes, while their narratives might have been tighter, those directors never ever had this big of a heart. Scene after scene, he taps into reservoirs of emotion that link parents and children, conflict and forgiveness, crisis and opportunity, sunshine and rain.Maintaining a daredevil grip on all of his concepts and characters, Anderson's filmmaking is magnetized with a fearlessness that, for better or worse, is unparalleled in contemporary American cinema. Additionally, one gets the impression from watching Magnolia that he would do absolutely anything for his actors, and they would do absolutely anything for him (especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, and Philip Baker Hall, all of whose work in Magnolia is easily among their best). The only worry about Anderson (Oscar-nominated for his Magnolia screenplay) is that he will never be able to top this film's artistic success. How easily, for instance, could he go the way of Spike Lee, another puzzling, ambitious filmmaker who exactly ten years before Magnolia released his own third film, Do the Right Thing, and has never been quite the same since. Time will tell, of course, but my money is on Anderson--his seeds are much too rich not to sprout. In what will in due time be regarded as one of the most eloquent expressions of human emotion ever in a movie, Anderson uses the haunting Aimee Mann song "Wise Up" as a poignant narrative thread. Mann begins by singing: "It's not what you thought / when you first began it." And given the fact that Magnolia opens with a hand-cranked camera shot of the hangman's gallows (circa 1911), and closes with a woman drenched in sunlight, smiling for the first time, I'm going to take Mann's vocals for all the comprehensive optimism they're worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAGNIFICENT. Mesmerising. MAGNOLIA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a film that jumps around between characters, locations and links that join them together, it is a tricky task to be able to tie everything up into one nice conclusion. After his debut with the under-appreciated 'Hard Eight', and experimentation with a wider cast in 'Boogie Nights', Paul Thomas Anderson took on the challenge of creating an epic mosaic of a film, following the lives of ten main characters over the course of twenty four hours in the San Fernando Valley, and tying it all together so perfectly at the end. It works. Everything works. The Acting in Magnolia is amazing, touching and truly heart-breaking. Take Tom Cruise for example; This is no doubt, the performance of his career. Deviating away from the action scene, Cruise plays a lecherous figure who gives seminars directed towards men and how they can pick up women, entitled 'Seduce and Destroy'. This character, Frank T.J. Mackey, plays-out as a result of exploitation and abuse as a child, and the 'Pied Piper' of indulgent nature, is his way of escaping the issues that have carved the course of his life. This character proves to effectively 'parallel' against Melora Walters as 'Claudia Gator' who seems to have also had a rough history with her father and has fallen into substance abuse to escape her troubles.To describe, in detail, all of the characters will take way to long as 'Magnolia' is intertwined around a series of events that occur as a result of these people, so... here is the plot in its simplest form: Two men are dying of cancer (Jason Robards, Phillip Baker Hall) one hosts a popular quiz show, the other produces it. They both have children who want nothing to do with them (Tom Cruise, Melora Walters) due to the exploitation from when they were younger. The two men also have wives (Julianne Moore, Melinda Dillon) who both struggle to cope with their husbands and the relationship with their children. A police officer named Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) falls in love with Claudia causing a catalyst for more dramatic events and Phil Pharma (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) plays an angelic nurse who takes care of Jason Robard's dying man over the course of this day. Lastly, there are two Game show kids: one is a current contestant (Jeremy Blackman) who is pressured to perform on the quiz show and must deal with anger, isolation and a caged-up nature. The other is an ex-boy genius (William H. Macy) who just wants to achieve the love of a particular bartender. All of these events combine in to one ultimately Magnificent story, reaching a climax that you won't forget.All of the characters deal with some form of isolation, guilt, path to salvation or "Sins of the fathers", on a very biblical level. This is not only presented by the Angelic/Christian figures (The Police Officer and the Nurse) but also the repetitive allusion towards the numbers '8' and '2' linking to Exodus 8:2 in the bible. This link leads to one of Cinema's finest 'What the Hell?!' moments, which will only make sense if you care enough to dig further into the film.The entire set of characters seems to be branched off from the two dying fathers, and its interesting how with each type of character that there is, there are two of them, and neither of these characters interact with one another during the film. Its spaced out so beautifully. And as discussed previously, the acting is top-notch, it is brilliant. Tom Cruise bursting into tears in an amazing performance, Phillip Baker Hall acting his ass off as he faints on set, Julianne Moore losing her temper in a pharmacy, Jason Robards' delivering a regret monologue and Phillip Seymour Hoffman attempting to subtly order Porn magazines. The acting can not be faulted, nor can the production set, the cinematography or the unique, virtuoso style of direction from Paul Thomas Anderson.Magnolia is more than a film. Its somewhat of an art-house experience, merged with an Altman-like-Hollywood style. The themes explored, the impeccable acting, the absolute beauty (contrasted with another 1999 flower film, American Beauty)is all real to its core. Aimee Mann's haunting soundtrack brings another level of depth to this film, singing about regret and loneliness, then resulting in salvation and forgiveness. 'One is the Loneliest number' travels towards an all-star cast singing of 'Wise Up', finishing with the Oscar nominated 'Save Me'. The sing-a-long may confuse many viewers, but think hard about the connection and its overall meaning to the rest of the story. To quote Ricky Jay's narrator "There are stories of coincidence and chance, of intersections and strange things told, and which is which and who only knows? And we generally say, "Well, if that was in a movie, I wouldn't believe it." But it all boils down to the idea of 'strange things happen all the time', 'the sins of the father' and how we may be through with the past... but the past ain't through with us. Magnolia is Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The intertwining and overlapping plots for these tragic and in parts comic characters are so brilliantly told and edited that you only feel a yearning to return to each one in succession to find out what the hell is happening to them. You are tortured with the drip feeding of the connections that bind them and then just when you are drained of all emotion the astounding events of the climax pummel your soul with an intensity of human feeling the like of which is ever so rarely experienced in life at large, let alone just the cinema. Grown men will weep and women will wail. Normally only Britain's Mike Leigh can take you on such an emotional roller-coaster journey of character led story telling. I urge you, no implore and beg you to seek out a copy of this movie and sit with the curtains closed and watch it without further delay. Somewhere inside this movie is a meaning for life for all people with a soul. I haven't watched this movie for five years but can't get it out of my head....and I don't care a bit. Relish every sweet or bitter moment of your existence and spread a little happiness on your way. This film will show you how. Love and free hugs to all from sunny-ish Westcliff-on-Sea, UK. from Mikey P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, I was hoping for great things from this film. And I got them. However, it was a bunch of great things, as opposed to a great whole movie.This movie is ambitous. REALLY ambitous. It attempts more in one of its storylines than most movies. So it feels a bit churlish to nitpick. However, I feel this:"Boogie Nights" was a smaller film with greater focus. "Magnolia" is larger with higher highs, but less overall success.The film never tops the first 20 minutes, probably the best single piece of filmmaking this year. After an introduction to three urban legends, "Magnolia" introduces itself. Basically this a crazy quilt of characters that all happen to be in the San Fernando Valley on one day. There are connections between them, though they all won't be connected in the end.The cast meets their challenges head on. Philip Baker Hall is always good with P.T. Anderson, and here he does some great stuff. So does Jason Robards, John C. Reilly, Julliane Moore, William H. Macy, and the quiz show kid (sorry, missed the name). Tom Cruise? Some of his best acting. An (expected) Oscar nomination would not be out of place.The photography is very varied, and some shots are just outstanding. Aimee Mann has been underappreciated as a songwriter:this film should change that, I hope.My pet peeve is that in taking on so much, "Magnolia" has trouble delivering at the same level for everyone all through the whole film. Some stories become captivating, then lose steam. Some scenes are perplexing. Some characters become awfully hard to take. Other parts carry on too long (no small thing in a long movie). The end result, for me, is neither "perfect" or "masterpiece." Just damn good.DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE:I have to say the sequence 2/3rds of the way into the movie where everyone starts singing the Aimee Mann song is genius. And the raining frogs are fantastic-best special effect of the year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Magnolia pretty much speaks for itself. This film is great ? setting aside the wonderful bravura film-making and the big surprise finale ? I love how this film makes Philip Baker Hall a crucial, main character rather than a supporting player, I love Julianne Moore's outburst in the pharmacy, I love how they used the children's game show to anchor the story amongst the numerous main characters with each their own unique and engrossing story, I love the speech Jason Robard gives about regret and finally - a lot people like Tom Cruise's performance in the seminar where he goes "Respect the c--k, tame the c--t." but I LOVE the speech Tom Cruise gives when he finally confronts a character in the film as the tone is completely unexpected and very dark. Roger Ebert said this movie is "alive" and I think that's accurate ? this is probably the strongest piece of storytelling I've watched. Better than Charlie Kaufman and I am ready to make the comparisons between Anderson as a modern day Kubrick. Good soundtrack too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>p.t. anderson's magnolia is a masterpiece, simply put. forget the opening scenes telling of the tales of coincidence and the criss-crossings of fate - this movie is about the heaviest of dramatic subjects: regret, disillusionment, and pain.anyone who saw this movie and couldn't sit still for 3 hours, and just wanted to complain about it when it was over, doesn't have the emotional maturity or intellectual capacity to savor anderson's opus. if you don't like depressing, moving dramas, don't go out and see them! your trash reviews are nothing but pure ignorance. think before you speak.there are so many truths interwoven in the dialogue of the characters in magnolia, be they officer jim kurring's, "i just try to do good" monologue, or earl partridge's stunning "regret" monologue, or the searing and satiric frank mackey, explaining, "in this life, it's not what you hope for, it's not what you deserve -- it's what you take." essentially, in this film, p.t. anderson tears open the human heart and examines its contents, both glorious and grotesque, horrifying and hopeful. every character and their subsequent plots are beautifully done, and even though the "worm" was mainly left out of the final cut, one can read about his outcome in the paperback script. each sub-plot is a cornucopia for discussion and dissection, with themes that both coincide with the other sub-plots, and that hold their own ground as stand outs. they hold each other up, and keep the movie flowing poetically.furthermore, magnolia is such a special movie i believe that those who love magnolia share a sort of occult common bond - we, the romantics, the depressed, the wretched... dogmatic believers in the human soul. it is one of those types of movies that you either love, or you hate. on the other hand, some people loved the movie and just hated the ending. (WARNING) the final scene, depicting claudia and jim, (who seems to be counseling her about her drug addiction) seems to turn off many viewers with its abrupt ending. personally, i find it to be the most poignant scene in the film; claudia smiles like the mona lisa, hopeful yet mysterious, torn between the regret and despair of the past and a new beginning. yet the twinkling of her eyes in the morning sunlight give a final resolution to each and every character in the movie, offering the prospect of hope in the greatest of all human struggles: the struggle within our past, and within our souls. it's a great ending."best damn movie i've ever seen" - man sitting behind me in the theatre as the movie was letting out.i'd have to agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am making my way down the IMDb Top 250 list, starting with some of the latest movies made in the 1990's until current. I don't know why I never heard of this movie before, but it is awesome. The one thing I didn't like was the title of the film. I thought it was a chick flick. Even though, I am a woman I don't like so-called 'chick-flicks.' There were a couple of other things I didn't like near the end. I also noticed that many other reviews disliked those two things as well. The film was otherwise excellent and profound and it deserves its rating as a minimum. I will be adding this to my DVD collection. I rented three other movies the same time I saw Magnolia and this was the only one I wanted to watch twice before I returned it to the video store. It has that "Wow!" factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magolia" for starts is not a film that's easy to like. Many people at Blockbuster have told me how "horrible" it was, and my sister hates it. I didn't really like it the first time around, mainly because of the way the characters reacted to the bizarre incident that concluded the film(I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet). However, I gave it a second chance, and I think that it's a really great movie that uses it's three hours wisely and pays off brillaintly and intelligently in the end.The film follows the lives of nine characters in a series of stories that are seamlessly interwoven together in a way that flows through perfectly and is never boring to the viewer. They seem somewhat related to each other in the actions that they are undertaking and the events happening in their lives seem coicidental and ironic with each other. However, their lives all center around one thing...they are suffering. They hate their lives, they feel their cause in life is pointless, and they seem to have lost all hope. They also feel that the world revolves around their pathetic little lives, and that they are the only ones that feel pain. Some viewers may not want to sit through the first 2 1/2 hours just to see these poor souls wallow in their own pain. Yet it's important that we see it, because people can waste their whole lives away because of how they feel and that they think they're the only person who's ever had any pain in their lives. Jason Robards' 10 minute monologue ties all their pain together, and all their feelings of regrets and losses. Boy does life suck!Then comes the ending which I wont spoil for those who haven't seen it yet. I'll only say that I believe it's a sign from God, a message to these people that they aren't the only ones on Earth and that there is a supreme being watching over all their little lives and that as far down the spiral of pain and how much hope they have lost, life still has it's rewards and happiness can still be found in the worst of lives. By showing that there is a God and that he created this world for us to live on, it suggests that we should use our lives wisely and that we are just another amazing creation of his in his world that helps maintain the balance of nature. People complain that there was no resolution that tied everyone together, but I think that it didn't have to be that way. The point of the film was a look on life, how bad it can be for people, and yet, how we as human beings can make it good and still find happiness and goodness even in the worst situations and pains of our lives. One of the very best films of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Personal Favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, "Magnolia" has been my favourite film - more precisely, for almost 6 years now (I watched it for the first time on May 13th, 2001 - I was only 13 back then). I have seen it 20 more times since then and never get sick of it - the other way around, if it's possible, I love it even more and always find a new detail I'd missed before - tell me, how many movies can amaze you so much? I can't say this is the best film ever made because, of course, I haven't seen every film ever made, but this is by far my all-time favourite. I think (I hope) I'll see more films I'll love as much as I love this, but I don't think any film will surpass "Magnolia".Paul Thomas Anderson ("Hard Eight", "Boogie Nights", "Punch-Drunk Love" and the upcoming "There Will Be Blood") created a masterpiece that touches me on so many levels. I wish I could describe in details why this film moves me this way, but I can't. Maybe it's just the extraordinary screenplay (PTA dares to mix biblical references, suicide, incest, loneliness, depression, guilt, murder and still make an oddly lyrical and uplifting film), the magnificent ensemble cast (William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Melora Walters, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Jeremy Blackman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall and the late Jason Robards), Aimee Mann's unforgettable songs (the real inspiration to PTA's script)... or maybe everyone involved was in their best days and for this reason achieved to make this puzzling, moving and unique film called "Magnolia". PTA himself said he thinks he'll never make anything as great as this again. No problem. It is an ambitious film indeed and that's not a flaw when you do have something original to offer. I wish I could add something to all the great (and not so great) things that were already said about this film. I'm afraid I don't have much to say, except that "Magnolia" is human, sad, confusing, surprising, but definitely beautiful and worth experiencing - like life itself. This is Art at its highest level, making us reflect, suffer, rejoice and have hope. And that's why I love it so much.10/10, ***** out of *****, A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciatingly Painful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was looking forward to seeing this film. My money situation was tight, so I pinched it from a friend's house, darted back home and felt as though I was in for a treat. I started watching it, and the introduction looked promising. I have no problem with long films; as long as I'm entertained I'm happy to watch a film for any amount of time. At this point, I didn't actually know it was 3 hours long, but it had only been playing for 10 minutes, and I was enjoying it. The cast looked excellent, and I enjoy films that are a bit peculiar, often dealing with a wide range of characters and how chance and fate interlaces them. So I continued watching...Then it happened. I started losing interest. Boredom took over. Daydreaming kicked in. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. And it was only getting worse. After an hour and a half I started feeling pains in my back, my arms were in agony from the frustration, but I gritted my teeth. I always finish a film I start. I checked the running time, and discovered there was over an hour left. I couldn't take any more that night.I came down the next morning, determined to finish it. And I did. And it was still excruciating. The plot was weak, the acting was average, and it was far too long. I didn't care about anyone in it. I didn't feel informed by it, I didn't enjoy it; It didn't make me think about my life from a different aspect. What it did do was make me angry. I'd wasted time. I was in physical pain from watching and suffering it. I would advise you to stay away from this at all costs. If you really have to watch it, keep a bottle of something strong nearby. A BIG bottle. Trust me, you'll need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the final PTA film I watched. I had to know if this was in fact his Magnus Opus that many people thought it was. Well, if you like his style, it probably is. But why would you like his style? Why at all?In my review of The Master, I wrote: "This director has a very rare talent. Just like in There Will Be Blood, I started watching this film full of expectations. After about 15 minutes I was irritated, after about 30 minutes I was bored, then at first I did not care anymore. I wrote this review after about 1.5 hours watching the film. Obviously I was irritated again, even angry. The director for me is totally incapable of telling a compelling story. He is totally capable of turning potentially interesting characters into one-dimensional, shallow characters." I can easily say exactly the same about Magnolia. Like in any PTA film, renowned actors act very shallow, very one-dimensional. He makes very respectable actors look like very mediocre soap actors. Magnolia is worse than PTA's others. The most extreme case is Jason Robards, playing a character who is lying on his sickbed, nearly dying. But at the same time he is talking like a normal healthy man with energetic gestures. Completely ridiculous.Then there is his direction. Throughout the film there were poor imitations of other far more superior directors. You could see bit of Kubrick and De Palma. More obvious were the imitations of the great Martin Scorsese. Including the usage of soundtrack. But where Scorsese is the master of controlled use of music, PTA's music was mostly irritating. Right from the start even extremely irritating using a very boring song for minutes that felt like forever in the opening scenes. The use of soundtrack is also one of many references to Quentin Tarantino. Apart from trying to use hip music (where Quentin Tarantino succeeded and PTA miserably failed). Magnolia was obviously an attempt to copy Pulp Fiction's brilliant multiple story lines coming together in the end. Also in this case PTA failed miserably. Boring and shallow. Magnolia is just a soap. Having all kinds of "intelligent" and philosophical discussions about this film is just as relevant and interesting as asking the famous "Who shot J.R." question.And then in Magnolia it rained frogs!!??? PTA trying to refer to Biblical Plagues? Or did he read a Stephen King novel and try to do something similar? In the last case he simply does not have the talent to pull it off. Just an absurd scene.Btw: why was this film called Magnolia? No idea at all unless this is again a sign of PTA trying to be pretentious. Because that is what he does best. Being pretentious. And shallow?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat through Magnolia on Saturday on BBC2. I saw the movie a few times when it came out but I hadn't seen it for a while and like a fine wine it has most definitely matured with age. I suppose that has something to do with the dearth of 'great' movies around today - Chicago anyone? Beautiful Mind? Do me a favour.I'm a big Altman fan. I love Short Cuts, The Player, Nashville, A Wedding;these multi stranded movies with ensemble casts, i eat em up. But what Magnolia has in spades that Altman doesn't have is heart. Magnolia's Collective heart is bursting to get out it's rib-cage.And yes, the actors do get the chance to flex their muscles. H Macy, Seymour Hoffman, Baker Hall, C Reilly, Moore, Cruise and oh yea, don't forget the legend that is Robards giving a masterclass, like it was nothing to him. I sat watching and listening to his monologues, looking at his hand reaching in vein for the pen, his eyes searching inside for the words and I'm thinking, no one could script this. The way he delivers his lines, stuttering, slurring, forgetting, yet he never once drops a word, you catch every single word. Awesome.Ensemble acting like that you never see...never...it's the best collection of performances in a single movie I have ever seen bar none.Every performance is laden with heart and soul and humanity. They are all on the money, pitched to perfection, subtle and nuanced - even Julianne Moore's wild, melodramatic turn has many levels and layers to it.Anyway...by the time the frame freezes on that beautiful final smile, and i am exhausted, spent, in need of something, a drink a cigarette I dunno...one question...where the hell were the Oscars?11/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a pop film. It won't appeal to everyone.I truly enjoyed this film despite its length and a few slow spots that appeared a bit redundant. It's a slice of life of several characters, loosely connected, similar in many ways to movies like Slackers or Shortcuts.And like those movies there's a certain chaos in the lives of the players that is expertly explored. It is fantastically honest in its approach to an often tragic, ironic, humourous, and embarrasing reality, which would seem to be a boring subject (who wants to go to movies to see 'reality'?) But it's not. Throw the old comic book notions of right and wrong out the window. Justice and redemption aren't handed out with due cause. There are no clear winners or losers. Throw that idea out as well. This film is really about exploring the grey areas in depth.The people just 'are', and we witness an extremely poignant exploration of their being.Where I feel this film gets its point across best is in how it deals with desperate, needy people on the one hand and kind, helpful people on the other. In some cases we see a partial reversal of fortune and in others we don't. Basically we can try, but we aren't gauranteed to succeed. This is best portayed between the police officer and the drug addict and between the Seduce and Destroy stud and his father.Despite a flurry of emotions that this film assaults the viewer with the plot is counterbalanced by a Vonnegut-like meaningless of life, which is spelled out in the prologue. As much as there is pain and injustice both the causes and the cures are subject much to chance, or as the film puts it: "This is something that happens."Anderson is effective both on the surface and underneath. On the one hand we feel raw emotion and on the other hand we see gesture, plot device and even deeper emotions if we look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Magnolia is one of the most unique and refreshing films which has come around in the past 10 years.it could be said that part of Magnolia's appeal is it's unexpectedness. New Line has marketed the film in a highly ambigous manner, that is to say that we are only sure of the multiple characters, and the trheme of frogs and flowers. it is not fully clear exactly what Magnolia IS, and this perhaps made it more of a success than it would have been if marketed in a straightforward manner (supposedly director PT Anderson fought for these trailers as well as the poster).Magnolia is a movie that is not easy to watch. ignoring the 3 hour 15 minute running time, even then we are left with a film that may test even the most experienced of film goers. it unrolls at a varying pace, sometimes moving in hyperdrive and sometimes very, very slowly. that is not to say that the film gets boring - there is not a single scene in this film that is not absolutley captivating. the varying pace is a bit grating at times, especially as we cut back and forth from each individual plot thread, where the paces can vary greatly. overall, however, I must say that despite this the film holds up to repeated viewings. these viewing are ALWAYS enjoyable.Magnolia is not about so much a single person as it is a place and time - multiple plot threads weave and intertwine to create less of a story than a vast and emotional mosiac (or, as New Line likes to call it, tapestry) of misery. all if the characters struggle with great odds and with each other - all with diffrent resolutions.there is a man dying of cancer at his home, with only his nurse to take care of him. he searches for his son - played with charming eccentricity by Tom Cruise - who has become a male-sex-life icon and has to not only host a seminar and conduct an interview, but deal with his father. the old man's married wife suffers a mental breakdown simultaneously.then there is the cancer-ridden game show host, Jimmy Gator, and the boy genius who has to deal with his wise-ass peers and his opressive father. watching the entire fiasco on TV is the former winner of the very same game show (What Do Kids Know?), played by William H. Macy [who is effective but doesn't stand out much from his other roles], who is getting braces to win himself a boyfriend. Macy's caracter had his prize money taken from him by his parents and was later struck by lightning, leaving him slightly mentally impaired.wandering the streets is a cop searching for salvation and a love life, which he may find in the daughter of the Jimmy Gator, who has a heavy drug addiction after being raped by a man she met in a bar. the officer must simultaniously deal with a murder case and a young boy who's advice he ignored and has to suffer the consequences.to make all this more confusing, all the stories intertwine.PT Anderson has accomplished what seems impossible here in text - all these stories make perfect sense and are truely believable. they are set up in scarcley 10 minutes, very quickly, but are automatically understandable. every performance is spot on. although not all the characters are likeable, this is necessary, because all are believable and we, the audience, become emotionally invested in them anyway. all characters are, similarly, redeemable, although it is not always clear weather or not this redemption is delivered.Magnolia has an overlying common thread of fate intervening which is set up in a fascinating opening monologe of 3 stories of intertwining fate. this sets the appropriate mood for the film although it is not, persay, the only story. each involves ideas of morals, motives, frailty, love, compassion, foolishness and regret. all of these eventually combine (in a twist that has already been given away by every other review on this site) in a wholly satisfying and believable way (although the catalyst is out of left field). Magnolia is a film that has undeniable effect and meaning on most everyone who sees it.add some really, really great songs on the soundtrack, interesting camera tricks, and you have a film that ranks among the finest of 1999, and many other years, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd best of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Of course, the best movie of 1999 being Fight Club). Given that there are over 700 comments on this movie already, I'm not going to rehash the plot. I simply have a few things to say: (May contain some minor spoilers.)1. You need to watch this movie more than once to really 'get it.' The first time I saw it there was so much going on that I found it hard to pay attention and decide what was important. I walked out of the theatre not really sure how I felt about the movie as a whole. When it came out on DVD, I bought it and proceeded to watch it a few more times. That was when it really clicked in for me. This is now one of my all time favorite movies. I could watch it over and over again. (And I do. Often.)2. Yes, there are a lot of monologues. Just listen to them. (I happen to be a big fan of monologues.) Jason Robards' monologue right before the Wise Up montage is one of my favorite monologues ever. It seriously makes me cry. Everyone is always telling us not to regret anything, but he says the exact opposite. Brilliant. P.T. Anderson can write a heck of a movie.3. This movie is about life and parent/child relationships. Jason Robards/Tom Cruise, Stanley/his father, William H. Macy/his parents, Claudia/Jimmy Gator.4. The opening scene is extremely creative, I think. (Prior to the credits.) The first time you watch, you'll be wondering where in the heck it's going. Don't worry. It wraps up nicely in the end.5. Claudia's smile at the end is a classic way to end. Given all the bull that we go through in life, there is hope. That's it.Watch this movie. Then, watch it again. This movie beats American Beauty by a long shot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Causes drowsiness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend recommended this a few weeks ago. I saw the rave reviews and the cast list and thought to myself, how did I miss this one; so I sat round a mate's house with plenty of snacks and we got started. The first few minutes give you what should be the theme/ basic concept of the film. Only one problem, its such a basic concept and should have been evident in the roughness of the introduction. This was clearly penned by a completely talentless writer director and I can't quite understand why anyone would rate this movie more than 1 star. Instead of creating a complex tale with relevant interleaving plots all that is a achieved is a pointless blur of superficially related snippets of nothing. Characters are shallow, the individual stories near none existent. This is three hours of pure torture. Some scenes drag on and on with totally pointless dialogue that give no insight into characters and do little to drive the vague plots onward. My recommendation and only because I'm being nice.. PT Anderson, go watch a few Guy Richie movies and maybe then you will get an idea how to at least link up you story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is the kind of movie that appeals to me almost instinctively, for multiple reasons. Movies of this sort are not made very often. They are very abstract and have melancholiness pervading them. Also, these movie are very niche; a majority of the audience will not appreciate their aesthetic value. Despite these seeming demerits, Magnolia is one of the most beautiful and compelling movies I have seen. Primarily a film about people, emotions and coincidences, Magnolia is a story that revolves around multiple characters. It jumps from person to person, trying its best to showcase how one small act of one person affects others at large. In the initial scenes, the narrator speaks of three peculiar coincidences that have now become urban legends, establishing the tone of the movie. Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is the host of the television show 'What Do Kids Know?' and he is about to die. His daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), is a drug-addict and hates her father. Donnie Smith (William Macy), a grown-up gay wimp who wants to get braces for the sole purpose of impressing a male bartender, is a former child-prodigy and participant of the aforementioned quiz show. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman), an immensely intelligent kid, is a current participant on the show who has an obsessive, cold and demanding man for a father. Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a male nurse attending to a bed-ridden old man dying of cancer named Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). Linda (Julianne Moore) is Earl's young, frustrated wife; his second, for the record. Earl also has a son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who has deserted him. Earl's dying wish is to meet his son. But Frank despises him. He is a cocky, megalomaniac almost misogynistic man who gives sex- seminars called Seduce and Destroy. Jim (John Reilly) is an earnest, hard-working police officer, living a single, lonely life. He is genuinely kind and wants to do good for the world. Jim ends up on Claudia's doorstep and falls in love with her, closing all characters into a, abstract yet magnificent loop. But there is more to this than first impressions convey. Besides the ones mentioned, there are even more characters in the story that have been given a considerable amount of screen time who play their part in the film. While it may appear like the proverbial 'too many cooks spoil the broth,' the case is not so. Director Paul Thomas Anderson gives sufficient screen-time to all the actors. They all have a job to do in the movie. The lead actors too aren't not just characterless, undefined gooey blobs, but working, functioning human beings. They have emotions, histories and are no more contrived than in real life. Every one of them doesn't meet the other, yet unknowingly, they affect each others' lives.All the performances are marvelous, which is a must in a movie that focuses on humans. Feelings are handled like infants; delicately and with care. The film works on emotions brilliantly. The characters are each a farrago of emotions - angst, sympathy, depression and even the occasional bout of happiness. You feel for each one of them as they tackle their personal demons. Each has a past or present that haunts him. Jimmy Gator is haunted by the things that occurred between him and his daughter. Donnie Smith by his extinct brilliance and his closet homosexuality. Stanley is depressed by the way his father treats him. Linda is resentful of cheating on Earl and loves him now that he is dying. However, the most touching of them all is the past of Frank. It isn't long before you realize that his current behaviour is a merely facade created by something that happened long back and there is something deep within that is bothering him. Tom Cruise carries this role perfectly, and tops it off with a goose-bumps raising performance in the final moments of the film, which does leave you feeling that he deserved more than just a measly Academy Awards nomination. In most artistic films I have seen, very close attention is paid to the subtleties and Magnolia follows this trend. The music, though soft in the background, blends effortlessly with the situation. It escalates tension, portrays desolateness and flows like a river over pebbles. Many of the scenes are shot in pale lights and tinged with shades of dark blue and black which is significant of the prevalent morbidity present in the characters and in their existence. It creeps into you, indulging you even more into the movie. Magnolia can be termed more of a piece of art than an entertainer. The end is highly unusual, but that just reasserts how unusual things can happen in the world. Quite nonchalantly, the film shows how we're just dots in a massive grid and how everything we do causes changes beyond measure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>but it did happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's messy, it's flawed, and it's melodramatic, and that's what makes it one of the best films ever made. I had very high expectations for Magnolia since PTA at the time was one of my favorite film-makers (he still is), and it did not disappoint. Most of the performances were great, the score was fantastic (the use of Aimee Mann was beautiful), and it was one of the most emotional rides I've ever had watching a movie. In fact, I wouldn't say it was much of a movie, it was an experience.I was completely immersed throughout the entire thing. So much so that after it ended I hadn't even realized it was 3 hours already. I was invested in just about all of the story lines. While some are better than others, all were good in their own right and I'm glad the movie didn't feel like too much of a disjointed mess. It's brilliantly written, PTA managed to blend both drama and melodrama masterfully. It also has one of my favorite endings of all time. The use of Aimee Mann's Save Me was just perfect and Claudia's smile is a beautiful yet haunting image that has really resonated with me over time. Oh, and the frog sequence was one of the most beautifully nonsensical moments in all of cinema, just like the film itself is.I absolutely love Magnolia, I love its themes, I love its characters, I love everything it represents, and I love Paul Thomas Anderson for taking such a huge risk by making it. There's a sizable group of people who dislike or even downright hate it and that's completely understandable. There's some cringe-worthy dialogue and it's self- indulgent. However, I just can't help but love it even when, sometimes, I feel I shouldn't. Personal stories/movies are usually my favorite stories/movies and this is just about as personal as it gets. It's a masterpiece, in its own Magnolia-y way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And when it rains, it pours...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film to be enjoyed on multiple levels, and the good thing is: It's entirely up to you what you want to make of it. "Magnolia" is an entry in the nowadays growing category of "hypertext movies" with no single protagonist, a film where all plots are somehow connected, interlinked and one action has an impact on another story, subtle or major, and vice versa, and so it goes with every single one of them. The result is a mosaic-like puzzle where everything forms a strange whole, patched together by the almighty power of coincidence. That is, if you want to see it that way. If you're a believer in fate you might get a very different view, or even start wondering whether it might even make sense to consider these two principles to be synonymous.There's more than just events that are linked in a 24 hours time span. One of them is the great music to be enjoyed by Aimee Mann, setting the mood, creating the links, enhancing the outstanding photography. The single stories are all worth telling, they are quirky, funny, emotional, touching, well acted and adequately paced, and make the three hours of the film's length fly by in no time. You will also find an apparent theme about parents and children, about the past that isn't through with us, even though we'd like to get rid of it, and how it all seems to come together in a storm of metaphysical epiphany, or absurdity - up to you. Heed the trailer that "warns" us, though: And when it rains, it pours... "Magnolia" has the potential to morph in front of the viewer's eye with each viewing, enriching the experience, as there are enough different aspects that demand new attention. Recommendation for first time watchers: Don't look for the big message. Just expect the unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the best film ever to come out of American cinema . . . . . . of course not the best film ever because Britain is to be taken into account. i think it is well written and astonishingly portrayed, Paul Thomas Anderson must be a clever guy. its an all in all masterpiece, some people may say that Magnolia is too long, with it being 3 hours. but i thought it was so enjoyable that it should have lasted a bit longer. Tom Cruise is one of my least favourite actors but his performance in magnolia is terrific, the only film where i have actually seen him act, Magnolia was released on Christmas day. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore deliver great performances too. we see a debut performance from Jeremy Blackman playing Stanley Spector and its possible the best acting I have ever seen from a boy that age, i can only assume that its a matter of chance. It makes Boogie Nights look only good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible achievement in film-making.Touching,raw,realistic,stunning,heart wrenching, and truly beautiful. A thousand words could describe this work of art.One of the best casts ever assembled from, Tom Cruise as a cocky and stuck up motivational who can never forgive his dying for abandoning him as a child, Julianne Moore as a sad and depressed wife to Tom Cruise's dying father,Melora Walters as a cocaine addict who hides sadness from her past by using coke,and John C. Riely as a happy but lonely cop who falls for Walters not knowing of her debasing addiction. All these people's problems intersect dramatically on a rainy day. The performances are what gives the film it's power and things from the bible: like, frogs falling from the sky and that wakes up each character to the fact that their life is a mess. Tom Cruise was amazing, and fully deserved the nomination. His best performance ever. It is a movie experience that you can never forget. Insightful, funny, sad, and poetic. A movie that reminds you of how great watching a movie can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not belong in the this site's Top 100. During the course of watching this movie, you will most likely find yourself wondering just how much longer this movie will continue -- not necessarily in a bad way, but because of seemingly pointless and excruciatingly painful dialogue (most notably Robard's wife). There's at least one character you will not care for at all (Robard's wife; acting good, writing pitiful). At times the "background music" almost completely envelopes the actor's voices making the viewing experience difficult to endure. If you were truly gripped watching this flick, you are a certified movieholic.A truly great film always makes me "feel" something, as if your soul (or spirit or human essence, whatever) is touched during specific moments throughout, or, at the film's end -- Magnolia shoots blanks, leaving you wondering if you missed something.

		<fullReview>The purpose of this comment is to provide a note of caution to people considering whether or not to watch this movie based on the high praise that it received from other reviews and ratings. I consider myself to be an average movie watcher. I rarely write comments because I don't have anything of value to add. However, I believe the high praise for this movie is so misleading that it drove me to take the time to write these words of warning. My basic criteria for enjoying a movie is whether I feel like I'm sitting there watching a movie. If I feel like I'm sitting there watching a movie, then that movie has failed my test. During Magnolia, it was struggle to watch, stay positive, and stick it out to the end. It wasn't worth it for me. I repeatedly tried to give it the opportunity to pull me in to the story lines, but I could not relate to it. I didn't understand.After the movie, the person that I watched it with made the comment "well, that was weird." Yes, that about summed it up.My basic criteria for good acting is whether I see the character in the story or whether I see an actor trying to play the character in the story. The acting in this movie was good. The characters were human. The dialogue was in English. The camera was usually in focus. But I still didn't get it.I don't understand how the story lines came together. I didn't understand the point of the individual story lines. Perhaps I am stupid or perhaps the Emperor was naked.I watched Magnolia based on positive reviews and I don't want others to be misled. So if you are not into 'weird' movies, give this one a pass because there are better things to do with your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to make a movie you're sure your viewers will see through? Facile. You just need an extraordinary account of a coincidence, preferably three, vaguely foreshadowing the ingenious wonders of story that loom ahead. Then, make sure that none of the threads are resolved, characters are bland, preoccupied with laughable problems, and don't neglect to make sure that at least half of them have a terminal disease combined with extramarital affairs.I've got to admit, though, that the concept of underlining the finale with the rain is innovative - but hardly does it compensate for the unfulfilled promise of a marvelous plot. The catch is, one does not know to let go until too much had been invested to quit.I've been robbed of three hours worth of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson; when filmophiles say the name, it is uttered with such reverence that the man may very well be canonized the contemporary patron saint of film. Offering a comparatively limited array of millennium masterpieces, PTA as he is lovingly sometimes referred to, perfectly balances his films' complex intellectual tapestry with a strong emotional core. The man is an admitted film-freak, listing influences as varied as Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Max Ophuls. Pare enough layers and you can see how PTA apes certain images from these infamous auteurs. Yet his themes are wholly their own, mixing loneliness, isolation, family dysfunction and in the case of Magnolia, cosmic coincidence as a means to his cinematic end.Magnolia follows an ensemble of interrelated and fatally flawed protagonists over a three day period. All are somehow connected to the L.A. based Partridge Productions owned by the elderly Earl Partridge (Robards). Earl is dying of cancer and asks his nurse (Hoffman) to contact his long-ignored son Frank (Cruise) who now makes his living as a professional pick-up artist. Meanwhile Partridge Production staple, the quiz show What Do Kids Know? is airing live with host Jimmy Gator (Baker Hall) who is also dying of cancer. Gator struggles to repair his relationship with his daughter Claudia (Walters) who has developed a cocaine habit and lives in relative anonymity. Meanwhile one of the show's contestants, Stanley (Blackman) is waffling under the pressure of his domineering father. The film is also book-ended by narration provided by stage magician Ricky Jay who offers further tales of the Ripley's Believe it or Not variety.I am truly at a loss of what to think about Magnolia. It's a messy, dense and demanding movie that grabs your attention through the power of sheer pathos. The common thread of resentment towards fatherly bonds certainly begs the question and offers theories about what Magnolia is about. Yet any interpretation on PTA's singular vision falls short; torn asunder by complex editing, parabolic storytelling and characters histrionics. The film is big, the film is ambitious, the film (at over three hours) can feel punishing. And in the end resolutions are left frustratingly obscured amid the chaos. Many audience members will likely feel jipped though I remind you, life itself often makes no sense; why should we presume to find intellectual cogency in our art.As we bounce energetically from one story to another, the audience is never feels lost in time, rather the film condenses and expands time in playful and interesting ways. For example: the quiz show for all its cerebral quality, is used as a stapling plot-point for most of the film's threads. Presumably the show takes place over half an hour, yet within that time, more than an hour of the film is un-spooled.Magnolia is unequivocally a minor masterpiece of world building. The film reaches its emotional apex twice; within the first 20 minutes and within the last 20. Characters fiercely clash with one another like starved rats in a cage, helped in some cases by the presence of drugs, alcohol and in Tom Cruise's case alpha-male braggadocio. After a time, the characters settle into a routine awaiting the next existential crisis that gives them grief and the audience indigestion. Tension builds and builds as heroes and villains face off. And just when you think you can't take anymore, the film rewards with a plot-point so out of left field that you'd swear the Old Testament God was smiling on Magnolia's L.A. denizens.I don't know what to think about Magnolia, but I know what I feel and I'm certain the feelings evoked by this film are purposeful and prove PTA to be a masterful storyteller. The film makes its audience run the gambit of emotional resonance, elevating its broad-stroke temperament with near operatic persistence. The camera, with its near omnipotence forces us to ask questions about the story and more importantly about ourselves. How do we control or alter our reality? When should we forgive? What problems left dormant in the past effect our lives in the present? We may not be provided with clear-cut answers but at least after watching Magnolia you may be pushed to wise up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six Degrees of Separation the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without giving anything away this movie's plot is hard to explain. Essentially, this is six degrees of separation the movie. Many characters are searching for love in California, and all of their stories are interconnected. You have a cop, a drug addict, game show contestants, a game show host, and others, all who connect with each other in some way. This movie tries to be poetic and ends up just being confusing at times, and a little pretentious. It seems that the movie relied more on its star power than the actual movie. The script is weird and often badly written. The actors do excellently, for the most part, with what they were given. Altogether, I was not a fan of this movie, as "poetic" as it was.Soundtrack: 7- The soundtrack tried to make the viewer connect more, and feel things. Instead, it just did not work within the story, and just sounded wrong against the film.Script: 2- Pretentious, and tried too hard to be something else.Originality: 8- Pieces of the script have been seen on some level, but a movie like this was definitely new.Cinematography: 7- I saw what the director was going for, but there were so many times it just didn't work.Casting: 10- So many amazing actors in this film. They did a great job. It really comes down to the fact that the script itself was bad.Acting: 10- The acting in this film is top notch. I absolutely appreciate the acting throughout. Too bad the film was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching the middle of the film I was wandering what to do ? to watch or to write. This film is three hours long and reveals the depth of the human soul, which everyone of us has reached, reaches or will reach for sure. Depth building up, constructing, carrying everything alive.Cocktail of famous actors, which we have seen in large variety of acts, including idiotic ones. But they all showed how big they are playing their serious roles in this film. Showing the seriousness and the strength, which we should have. I can not mention my favorite Tom Cruise, and the actor that plays health-officer, a role that I liked very much.The film is also for his extremely difficult profession, for "The biggest mistake that I made, was that I lost the love of my life". About that "the road is long, endless", "life is not short, it is long, too long" ? something that I was always thinking. About the moment in which the guilt comes after you, about self-pettiness and repentance. Unbelievable moments in life, ridiculous coincidences and chances. The providence. About the drugs (in Bulgarian two words ? medications and narcotics), which can only slow down painful ending.About that we can replace children with angels and vise versa, about innocence and sincerity; about the pure and well tuned harmony. This film takes you so far. And it deserves your attention! In it, one more time but in a different way we see the crystals and diamonds, the flowers, we find the flower in us which we have to look after as long as it lives. And one more thing ? this is not just a film, it is a message with which you can mark the rest of your life.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a captivating, incredibly moving and striking collection of interrelated stories about the pain, discomfort, hurt and fears of all its characters, men, women and children. The soundtrack includes many beautiful and fittings songs written and sung by Aimee Mann. Her 'It Won't Stop' (until you wise up) provides perfect advice to the characters in the various painful incidents that have been inflicted on them. The consequent emotional situations are very powerful and deeply moving. The textual weather forecasts provide no hint of the surprising and shocking climax. This is brilliant acting, story-telling and direction. I love it, every time that I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painful pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001 I wrote: "Very long (190 min.), incredibly heavy-handed music tracks, and confusing - yet, slowly - very slowly - it almost makes sense at the end. Take "Grand Canyon", make it larger in every way, remove the clarity, the sense of warmth, the connectedness, and the resolution, but somehow keep it interesting, and you've got a film I need to see again." Okay............ what I MEANT to say was I don't see how it could be any shorter in length, and still stretch us to exhaustion (well done, everyone!), the music tracks ARE heavy handed, and add to the stress and lack of clarity of scenes, which now seems to me to be one of the goals of this film. If that's true, I can't fault it for doing what it set out to do. I still agree with the comparison to "'Grand Canyon", but over the last six years, many other additional films have come out with a deeply woven plot, criss-crossing characters, slowly revealed pain, even slower revealed relationships (if any), and "resolution(s)" of the vaguest, most gut-level, inexpressible sort I've seen in any film. "Magnolia" IS a unique work ? in its style, its unwillingness to spell things out, its relentless pain and anger, its almost surreal moments, and a constant sense of fragile poetry within commonly shared, daily human issues. This is NOT a film for one or two viewings. THIS one must be revisited, and considered. Also, the quality of acting by a large cast of super stars is surprisingly non-starry. By that I mean it is easily forgotten that they are big shots, and you sink into their characters quickly. Talented, talented people abound, including Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William Macy, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall, John Reilly, and more. This film is NOT fun, but it IS a painful pleasure to be pulled in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise actually gives a credible (and wonderfully deranged) performance in this assured third feature from Boogie Nights director Paul Thomas Anderson. Also starring a fabulous ensemble that includes Julianne Moore and John C Reilly Covering 24 hours in the lives of what seems at the outset an impossibly large cast of characters, Magnolia may have video viewers reaching for the pause button in the dizzying opening scenes and making copious notes to keep track. However, as the film progresses the remarkable assurance that won Anderson such acclaim in Boogie Nights comes to the fore.Story hands baton on to story seamlessly, interweaving the lives of the disparate characters that include Cruise as a misogynistic sex-guru, Macy as a washed-up quiz-show star and Hoffman as the aspiring male nurse who wants to look after everyone. With Anderson borrowing freely from fellow auteurs Altman, Scorsese and Demme, Magnolia's finest achievement is the sheer ambition running through every vein. Anderson pulls off the ultimate coup de grace to leave viewers wondering about their own lives, mistakes and fates long after the final credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone asked me to tell them what happened in this movie. What happens to you on any given day? Maybe something interesting, maybe not... but with a population of 22,580 in the San Fernando Valley, at least eight people are bound to have the strangest day of their lives. Especially on a day when... well, you'll have to see for yourself. Probably the most shocking things I've seen in a movie that came out of Hollywood. And with Tom Cruise in it, no less.Sacrifice three hours of your life for a movie in which nothing happens - that doesn't mean it's not about anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING:Characters: -Lonely coke-head woman (Melora Walters) who was possibly molested as a child. Sits in her dark, depressing, apartment and chain-snorts lines to Aimee Mann tunes at high-volume. -Bumbling, tender-hearted cop (John C. Reilly) just wants to help folks out. Most of all, he wants that special, equally-dorky woman to love.-Crusty old game-show host (Phillip Baker Hall) facing his mortality while dealing with Cancer. He's consumed with the guilt of his infidelity and secret past with coke-head daughter.-Child genius competes on aging game-show host's quiz show. The kid has an over-bearing and uncompassionate prick of a father, hell-bent on the kid winning on the quiz-show.-Former child-star (William H. Macy) is an all-around mess, struggling with life after quiz-show fame. He's got love to give and no one to give it to.-Male chauvanist pig sex-guru (Tom Cruise) has the world and every woman at his feet. Or does he? Not after a prying reporter confronts him with his hidden past and painful family ties.These are the main characters, and most of the drama revolves around them. Julianne Moore and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are thrown in to round things out, as the grieving soon-to-be widow and teary-eyed caretaker, respectively. Moore gets some great over-the-top lines to sink her teeth into, while Hoffman delivers a reserved, low-key performance.MUCH of the movie could have been chopped out (what was with the rapping boy anyway?), but P.T. earned his final-cut authority after the BRILLIANT work he did on "Boogie Nights". This film is nowhere near as engaging, but still towers over most of the other Hollywod-schlock passing itself off as thought-provoking drama.</fullReview>

Of course it does. It's perfectly logical. You see, if it starts raining frogs then where you are is not real and it's not happening unless, of course, it's really raining frogs.

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is one of the most original and beautiful films I've seen in a while. If you like your films to be wrapped up in a nice, neat box by the end, with all the bases touched, you're probably not going to like this movie. But, that didn't bother me at all. Yes, it is kind of hodge-podge. But, so what? Each different scene offers you a unique, heart-felt slice of life. It's worth it just to see Tom Cruise go all out. During his 40 minutes or so of screen time, Cruise experiences just about every emotion possible: He's strutting in the beginning, limping in the end. He's a God among men, then hurt, grieving son. And he was just plain robbed of that Oscar. He was a force to be reckoned with in "Magnolia." Don't stress trying to figure everything out about "Magnolia." Just sit back, relax and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia, the second large release from Boogie Nights writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, offers its viewers a rather lengthy, but worthwhile, view of the lifes of 9-10 main characters living in the San Fernando Valley, California area. The movie is lengthy, but worth the investment in time. Beware however, I was slightly disappointed by the ending--which hints of Biblical proportions despite the secular nature of the first 2 hours 45 minutes of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap...with Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am disturbed by any video rental that takes up two tapes. Without exception, any time I watch a double-taper, I find myself praying for the end.This movie had some serious potential. From what I could gather, it's about coincidences (or what we believe to be coincidences).It starts out with a really interesting story about a suicide/murder. We get a glimpse into the lives of several pathetic, annoying people. A child genius pees his pants on live TV, Tom Cruise (sporting some kind of greasy Samurai hairdo) screams about respecting the male genitalia, Bill Macy fantasizes about a guy with braces, and just when you think it might all be coming to some kind of logical, blissful "tie-it-all-together" ending, IT STARTS RAINING FROGS.On a positive note, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly both gave OUTSTANDING performances. They were why I stayed with the movie throughout the painful three hours.Ultimately, I hated this movie. Nobody in the movie was better off at the end than the were in the beginning, and there was no...RESOLUTION. Maybe it was meant to be mind candy for people who love to dwell on the deep meanings of things...or maybe it really is as bad as I think it is. I just can't believe that IMDB has it listed as #50-something on the Top 250 Movies list. That's what prompted this tirade, after all. Who are these people who thought so highly of this film, and what planet are they from???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia Makes Sense if You Pay Attention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a wonderful movie. I think the acting and writing is superb. WARNING: SPOILERS!Now, as for the ending. The frog rain is easily explained, though even with the explanation it might not make sense. If you watch the movie carefully from the very beginning, you will see certain clues. The situations that the movie starts out with hold most of the clues. When the man gets hung in the black and white clip, you will see that when he drops down, he has a number on his chest. That number is 82. When the man is playing blackjack, he says he needs a two, but he gets an eight. Later in that same story, when the man that was playing blackjack gets into his airplane, the number 82 is on the side. When it shows the kid about to jump off the building, the number 82 is off to the left, made out of metal scraps and rope. When the scene shifts to the boy's parents' room, the room number is 682.Now, onto the actual movie. When the cop is getting ready to go to work, and he's listening to his voice message in the dating service, he says his box number is 82. There's many others, but I think you get the idea.Okay, what does 82 mean? In the Bible, the Book of Exodus, Book 8: Verse 2 reads something like this, "And if thou will not let my people go, I will plague all thy borders with frogs." I'm not quite sure if that's it word for word, but you get the idea.Also, in the kid's rap, the last line is, "If the Sunshine don't work, the Good Lord will bring the rain in."So basically, the frog rain is God stopping the suffering of his people, as I see it at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely recommended... but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've witnessed reactions to "Magnolia" ranging from absolute adoration to absolute loathing. It's true that this is a rather long movie, so how will you decide whether it's worth a three hour time investment? It's not for everybody, no doubt, so let me make the following suggestions so you can decide whether or not "Magnolia" will win your heart (as it did mine).I will start off by saying that "Short Cuts" is my favorite movie. If you liked "Short Cuts" then you are very likely to appreciate this movie as well. If you hated "Short Cuts", then there's probably little in this movie that will win you over.The whole of "Magnolia" is greater than the sum of its parts. The story is actually several stories which on the surface are unrelated. As the movie progresses, it becomes more apparent that the characters of the individual stories are all intertwined. They interact between stories. The major player of one story unpredictably becomes a motive force in another, seemingly unrelated story. So what you end up with is a character study where the impact of a given action is felt by every person, and not just by the person most directly involved. Likewise, it is interesting to see how different characters with different motives and in different situations react to a shared reality. What starts as a series of unrelated vignettes concludes three hours later as a cohesive story. With this as the premise, you might (correctly) suspect that this is not really light fare. Some thought is actually required (perhaps "provoked" would be the better term?)This is the same structural approach that "Short Cuts" used so successfully. The similarity ends here. Where "Short Cuts" focuses on the interactions of ordinary people in ordinary (well, comparatively ordinary) situations, most of "Magnolia's" characters don't live on your street. Rather, "Magnolia" is filled with extreme and superhuman characters: the child genius, the game show host, the dying Hollywood executive, the "how to pick up girls" motivational speaker, the christian cop, the man who was struck by lightning, the coke-snorting emotionally-unbalanced girl... As such, the conditions of the characters' existence are more extreme, and less realistic. The unfolding stories, the interactions... they are highly improbable and far fetched. However, this feeds right into the important reccurring theme of the movie, which is synchronicity, and the point at which things become SO coincidental that they appear destined or fated. Sound like fun to you?Technically, "Magnolia" is very precise and well thought out. I'd suspect that Mr. Anderson is quite the control freak, but the effect is spectacular. Details such as the "hidden" magnolia references and the portentous bible verse keep coming back. You will only appreciate them in retrospect. Likewise, "Magnolia" is an acting tour de force. I dare you not to choke up when Earl Partridge gives his deathbed monologue on the topic of "regret". Also, in my opinion this is one of Tom Cruise's finest moments (which caught me off-guard like a sucker punch, since I don't expect much from the man). And the white haired gay man in the bar, sparring with the "quiz kid"... absolute perfection.Another aspect I appreciated about "Magnolia" was Anderson's "bait and switch" strategy: provide easy conclusions that later turn out not to be true. I came to the same conclusion as the pharmacist who was suspicious of the woman who had prescriptions for many hard drugs. He was wrong, and so was I. When she told him where to go, she was speaking to me too. Wow, I was so humiliated!If you can't take a potty-mouth, then stay away from "Magnolia". I've heard and read several complaints on this issue and I can't really disagree. However, you will find redemption in the fact that one of the characters, the christian police officer, also cannot stand much cussin'.A SPOILER FOLLOWS, ALTHOUGH YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE IT AS A SPOILER UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMThe controversial cathartic event in "Magnolia" goes over the top in terms of implausibility in a movie in which implausibility is a major theme, and even though I loved "Magnolia", I felt that this scene was a bitter pill to swallow (changing my rating from 10 to 9). The mysterious bible verse refers to this phenomenon, as does the phrase on the painting in the coke-head girl's house which the camera pans in on just as the event begins ("...but it really happened"). This event actually did happen in the United States. It is another of the "too-coincidental-to-be-a-coincidence" stories, culled from old copies of "Ripley's Believe It or Not", presented as a prologue to the movie. It is a documented fact that a tornado once formed and passed over a pond populated by many frogs. The vacuum of the tornado sucked the pond water and the population of frogs high aloft and carried them a distance from the pond. When the tornado dissipated, the pond water and frogs fell to earth. The people living in a nearby town were amazed that day to see a storm which literally "rained frogs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure poetry, for when you feel sad or lost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still don´t know why do i like this movie so much. Maybe it´s the characters, the humanity in the situations, the atmosphere, maybe it´s just one of those rare movie magic moments. There are a lot of comparisons with American Beauty made ,because both movies follow a strange almost philosophical line in wich both stories are supported. I don´t know if MAGNOLIA deserved to lose against AMERICAN BEAUTY, but then again i don´t know if things should have been the other way around, because both are great films. I wished both had shared the Oscars. Anyway as the Oscares are nothing but a fake publicity stunt, who cares. :-)MAGNOLIA is a brilliant movie, not only in it´s structure, but in the beautiful moments it manages to depict among such a screenplay with a story originated in pain. The scene where everybody sing the same song, at the same time, although they aren´t aware of each others existence, must be one of the most poetic and beautiful moments in recent cinema.Then there are the fabulous, and at first glance strange characters. The casting for this movie couldn´t be better and it would be unffair to comment on anyone in particular because everybody does a superior job here, altough there are no lead characters, which is in fact one of the great things on this movie.I don´t know what else to say, realy...i would tell the story, but in fact, there is no linear plot in here, or a story actualy. MAGNOLIA is a tapstery of moments that suddenly get connected at the end, although they cross paths between each other through out the entire movie. Some might find this a very boring movie. There is no action, or anything cliché. MAGNOLIA is a fantastic and original movie, that altough sometimes it reminds us of Robert Altman´s works, nevertheless has the poetry that most of the time R.A films lack.MAGNOLIA is a beautiful poem. And although it´s a story based on pain and sadness, at the end we leave the theater with a warm heart, because of the humanity of the ending. Strangely enough i think this is the perfect movie for when we feel sad or lost. Unfortunately many people don´t get the beauty in it. I feel sorry for them.It´s a movie wich isn´t for everybody, but those who see it and are touched by it, they will never forget it. Check it out. You might end up loving it also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, when I miss to see a film that I hear is great in theaters, and I wait for it to come out on video, and anticipate a lot from the film, I get disappointed. In this case, it didn't.Well, the first thing I'd like to say about this film is this: It is INCREDIBLY ENGROSSINGLY ENTERTAINING. From the first frame till the end, I was not bored and there was not one moment I wanted to take my eyes off to just rub it or anything from staring at if for so long or change my pose while sitting on the couch, not once. The film begins and pulls you in and never lets you go. It's a film about multiple stories but I have never said to myself when the scene changes to another character, "Oh, I wanted to see what happens..." Rather, I say to myself, "Ah, Let's see what'll happens in this one..." All the stories are so well edited together and written so well that I am never dissatisfied at the way it is edited.Second: well, i'm not gonna say he's brilliant since I think everyone expects me to say it, but... oh well, what the heck, he's brilliant all right!! AND! Why wasn't this on the list of best picture nominees as well as PT Anderson's name on the best director's list? WHY is the ACADEMY so STUPID??!! I have no idea... I mean for crying out loud, SIXTH SENSE?? Arg...Well, if I had ONE negative comment here it is. Maybe the climax was TOO built up. In the middle till the end, I was almost exhausted. Almost all the shots were tracking shots and moving and music was always in the background and someone was almost always crying... Maybe a little TOO much emotion and too much music? I don't know. Maybe TOO much climax... But I still loved the film.Well, so here's my saying to you, reader. If you've seen the film, watch it again. If you haven't, watch it.

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a film that is chock full of well written and acted scenes. As a movie full of individual scenes it scores bigtime mostly because so many scenes are fascinating to watch. In the whole, it falls a little short because not all of the scenes seem necessary and some seem a little pushy, as if they were quickly rounded out to meet distribution and budget deadlines.Some scenes I found particularly interesting are the following:Frank T.J. Mackey's (Tom Cruise) interview with Gwenovier (April Grace). Cruise adeptly handles the role of a brash obnoxious scumbag who tries to save face in light of Gwenovier's demanding questions. Cruise accurately portrays the typical squirming scumbag we have seen in TV interviews when faced with a question that directly contradicts words from the scumbag's mouth. Just watch as T.J. Mackey responds whether it was ever "unclear" in regard to Gwenovier's challenge that he even attended Berkeley.The sing along of Aimee Mann's "Wise Up". This is a very moving scene and the one definitive scene that joins the movie into a coherent whole. Excellent choice.Phil Parma's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) role as nurse for dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). In particular I like Parma on the phone trying to track down T.J. Mackey. He sounds entirely authentic with his wavering, nervous voice.The frog scene.The little rapper boy (actor unknown). I like his rap that he said would help the police officer solve the case. The movie reveals his morality despite the profanity he used (and was reprimanded for by the police officer) in his rap. After all, he called 911 and saved the life of Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore). A boy with no morals would not have called for help.</fullReview>

I can see why people would chafe at the synchronistic events in the film. As somebody who has them happen every day, I can look at them in the movie and feel they're completely appropriate. Somebody who read Doctor Zhivago once went to the author and told Pasternak how unbelievable his book was, all those coincidences happening, two people separated by years meeting at precisely the right time. His answer was: you don't know Russia. That happens all the time, you expect it to happen. That's how I feel about Magnolia. The performances are all touching. If you have never met the characters PTA has created, you haven't lived. These people are real, they're in LA and SF and one or two other places. It would be easy to snipe at some of them for being over the top, but these people are all in the grips of something huge that is disrupting their lives. They're all being knocked around by the past and the present, and they're struggling to cope. I don't see this as bleak a film as some reviewers. It reminds me of American Beauty, which seems the same, but actually shows us hope, disguised as it may be as calamity. The film has beautiful moves of the camera, at times, as if the camera is a character. The way we follow the participants in the tv quiz show through the studio offices is quite good. I liked all the small ways in which the main characters are connected from scene to scene. The most obvious is the way they all sing "Wise Up". Another is that, when one scene ends with a character taking a drink, the next one starts with taking a drink. PTA is making a point, we really are related. It's a great movie to mark the end of the 1900's. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film depicting life's ups and downs, a reality we all can relate to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Magnolia 6/15 alone and unprepared with an open mind. I had no idea what this film was about or that it was over 3 hours long. If you are analytical and literal then I say this film is not for you. If you like happy, predictable stories then I say this film is not for you. If you like fantasy vs reality then this film is not for you. This film tugged at my heart strings and I grew to appreciate the characters in this film who brought out deep needs of love and acceptance and forgiveness. Tom Cruise gave a compelling performance and showed he also had heart and soul underneath the hardened person he had become. We all have acted in ways to protect our very souls and vulnerability. This film shows that life has no guarantee of always turning out right. In my opinion, the film shows us that sometimes we do not accept the truth in ourselves and it is hard to admit it(to ourselves and others). I thoroughly enjoyed this film and appreciated the way PT Anderson expanded on his characters. Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman also gave excellent performances. I saw American Beauty 5 times on the big screen and must admit that Magnolia is right up there with it. So if you are expecting a happy ending where everything turns out to your satisfaction then I would not reccomend this film to you. I am glad that there are creative writers and directors who go out on a limb to make such movies and give us another thing to ponder about the world we live in. I will be thinking of this film for a long time and have recommended it to friends, co-workers, and relatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia: Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So where does Magnolia stand? Certainly not a money-maker, nor art-house- it is a curious creature. A serious auter picture made in and influenced by Hollywood. And influenced in the best way too. People have criticized PTA for borrowing from Scorsese and Altman, but to tell you my stand, I think that it was just a natural progression. Film-makers do learn from each other. The reason why people get so angry about Magnolia's influences is that they come from very established auter's. Maniacs of the auter theory have got Scorsese's filmic style down to a T, and jump on anyone who uses a long tracking shot or character-centric style as thieving from the Hollywood master. It happened when people learned from Hitchcock too. And I would like to argue that, that is all PTA is doing- Learning, and why should we complain if he learns from very good sources! It is about time someone learned from the masters of post-classical Hollywood good and proper, and not just messed around with it. Technically, Magnolia is a revelation, hard to imagine improvements.The film is, however, a flawed masterpiece. It is a masterpiece because it gets its priorities right. It is flawed because it puts more than a few feet wrong. Content experimentation does not sit well with intense Hollywood drama. The film seems to have an identity crisis. Am I trying to be realistic? Do I want people to feel these emotions? Or am I a fantasy, there for spectacle? There are a few points in the film in which PTA suddenly makes a sudden cross-over to the bizarre and theatrical. The film is not consistent in its expectations from the audience. It asks to be taken seriously as a 'this could really happen... trust me, it could' to- 'Oh dear, no it couldn't, sorry!'I am talking of course, about 'The Song'. The film-makers reason for the songs inclusion was that it was 'the musical number'- just like in old Hollywood films where people suddenly stopped what they were doing and sang and danced about what they were feeling. As much as I respect the man, PTA is confused. Did he know what kind of film he was making? The film comes across as an altmanesque criss-cross of small stories about BIG things. The big difference is the emotional intensity. Whereas Altman was happy to let his story work its magic naturally, PTA pushes his characters to the limits of emotions. He creates atmospheres and situations that are almost beautifully unbearable in their emotional pathos. He wrote from the heart, listening to stirring music as he jotted down the script, and it shows in the finished product. Why he thought a musical number would improve the film, I have no clues on. It is actually destructive- it destroys the emotional intensity that has been building up until that point. It suddenly pulls the plug out the socket and professes that all the actors (and they are just that by the way!) were really just urinating about- the narrative at this point becomes inconsequential- retires to the background.When the song finally finishes (it seemed like an eternity) there is a desperate and quite awkward scramble to put the plug back in the socket. The reason why the film can actually get away with the song is its ability to rebuild afterwards- if it hadn't done it quite so well, I wouldn't be talking about the film in such length now. What follows is probably the most emotionally wrought sequence of events in the history of cinema. I for one have not seen any film that sustains such a punch for quite so long. It is at this point that the film really throws caution into the wind. It could have been soap opera time, a well-meaning mistake, but instead the audience becomes fully engaged in the characters' problems. This is when cinema works. This is what cinema was built for. The sound (including score) the camera angles, the editing and the mise-en-scene (especially the performances) all make this one of the peaks of modern film-making. Its achievement is as simple as it is monumental.The film gets under the skin of humanity, delves deep into its subconscious, way past it's modesty and cynicism and dives strait for the heart. Rarely before has the world's pain and beauty been so wonderfully juxtaposed in art. Perhaps this is a personal thing but... what more do you want from the cinema?As for what the film deals with, this is another case of PTA getting his priorities right. It deals with huge everyday emotions, not whether someone can stop a bomb from exploding (just in time- 00:00:01 to go...), or whether the aliens will sap our precious bodily fluids. This deals with family, evolutionary necessities and fundamental human life events such as growing up, and opening up to the world. But the main stance of the film is one of reflection, and it makes you reflect upon your own life too- taps into all those little concerns about the future, and those regrets for the past. In probably the most telling sequences of the film a dying Robards rasps about regret. Indeed, the world of Magnolia revolves not around money, or love, but regret, remorse and guilt. Emotions that destroy a persons soul, for it is a destructive world in which everything falls apart. And in a world like that, salvaging a smile is probably the most precious ability in the world.Perhaps that is why I like film, poetry, photography so much- they seem to re-assemble the world somehow and make it all simple again by structuring it all within a frame, a narrative. So where does Magnolia stand? As sure as it is technically excellent, as sure as it is thematically complex and poignant, as sure as it is emotionally draining, visually ravishing, mentally stimulating: in with the masterpieces of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best American Movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this movie was not even nominated for Best Picture is beyond me. Milestones ahead of Anderson's last film (Boogie Nights - which was good, but not great), I was totally unprepared for one of the most interesting cinematic experiences of my life (especially from a movie coming out of Hollywood.) The movie is three hours long, yet I could have gone on watching it for three more hours because the tragedy of the different characters was so interesting, and Anderson's "cinematic," rather than "literary" style of editing the film made it even more compelling to watch. This movie was vastly more imaginative than American Beauty, which I found pretentious and difficult to sit through.Whether or not Hollywood will financilly support Anderson to keep on making films like this remains to be seen. I now understand why Tom Cruise wanted to do this picture, even though his role was only one of many supporting roles.I also want to mention that the brilliant original score and the songs worked beautifully with the storyline.Perhaps I should have expected that the man who made Boogie Nights would have the guts to make an even more daring movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION: SOME PLOT DISCLOSURE BELOW!"...and in the end, this will all make sense." (taken from the trailer for Magnolia, 1999)If the flying frogs bothered you but you liked the rest of Magnolia, do yourself a favor and see this film again. I just saw it for the second time, and now it fits together beautifully in my eyes.Paul Thomas Anderson is the most ambitiously innovative young director to come along in years, and if you can't see his genius with his most recent offering, I almost feel sorry for you.I've read a lot of posts here complaining along the lines of, "The film was great until the frogs dropped from the sky." But think about it... What better way could the irony of the three short tales that open the movie be tied in with the rest of the film? There is no logical explanation one could gather from seeing a scuba diver stranded in a treetop, or from witnessing a boy being shot in the chest during a suicidal mid-flight drop, without knowing the background stories of each.Sure, the frog falling sequence is far-fetched compared to our perception of reality, but so are the original three incidents. Just because Anderson doesn't hit us over the head with a logical explanation for everything doesn't mean that it's automatically impossible. I believe the director was trying to leave the amphibian disaster as an open-ended occurrence, to allow the viewer to draw his/her own conclusion.I've drawn mine. Magnolia is the best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the modern version of the Emperors New Clothes? It is beyond me why anyone would ever deem this an epic piece of modern cinematography, because all I see is a pretentious attempt. It's not that I wasn't entertained during various parts of the movie, but looking back on it my excitement mostly sprung from the fact that I couldn't wait to see how the mighty PT. Anderson would spin these characters and their stories together in a grandiose and well-written finale. Heads up: He wouldn't. Or he couldn't? In stead, PT makes it rain effing frogs on us after three hours. To me, this does not seem like an epic ending of biblical proportions - it seems like a director/writer, who doesn't have the story-telling talent to end a movie. He instead covers up in pretentious art-fart and clichés. Magnolia is 3 hours and 8 minutes I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for Magnolia, especially after the intro, thinking it would be like Robert Altman's "Short Cuts": seemingly parallel lives intertwining in unexpected, positive or even fleeting sorts of ways. However, I was disappointed. I didn't hire the movie for the similarities with Short Cuts though. I was hoping it would be a good drama, especially as I enjoyed Boogie Nights, one of PT Anderson's previous offerings. Magnolia is a drama all right (!), but not a good one. It is boring, going on for three hours, and nothing happens quickly. (So drawn out and pretentious it should have been French!)I normally like emotional dramas and it took me a while to figure out why I didn't like Magnolia. The main problem is that there is nobody really likable in the story. They all have their demons or glaring character flaws, and hardly any redeeming qualities. OK, nobody's perfect - that's life - but you still need someone to root for, and most people aren't that despicable. The music within the film was another major turnoff. It is loud, often crowding out the dialogue, and hardly stops! Very distracting, and unnecessary (Magnolia wasn't meant to be a musical, was it?!). The scene where just about all the main characters sing along in different locations to the same song was stupid, and very embarrassing. The only plus was the acting of Tom Cruise, showing that he can tackle serious roles. The character he played was particularly loathsome, which made his part that much harder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insanely unrestrained story about death and life and obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia (1999)So brazenly inventive and brisk, it's hard not to appreciate what's happening here. And a lot is happening?this is one of those interwoven plots with several lines that join now and then. It's irreverent and tasteless, touching and glib, beautiful and engrossing. What's not to like?The most famous actor here must be Tom Cruise, who plays an outrageously incorrect man who gives cheesy, shouting seminars in how to get and girl and have sex, period. By the end you learn he's actually deeply troubled (as if you didn't guess). Other key players include Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, and William Macy?along with a huge supporting cast. Everyone matters.The jarring contradictions here are in fact all on the same level of intensity? so we have an inane game show (like Jeopardy) with a talented child contestant and a host dying of cancer. We have a prescription drug addict who is often addled and her much much older husband, also dying of cancer. There are people of real intelligence (the woman interviewing the impossibly misogynist Cruise character) and of real confusion (the nurse played by Hoffman).The movie rolls and roils, it has hilarious peaks and then sad dips of crisis. It ends slightly awkwardly, without a clear resolution, which might be a strength in the long run but I have to think twice on that. It's also a long movie, though you might not notice since it barrels along like a true roller coaster. Start it and see if you can stop. And wait for the climax?the frogs?and tell me this isn't one of the most inventive mainstream movies ever.You might ask what it's all about. Writer/director (and producer) Paul Thomas Anderson seems to not answer questions so much as use them as ways to keep us thinking. I like that. Anderson has a good eye for talent and for good stories, and he tends to take his art very seriously, which makes for a series are really strong movies under his control. I've seen most of them and this is the most edgy and flamboyant. See it, for as long as you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My God, it's full of frogs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to seeing Magnolia for ages now. There Will Be Blood was my first taste of Paul Thomas Anderson and has rapidly become one of my top five favourite films I've seen. Then I saw Punch-Drunk Love which I think is a little underrated, and then Hard Eight (or Sydney as it should've been called) which is a striking debut, and then there's Magnolia! Many cite it as the best film ever made and Paul himself has even gone on record saying that he'll never do a film as good as Magnolia again. That could well be true.Whilst at the time of writing, I still do prefer There Will Be Blood, there's no denying the marvel of Magnolia. Its sheer audacity is enough to be respected, yet somehow Paul Thomas Anderson (why is his name so frigging long? I'm just going to call him Paul) manages to handle this great big beast he's created with flawless ease. Magnolia is basically like Love Actually with lots of little separate stories going on which are loosely inter-connected with each other. However, Paul isn't too concerned with love. He's more interested in the bleaker side of life such as: child abuse, drug addiction, rejection, loneliness and regret. For most people, the idea of a three hour long film with all these themes would be a turn off. However, I'd urge you to stick with it.To be honest, I loved Magnolia from the moment it began. It tells three stories within the first five minutes in the whimsical style of Amelie. They're expertly told, but also quite misleading. We're lead to believe that the big story which is about to follow will end in a way which connects all the characters, but it never does. Or at least, they don't come together as explicitly as the first three stories told. These first five minutes would make a superb short film of its own, alas it's just a warm-up for the main event. Suddenly the depressing One is the Loneliest Number starts to play as the titles bloom out of a brilliant magnolia flower.Magnolia has over ten main characters and by some sort of miracle, Paul manages to develop each one deeply. Each character is so rich with detail and each has a story which manages to be thoroughly engaging and entertaining. If I were to mention what I loved about each character and their story then this review would probably be as long as the screenplay for Magnolia, so I'll just mention a couple of my absolute favourites. Probably the most extraordinary character arc is Tom Cruise's character, Frank. We despise him at the start with his disgusting misogynistic ramblings, however as his arc goes on we see him turn from cocky a prat into a vengeful and weeping little boy. Paul gives us just enough to suggest why his character is the way he is, yet leaves enough ambiguity to let us come to our own conclusions.Another fascinating character is Donnie Smith, the child star who's now all grown up and forgotten. His story is arguably the most moving. He's a drunk whose lost his job and is hopelessly in love with a barman who doesn't love him back. One of the saddest parts of the film, for me, was when Donnie got drunk at the bar and started rambling about how much love he had to give. What makes all these stories so engaging is that they're all so identifiable, or at least will be. We've all felt alone, we've all felt love, we'll all have to cope with dying or seeing a loved one die etc. this is perhaps the secret to Magnolia's greatness.The acting is also brilliant across the board. Tom Cruise is an actor I normally can't stand, yet here he's Oscar-worthy. He's been given such a complex character to play and he plays it with terrifying ease. The iconic moment when he confesses his hatred to his dying father feels almost too real. Julianne Moore is also another one who stands out. Her hysterical suicidal outbursts are almost exemplary. I also loved Philip Baker Hall as the game show host dying of cancer. At first he's a character who you feel deep sympathy for until you find out the dark secret he's harbouring. The scene where he confesses his secrets to his wife is another stand-out moment.Paul's directing is nothing short of masterful, as ever. It might not have the same Kubrickian shots like, Punch-Drunk Love and There Will Be Blood had but there is still a distinct style which holds the film together. I loved the long and involving tracking shots and some of the editing was extraordinary. At times it reminded me of a Christopher Nolan film as there are several powerful moments in Magnolia where stories all come together with one character narrating over a different unconnected image involving another character. It's difficult to explain, but it works and creates a superb mood. There's even an inspired moment where all the characters burst into song, thus unifying them even further.Magnolia really is the definition of a masterpiece. You can tell that Paul set out to create the greatest film ever made and he has pretty much succeeded. It's such a magnificently rich, deep and emotional film. In fact, it's so deep that it would take you at least three viewings to totally appreciate it all. It's a brave piece of work and even features a moment of bizarre surrealism towards the end which should feel completely out of place, but doesn't. Magnolia works on so many levels. It's not so pretentious that it's inaccessible to average movie-going audiences, however if you want to dig deeper into it then there's more than enough there to allow it. I certainly can't wait to experience it all again.</fullReview>

Extremely hipster in content.None of the characters were relatable and they were all sad blokes who whined throughout the movie without doing anything to help themselves.Watching this was a like a soap opera x 10. There is so much needless crying. At one point I wanted some of the characters to die especially the elderly man in hospice care who rambled off pointless life screw ups.All sympathy from the characters is negated because some of their problems aren't very severe..for example William H Macy's character who wants braces to hit on his man crush...really? Your past 50 not 13..get over your problems and learn to cope like an adult. The viewer is never given a window inside the lives of the characters who are suffering from depression and extreme regret.Instead were just expected to feel sorry for them. As stated before to make it worse none of the characters really try to fix their problems..just whining.The soundtrack is horrendous. There is random opera themed music throughout character dialogues. The transitions in the movie are very sporadic and character dialogues devolve into random conversations that don't push the script anywhere.The only thing good about this movie was Tom Cruises character who delivers funny lines here and there. Other than that please save yourself from this 3 hour poor me fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, Magnolia is the perfect film for cinephiles. It has many narratives embedded in one lengthy film that's longer than three hours and is extremely character-driven. I personally found this film to be very interesting and captivating. I can see why people would be turned away from this film, but that is the beauty of Paul Thomas Anderson. He directs films that pushes the boundaries and he creates something new and exquisite. Not all filmgoers, especially the mainstream audience would be all too pleased about that.Anderson's film has a very difficult plot to describe. It has all these stories that are interwoven and how each character is somehow related to the other characters. It's a passionate story that talks about the meaning of life and the ups and downs of life. There is a police officer, a game show host, a former quiz show winner, a sex maniac, and so on.This film has lots of quality actors that give excellent, intense performances. I have to give a lot of credit to Tom Cruise. He goes out of his comfort realm to play a role like he had and he has a nearly perfect performance. You would expect to see John C. Reilly as a funnyman, but he does very well in his dramatic role. The other actors like Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman all do well.Overall, this is a very interesting if not somewhat polarizing film. Critics adored this film, but the mainstream had very mixed responses. Personally, I really liked the film and the story held me in despite the long running time. It may be somewhat bloated, but I give thanks to the stories for not running out of steam. This is a powerful film that will play with your emotions. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson is a director who doesn't do small. "Magnolia" is about as big a movie as you can imagine, and often in danger of slipping off the tracks, but watching it is an immersive experience you will not soon forget - or want to.How to summarize? Um, okay, there are these people in various states of life, dealing with various boiling points in idiosyncratic fashion. A cop (John C. Reilly) is trying to make time with a girl on the edge (Melora Walters). An ultra-bright child (Jeremy Blackman) suffers from humiliation on live television. A TV producer (Jason Robards) lies dying while his huckster son (Tom Cruise) lives in misogynistic denial. And on and on, various tangents threaded loosely but intrinsically together. Eventually, the whole thing reaches a critical mass, with even the sky weighing in to pass judgment.No description of "Magnolia" can do justice to the experience of taking it in. That's not meant altogether as praise. Making its subject a day in the life of assorted people with often tangential connections becomes a license for narrative sprawl and cinematic excess. There's too much shouting and dramatic underscoring. A plot point involving a murder is casually dumped for lack of time. Emotions are ramped up, especially when Julianne Moore is on screen as Robards' wife, freaking out without letup. Moore is a great actress, but she's not great here.About everyone else is great, though all have their moments of excess. It's the price you pay for their company. Cruise nails his part with Christian Bale zeal, getting under the bone with what might be called Jerry Maguire's evil twin. His advice to a pack of wolf-whistling lonely men is to be a total dog with women, in a series of lessons that include "How To Fake Like You Are Nice And Caring" and "How To Turn Your 'Friend' Into Your Sperm Receptacle."Anderson and cinematographer Robert Elswit create a dizzying array of masterful shots, with crane views, quick pans that stop on a dime, and a series of long tracking shots on the set of the hyper-tense game show "What Do Kids Know?" It's show-off bravado, yes, but incredibly engaging work that makes a three-hour-ten-minute movie zoom by like a music video.Anderson's not just a plate-spinner but an artist of empathy and depth. Watching Robards dying of cancer (it's the character he plays, Earl Partridge, who is dying, but Robards himself would be dead just over a year after the film's release) makes me flash on my own father's last days, and his brave performance makes for grueling, cathartic viewing.What is the film about? With all due respect to the Book of Exodus and an opening sequence advancing the idea nothing is coincidental, the core message seems to be about love. "Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame and it's all in vain to call it if it chooses to refuse" is a quote from Bizet's "Carmen" used here, perhaps a nod in the direction of another movie about childhood heartbreak in Southern California, "The Bad News Bears". Watching people deal with love, and its nasty flip side, regret, is a continued subject of "Magnolia", and, in the end, its one enduring if uncertain grace note.But summarizing this film, as I said, is an exercise in futility. Watching it can be painful, too, and confusing in ways a tighter focus might have solved. But this is a film you feel in your bones, to the point where it may have you replaying scenes in your head. Not a perfect film, but a singular experience, "Magnolia" is for the heart and head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this three times in the last few days, and I feel like watching it again as I write this. It's extremely complex; even more so than the other Paul Thomas Anderson movies. I know how I feel about it, but it's almost impossible to communicate it with words. &nbsp;There are so many characters and so many loosely connected plot lines, but I &nbsp;never once felt lost. The fact that this three hour movie never once feels tedious or drawn-out, is absolutely amazing. It's incredibly easy to watch and get swept up in the events of these people's lives. Some of them are much more interesting than others. A few of the characters and story lines held little interest for me, but what John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, and (especially) Melora Walters do here is just amazing. I never thought I'd see a movie with Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy in it where they weren't the best actors, but as good as they were, they can't hold a candle to the three performances I just mentioned.This isn't for everyone. That's an understatement. Some people will find it pretentious. Others, will find certain events absurd. And most people will find themselves searching for the meaning of it all, after it ends. Magnolia is the kind of movie that requires repeated viewings, so be aware of that. Every single time I've watched it, I've understood and loved it a little bit more. Once you watch that final scene and feel something click inside you, you'll know that you've seen something special. Something so ambitious and unique that there's really little I can compare it to. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is said by some to be a classic. In some ways, this is true, but several flaws keep it from being a classic film. Instead it's just a very original, mostly interesting movie.Where most connecting anthology films have a big connection between the stories,this one has slim connections, which is what makes this unique. "Magnolia" runs more by the 6 degrees idea, where each character is somehow connected in a small way to the other ones. There is no overall plot, but about 6 or 7 different ones. The characters is what makes this really interesting, because none of the plots are extremely unique. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is a dying man longing to see his estranged son. Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his nurse, is lovingly helping him search. Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is Earl's emotionally unstable trophy wife who, only now that Earl is dying, realizes how much she loves him. Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) is a speaker who helps give men tips to get women. He is Phil's estranged son. Jim (John C. Reilly) is a cop who has fallen in love with Claudia (Melora Walters), even though he knows nothing of her drug addictions. Claudia's father is Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall), host of a popular game show, and he is dying of cancer. Only on his death bed, does he confide information in his wife. Stanley is a regular child contestant, and child prodigy who is not respected by his father or his less talented peers. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) used to be a contestant on Gator's game show, but now is poor. He is infatuated with a male bartender.As one can figure, there are a lot of characters and a lot of plots, and because of the nonstop jumps from plot to plot, this rarely gets boring. Also because of this however, the characters are harder to relate to. The music in the background can get annoying and instead of feeling like several plots, this sometimes felt like a never ending montage. It's over 3 hours, and can drag, but the time helps the underdeveloped characters become more developed.Overall, this is a long, usually interesting, very original movie based on characters instead of plot.My rating: *** out of ****. 188 mins. R for language, and drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson must be one heck of an actor's director. Here, almost the entire cast of Boogie Nights get back together, taking Tom Cruise and Jason Robards along for the ride, and tell us some stories about weird and wonderful events that 'just happen'. This movie is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. Intellectually it doesn't make any sense: what's the point? where's the resolution? what's with the frogs? Magnolia's closest relative is Altman's Short Cuts, but this is so much further off the wall that it's not even in China. First of all, the script is based on songs by Aimee Mann. Now, a lot of people have never even heard of Aimee Mann, so to follow up a hugely successful movie like Boogie Nights with a film based on her songs is daring to say the least. Then there's the bit where every story is put on hold while the characters have a wee sing song to Mann's lovely song "Wise up". And then it starts raining frogs.It's not all unconventional. There's a number of recurring themes that tie the various stories together, the most obvious being the various ways in which children can be screwed over by their parents. The characters fall into neat categories: angelic heroes (Hoffman, Reilly, Dillon), sinful and sorry (Robards, Moore, Hall), and screwed up victims (Cruise, Macy, Walters). Most of the plot threads do come to some sort of resolution, although there is not one truly happy ending.I don't have room here to talk about every performance but suffice it to say they are all excellent, with Hoffman and Cruise the standouts. This is as good a reason to watch the film as any, as there's no all encompassing message or point other than "Stuff happens, and life goes on".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long, detailed, epic film, filled with some truly moving performances, though certainly not for everyone. From start to finish you do not know whether to laugh or cry, whether to believe or disbelieve, or even who to like and who to hate. This film made up of a collage of stories that look into just one day in the lives of a group of people who have put off some long-needed soul-searching, and the events that force them to face their painful pasts. Everyone has something to hide and miles of roads of healing they need to walk before they can live their lives in peace; but, on this day, nothing, it seems, is impossible and no secret is too sacred to be unearthed. Or, to put it as the movie often does (in what seems to be a reinterpretation of a passage from the Bible), "We may be through with the past; but, the past ain't through with us." I implore you to see "Magnolia", even if you wind up not liking it. It is truly a unique experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Masterpiece (Very Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare that I find time in my busy schedule to write a review for the Internet Movie Database. But Magnolia had to merit a review. This masterpiece is so beautiful that it is one of the few that deserves a review. First of all, there is the writing. With the most unique characters since Pulp Fiction, P. T. Anderson has proved himself to be William Shakespeare of the modern age. In fact, this movie was written so well that from about the point when Linda reveals her love for Earl, there was a tear in my eye for the rest of the film. No good movie would work without actors. This ensemble was perfect in every way possible. All of these powerful actors were perfectly cast, and none of them got one note wrong. The performances were perfect. Obviously, this film is a masterpiece and deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. To show the scope of this film's magnificence, refer to what Ricky Jay says at the beginning. As he is talking about coincidences, he says things such as: "This cannot be "one of those things"..." And it's not. It's the masterpiece that's like a needle in a haystack. There's only one in a million and it only comes up once. Magnolia is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One is the loneliest number.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's multi character study of jumbled, interconnected lives and loves of the San Fernando valley is perhaps the last great film of the nineties, but deserves to be hailed as one of the best ever made. It's a film that a lot of people aren't going to like, because in today's world of rapid fire cuts and quick resolution Magnolia is a film out of place, arching back to the days of the seventies story driven filmmaking. Magnolia is a funny, touching, and engrossing film, from the "A matter of chance" opening and onto the above quoted "one is the loneliest number" intro theme as the films sets up the characters, the mood and the style that will be employed throughout. The characters themselves are a cross reference of dropouts, dead beats, and losers, brought together by a set of unpredictable events that occur over the majority of one day. First up, there's Claudia (Melora Walters), a young woman with a serious drug problem, her TV game show host father Jimmy (Phillip Baker Hall), a young boy genius from Jimmy's show (Jeremy Blackman), a former boy genius (William H. Macy) an idealistic cop Jim (John C. Riley), and the story of a dying man Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) his trophy wife Linda (Julianne Moore) and his missing son, sex guru Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise).From there the film slowly brings the characters together. Anderson never letting the characters become to boring, they always have something to say. Carried together by some wonderful music, using Aimee Mann songs in the same way the Harold and Maude (1971) used Cat Stevens, or the Graduate (1967) used Simon and Garfunkle. There's so much in this film that's worth pointing out, that's worth re-watching the film just to experience these fantastic performances. SPOILER Warning.Standout moments would have to be Donnie Smith's (Macey) breakdown in the bar ("You wanna love me Brad, I'll be good to you, I'll be god damn good to you") as he confesses his love to a bemused young bartender. Then there's young Stanley Spector (new comer Blackman) as he also suffers a similar breakdown on live TV, letting it become all the more obvious that Donnie Smith is Stanley, or at least how he would turn out years later. Then there's cancer ridden Jimmy giving away the answers before collapsing ("Play us a ditty fellas")... There's so much more, Jim and Claudia's date, Frank's "Seduce and Destroy" seminar. Everything is fantastically realised by Anderson and the filmmakers.Magnolia is a well written, well made and beautifully acted (check out Phillip Seymour Hoffman's subtle display of emotion after he cleans up after Earl at the end of the movie). It holds you right from the start, never letting go until the end credits and Claudia's ironic smile, summing up the film in one small gesture, and - as the book says, "We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us. And in the words of this humble reviewer, this cannot be one of those things; this surly cannot be that...Remarkable 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is an excellent insight into the depression of nine San Fernando Valley residents. On a day that almost foreshadows a cataclysmic event, nine people must deal with guilt, remembrance, death, depression, and the everyday challenges we face in life, and these all stand-out thanks in part to a brilliant ensemble cast of actors.The movie begins with pieces of bizarre coincidence stories that opens the film's morbid and off-kilter tone, moving onto the lives of those nine main characters. There's the lovable, bumbling, lonely L.A.P.D. officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, who's acting was sorely overlooked by the Oscar Academy), masculinity motivational/infomercial guru Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise, in his more brilliant roles), TV quiz-show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), his estranged, coke-addicted daughter Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), dying TV mogul Earl Partridge (Jason Robards, in his final film role), his young trophy wife Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore), who's on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Earl's caring male nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman), young quiz-show prodigy Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), who's pressured by his money-hungry father Rick (Michael Bowen), and aged Quiz-kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a loser who's orthodontics work might hopefully land him a relationship with a gay bartender.Director P.T. Anderson has a great way of pulling the viewer into this movie; the beginning really can pull the viewer in, then the film stretches out with the related stories of the characters' day. And the kind of mid-way point is when each character croons a snippet of Aimee Mann's brilliant song "Wise Up," which is a truly excellent point in the film.The ending is from left field: I expected something was going to happen, but I didn't expect frogs. I liked the frogs. It was showing these people that they're killing themselves--frogs are really messed up, and they're telling these people that. It also seemed that these frogs are telling us that though there are problems that seem unavoidable, there are worse things that happen. And the choice of frogs was an excellent idea on P.T. Anderson's behalf.I liked "Magnolia" because of it's emotional integrity and sincere portrait of American life. This film shows that life happens, and it's up to you to help yourself. "Magnolia" is an instant classic, and I give it a 10 out of 10. It's one of those films that touches the heart and is a treasure in the threshold of Hollywood cinematic excellency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius with a message..SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. I'm a huge movie fan and I watch 3-4 movies per week on average. And therein may lie the clue to its enjoyment. The average movie goer may see one flick a week at the most and provide the box office fuel for such tripe as Godzilla and Deuce Bigalow. This movie isn't for those kinds of John Doe "block buster" movie goers. This movie is for true fans of film as art in the style of Scorsese and Altman. It isn't your standard movie experience. If a long unconventional movie isn't your thing, avoid avoid avoid.The movie's theme is the tragic result of self centered-ness. The kind that is so prevalent in post WWII America. The theme seems to be lost on so many of the viewers I saw the film with, as well as many of the reviewers here on imdb. That we are shown at least 9 different people going through this self centered-ness is a vital element to the film. It shows the pervasiveness with which this self absorption exists in our society. In the film it occurs within the span of one day, in one city in 9 different lives. To say life isn't this bad, or that people just aren't this desperate or self absorbed in this day and age is to just have blinders in. People will blast this movie and then leave the theater to blow up at someone who cut them off on the freeway, then drop their 2 year old off at all day day care, oblivious to the failure of their own lives. The manifestations of this kind of life are shown in glorious, overblown detail: drug addiction, blind careerism, selfishness, parents pushing their kids to excel, molestation, adultery. The heart is hardened in every way possible and the capacity to truly love is shut out. The results, as shown in brilliant performances by Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall, are agonizing regret and guilt towards the end of life. The brilliant Biblical allegory towards the end of the film (which to my utter surprise several people did not get ..."what's with the frogs"? I heard several people say)only goes to hammer these points home. Reprehensible lives such as these are worthy of a plague.At least to me, this film serves to drive the same point home as "American Beauty" did: Love, compassion and beauty are the only things that matter in life, not the careers, material gains and self pleasures we surround ourselves with. There is certainly a stylistic difference between the two films. AB is thoroughly realistic, Magnolia drives its message home with parody and occasional over-acting to brilliant effect. I mean come on people, look at the Tom Cruise seminar in the hotel..the material in the package he sells. It's obvious this over dramatization is not realistic, it is meant to prove a point.I do have one minor complaint, and that is certain parts of the film where Aimee Mann's songs are used. I'm not referring to the cast sing along of Wise Up which I though was brilliant, but to the use of Momentum and One. At certain points the songs are playing top volume, at the same time the score is playing beneath, and then dialogue on top of that. I found this to be very distracting and annoying. This isn't a slight against Mann, who is a songwriter on par with Lennon or Dylan, but the effect was a little too overwhelming.So you will either revel in the overblowness of it all, and get the message, or see the film as a contrived jarring mess. Maybe some of us could open our minds to see the former.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, terribly self-conscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a line Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) says, something to the effect of "Life isn't short, it's long." That was at about the 2 hour mark, and I thought, "Yeah, so is this movie." "Magnolia" was an interesting idea, and there's some good stuff in it. Some of the acting is first rate (Julianne Moore, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, and Melinda Dillon). Much has been made of Tom Cruise's performance, but I think he over-acts, especially in his big scene with Jason Robards.One of the main problems is that the script tries to do too much. Some editing would have helped, like maybe limiting it to 2 or 3 of these stories. I would have cut the plot involving William Macy's character. Focusing on one whiz kid should have been enough. I also thought the subplot with Claudia and Jim the cop was pretty unbelievable. It was difficult for me to care much about their potential relationship since it seemed obviously doomed. There were just too many balls being juggled at once in this story.I also had a problem with PT Anderson's direction. Very showy and self-indulgent, constantly calling attention to himself with his quick cuts from plot to plot and flashy camera angles. He really dragged out the big decisions made by the various characters: Cruise hanging on the phone with his assistant, the whiz kid's big speech, Moore unloading her guilt on everyone. The whole pacing of the film seemed off in the last hour.Then there's the big pay-off, which I found ridiculous. While others attribute lots of hidden meaning to it, I found it pretty pointless. Really the film's message can be simply summed up with "coincidences happen, and you can't escape your past".Basically I think "Magnolia is an over-rated film, worth watching once, but not worth all the reverence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What this movie is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a couple of people wondering what this movie is about and why it's chopped into pieces of people's lives. This film is about Love and the way people see it, feel it and live it. If you look close enough you'll see that each of us filters emotions different and although we generally gain the same perception about a feeling, we experience it differently, and this whole movie revolves around how a handful of people put their lives for display.You've probably been told at a point that there are no normal people in this world, there's just people you don't know well enough. This movie depicts that, the twisted, ugly, denatured lives of people, each of us has a sum of experiences, feelings, things we've learnt and some things that we don't like about ourselves, we feel there's a monster or some sort of curse on us for having gone through those things or for having been the cause of those things. And then forgiveness comes into play, because I guess that's the first step to Love, forgiving yourself, or forgiving others.So the truth is, until you look deep within you and learn what and who you are, you're probably not going to understand this movie for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most ambitious movies of the 1990s. Not 100% successful, but packs a strong emotional punch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Magnolia' seems to be a case of Paul Thomas Anderson trying to outdo himself, and make a "better" and more "important" movie than his masterpiece 'Boogie Nights'. In several places it feels contrived, and the much larger canvas and greater number of characters might dazzle the viewer technically but don't always convince. However many sequences really work and have an emotional honesty rarely seen in contemporary Hollywood movies. In fact if I think you approach this movie emotionally and not intellectually you will find it a lot more rewarding. The gimmicky opening sequence narrated by Ricky Jay, and the much discussed Charles Fort inspired climax were dismissed by many, but I thought they were wonderful, and really effective. Better still was the group singalong in the middle of the picture, which literally had me bawling like a baby. Anderson assembled an outstanding cast of actors, some of which he'd worked with before (especially the core of Reilly, Hoffman, Hall and Walters), some not (Tom Cruise, legendary character actor Jason Robards). All of them have some outstanding moments, but I was especially impressed by the scenes between Robards and Hoffman, and those between Reilly and Walters. I also really liked Macy and Henry Gibson's bar scene, and Philip Baker Hall was excellent throughout. If I was being critical I could single out a handful of scenes which just didn't work for me, but overall there are many more good things about this movie than bad ones, and I applaud Anderson for trying to make a serious drama aimed at adults rather than an empty FX filled blockbuster aimed at kids. I don't think 'Magnolia' is 100% successful, but it's heart is in the right place, and when it is good, it is very, very good. A movie that every serious film fan should watch.</fullReview>

I think that its design is very similar to a French movie called "mercredi folle journée" (2001) made by Pascal Thomas. The two movies were shot in the same way although the quoted movie was launched after "Magnolia": they are built around several little stories that cope with each other and they are solved individually.Otherwise, Paul Thomas Anderson's movie remains pleasant and sometimes inventive in its directing. It enjoys a correct performance and the director shows compassion and even tenderness for his characters. You can also see through his movie a bitter and cynical critic of the American society and more particularly of the American television (what do the kids now?).A good movie? Yes. A masterpiece? Not really...</fullReview>

And then it goes to more scenes where they keep elaborating on things you picked up in the first hour. And then they elaborate more. .and more, and then 3 hours have gone by and they're STILL elaborating.And then it drags on more and more. .It's like his mind was going in so many directions that he could never focus to get his point across in a scene, much less the movie.

I just think HE needs a LOT of direction. If I remember correctly, Boogie Nights was LONG also. Just b/c a movie is 3 hours long doesn't make it an epic.

There were just too much characters that actually did not have anything to do with each other. I don't have the feeling that all this complexity told me something - or it should have been that life is a wrestle for some, that we meet people on the way, and strange things happen not only in movies.

		<fullReview>In his back-to-back first features in 1997, Paul Thomas Anderson came on strong with HARD EIGHT and BOOGIE NIGHTS to ding the bell as the most prodigious new artist in American movies since the birth pangs of Martin Scorsese. So how did Anderson follow up a masterpiece with a work as misconceived, unfocussed, unconvincing and sheerly interminable as MAGNOLIA? With a chill, one recalls Pauline Kael's words on Mike Nichols' CATCH-22: "It was hugely anticipated and then instantly forgotten."The movie kicks off with a bang, with an anthology of short tales of improbable death and strange coincidence, shot and narrated in a bruising, hurtling style that suggests one of David Mamet's oracular anecdotes given the Scorsese benzedrine treatment. But then the Short Cutsish cast of characters is introduced in a brain-battering, headlong montage, with Aimee Mann's cover of Three Dog Night's "One" covering up the dialogue, and what Anderson must have been aiming at--a dizzying opener in the manner of the montage that begins CASINO--winds up seeming like something from Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO AND JULIET. You can feel that something is off--this isn't the pitch-perfect world of BOOGIE NIGHTS, where every scene seemed right down to the tiniest beats. The "naturalistic" world of this movie, a universe of living rooms, cheap apartment buildings, game-show sets and hotel suites, seems infinitely faker than the porno fantasyland of BOOGIE NIGHTS. And the storylines themselves emerge reality-deficient. Critics who carped that the Sturges-like cast of screwballs in BOOGIE NIGHTS were one-dimensional will shudder to encounter this crew.Without going into the eight or so plots that make up the movie, I'll just note that the "theme" that slowly emerges (somewhere after two hours pass) is that parents are innately bad--they always manage to cannibalize or torment their children to the point of irreversible harm. The fantasy good-guy dads in HARD EIGHT and BOOGIE NIGHTS are nowhere to be found here; instead, there's a game-show producer (Jason Robards) who dumps his cancer-riddled wife for a young chippie (Julianne Moore) and lives to regret it when the Big C comes a-callin'. (Moore's bedside conversion from trophy wife to penitent happens offscreen, and seems no less the ridiculous for it.) And a game-show host (Philip Baker Hall) also gets cancer, and a terrible secret about him and his daughter--can you guess?--is slowly revealed, hours after we've figured it out. The only tangible emotion you can pull out of MAGNOLIA is that Anderson, once a PA for a kids' game show, wishes lymphoma on all the old guys he worked for.There are moments. John C. Reilly is sublime as a good-hearted cop who seems to live to impart tough love on every sad sack in the world; his scenes with a terminally screwed-up Melora Walters have the screwy, awkward tenderness of the great moments of BOOGIE NIGHTS, despite the fact that Walters seems to be playing an amalgam of Amanda Plummer and Fiona Apple. And Philip Seymour Hoffman has a bottomless gentleness as a nurse tending to the fading Robards. And the climactic plague--a ripoff of the earthquake that ends SHORT CUTS, but bettering it--is marvellously directed, though it seems derived from that famous highbrow seventies work, JURASSIC PARK.A creepy feeling sets in about halfway into MAGNOLIA: there's no engine powering the movie forward, and there's only Jon Brien's hammering, Rich Hollywood Movie score faking tension and import. Anderson cuts from one static scene to the next to the next; his editing rhythms have never felt so arbitrary or slack. (The movie feels as if it were picked and picked at in the editing room; lots of storylines are truncated or oddly overprolonged, and loose ends prevail.) The bottom line is that you don't buy anything, and you don't much care about anyone; Anderson stages scenes so inert you can't believe he directed them. (An early one between Reilly and a child rapper knocks the movie cold for about twenty minutes.)And Anderson's power with actors in his first two movies is little in evidence here. Tom Cruise gives one of those jumpy-weirdo performances people always applaud when they're given by a movie-star dreamboat (as when Brad Pitt made googly eyes in TWELVE MONKEYS), but everything he does seems way off. And the director seems so smitten by Julianne Moore's breaking-down-outside-the-courthouse scene in BOOGIE NIGHTS that he's given her a dozen scenes of screaming and weeping. She comes across like an overworked amateur; it's the nadir of her otherwise miraculous career. Even Anderson's favorite actor Philip Baker Hall feels ready to give a great performance, but the thin material robs him of the chance.Paul Thomas Anderson has seemed to me Hollywood movies' last best hope--the guy who might carry the humanist torch of Cassavetes, Scorsese and Altman into the new millennium. He has raised the bar for everyone in a big way. But this movie is a blooper. Anderson's preoccupation with precocious boys is beginning to look a lot like hubris. And if there ever was a movie that proved length isn't everything, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the concept on the IMDb of plot synopsis. I can't possibly imagine how anyone would describe this misguided hotch-potch of a film in terms of 'plot' or indeed any other yardstick by which we measure films. Watch a bit of it, and it seems fine. Quite well acted, a bit quirky, quite provocative. Each scene ends without resolution like a cliffhanger from a TV show. The fact that each scene takes as long as a TV show could test your patience, but surely it hangs together and means something in the end... The film meanders through these 'vignettes'. Is there a non-diminutive version of the word vignette? Vigns? Cos these are BIG vignettes. They go on and on, still well-acted, carefully thought-out and utterly meaningless. The longer the film goes on, the more you realise that nothing is happening, each mini-story too long for a multi-layered film of this kind but too dense to be resolved in the time they are given so that the mixture of frustration and emptiness you are feeling turns to rage. Do you bail? Do you turn off? You have already wasted 2 hours of your life on this, maybe, like many other films, something will happen to make it all worth it, it will be a true art experience...it rains frogs. Is that the end? It rains frogs? Maybe that's it..no, it's still going. I just watched a bit of this film again to challenge myself. Maybe I was in a bad mood. Is it really that bad? Yes. Save yourself. Don't watch this film.</fullReview>

There was not a single character who earned my sympathy, my anger, my happiness, or anything other than my total apathy. The only performance worth the stock it was recorded on was John C.

		<shortDescription>Magnolia Performances - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself is a wonderfully ambitious film. If I were to base an opinion on whether the movie was or was not worth the time it takes to watch it, I would definitely vote yes. However, for all its ambition, the film ultimately fails. The segment where the soundtrack music is played throughout all the scenes does not work. Neither do the urban legends that are put into the film - and yes, they are urban legends - no Green, Berry, Hill; no diver in a tree; no suicide made murder. The performances in Magnolia are its strongest and weakest points. For example, Tom Cruise really is awesome as the misogynistic Frank "T.J." Mackey. John C. Reilly is amazing as the Christian cop and Melora Waters definitely holds her own in the scenes she shares with Reilly. However some of the other actors - actors known for their talent - are performing well beneath par. The scene where Jason Robards goes on about the difficulty of dying is not heart-wrenching at all. All I could think about during the scene was William Shatner as Captain Kirk screaming, "The pain! The pain! The pain!" Many people find Julianne Moore's performance one of Magnolia's saving graces. I beg to differ. Her performance was contrived, calculated, and just way over the top. When she is visiting the lawyer and starts going on about her illicit affairs and says, "i sucked other men's c****," I honestly laughed out loud! The riveting scene in the drugstore too, provides Moore with another opportunity to leap off the over-acting ledge. Her bad performance is surprising to me because I think she is a great actress and the "Magnolia" role is not that different from her "Boogie Nights" role. She played the part of a drug addict in 'Boogie Nights" beautifully and with complete understand of an addict's frame of mind. It appears though, that playing the part of a guilt-ridden, loaded, gold-digger just doesn't work for her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of the most shallow and cynical attempts at making a "great film" I have come across in some time. One can almost see Anderson sitting down with his rented copies of The Shawshank Redemption, It's A Wonderful Life and Short Cuts, studiously taking notes on what a "great film" should be. Instead, the finished product ends up more like Cocoon: The Return, only more manipulative.The film is one that bears all the hallmarks of a bona fide "great film".....various interwoven storylines, lots of talking, lots of "emotional" scenes, lots of crying, some interesting plot turns, and so on. However, bearing the hallmarks of a "great film" does not neccesarily make it one!In my humble opinion, anyone who has watched this film and enjoyed it(which is a lot of you by the looks of things) has fallen victim to an absoloute sucker punch. The whole film reeks of emotional button pushing by numbers.A small footnote: Julianne Moore's performance was one of the most annoying things I have seen in my short time on this earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could very possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. It drags on for three hours with the most entertaining part being the unusual coincidences in the first few minutes.Tom Cruise's part, though an interesting concept, becomes old as the movie progresses. William H. Macy is his usual mediocre self. The other performances are completely unremarkable. Not only are the characters difficult to believe, they do not think like normal people, making it difficult to identify with them.I cannot believe all of the people who enjoyed this film. It had no real identifiable plot, no standout performances, and the most pointless ending in movie history. I gave it a one of ten and would have given it lower if possible. This movie reminds me of the first time I saw Kids. I had heard that it was an interesting movie, but soon learned that it was horribly overrated even though it had a better ending than Magnolia.Remember, watching this movie is three hours of your life that you can never have back. Use this time wisely and rearrange your living room instead of wasting it and your money renting/buying this movie.</fullReview>

I have never written anything but praise for any film on IMDB, but this one was such a stinker I couldn't but speak up in amazement. Amazement because I rented this film on the basis on a good view from Roger Ebert (who normally I agree with) and the fact it was on some best 10 lists for films made in 1999. Why I will NEVER understand. And I liked "Boogie Nights" the directors other film too. I haven't seen a worse film than this one in many, many years.I thought the directing and scriptwriting was dreadful. And part of the bad directing was in the direction of the actors, many of whom turned in their worst performances I have ever seen them do. The characters were uninteresting, vague, hysterical, over-the-top and just unbelievable as real people. It was all just so stagy and false and superficial. And that part with the frogs!!!!!! Oh my.

		<shortDescription>A CHINESE WATER TORTURE OF SHAMELESS PRETENSION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uggghhh! Man, did this movie suck...If someone wanted to torture me to death Clockwork-Orange style all they'd have to do is force me to watch this embarrassment back-to-back with Kubrick's humiliating final stinker 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I would beg them to put a bullet through my cranium.Talk about cynical...this flick makes Todd Solondz's movies look like romantic dreamscapes (no offense to Solondz whose movies are all fabulous). There was a little old lady a few rows in front of me and I really felt embarrassed for her, something that never happens to me unless a movie is extremely distasteful and just plain WRONG on every front.What could she be thinking, I wondered (that's how bored I was with the film)? I imagined the scenario in my head: From the magnificent male movie stars of her era-- Gable, Bogart, Cagney, Tracy, etc.-- she has come to tolerate, after the '70s revolution in popular cinema, certain hardcore performances of the ilk branded by DeNiro and Keitel (in the name of uncensored art, of course); but to witness the embarrassing spectacle of a bimbo like Cruise trying to ape them so distastefully and in such mercenary fashion (fully aware of the fact that he will be praised by 'critics' for his 'daring')? It must've sent her dreaming of the good old days of John Garfield and Brando, when men were men and certain things stayed private and out of the movies (although, they did see print, if the crucial 'allowable level of profanity' had been found, as in Norman Mailer's books). Censorship may have stifled a few cinematic geniuses but it sure kept the pretentious mediocrities from polluting wholesome Americans with cynical nonsense.And now that Americans are so much 'freer,' censorship of taste and a certain amount of 'snobbism' must be in full effect to offset the damage done by movies like 'Magnolia' and 'Eyes Wide Shut.' 'Correct expression' is and has always been the issue that artists have had to deal with. It is they who claim to have insight into matters of 'expression.' The greatest artists raise the level and range of 'correct expression' and literally force the public to see things their way. Sooner or later the public will have to give in and always does, if history is any indication.In the cinema and in relation to 'Magnolia,' Scorsese and Altman come to mind. They have found the proper modes of cinematic expression for the seamier aspects of life and have integrated that with many other factors. P.T. shows no respect for the crucial balance they've attained by pretending he can do it better any which way he feels like it. He thinks of himself a new pioneer in these matters when he's not even old hat. I suggest he sticks to what he can handle, overrated little 'risque' entertainments like 'Boogie Nights,' and aspire to DePalma territory instead (he'll be lucky if he can ever make a film half as great as 'Blow-Out').Altman, whose 'Short-Cuts' is the obvious model here, uses profanity and a certain amount of lewdness as cynical little details of a broad canvas that goes much deeper. The same details in 'Magnolia' become the whole painting. In fact, the profanity and is so gratuitous and the cynicism so uninteresting it makes David Mamet look like an optimist.As to the acting: I can understand an airhead Scientologist like Tom Cruise agreeing to play a character that could never exist openly in real life (even Hustler magazine never takes misogyny that far since it would completely destroy its credibility as to whatever genuine liberating effects it has had in its own sleazy way), but there is no excuse for a great actor like Jason Robards (did he need the part that bad?) or an Altman veteran like Julian Moore, to play one-sided, cynical cartoons that DO NOT EXIST IN REAL LIFE even among the most depressed of the prozaced population. These characters are certain characteristics of actual persons pretending to be whole persons. That never cuts it; and experienced actors, of all people, should be the ones to know it. Did Moore and Robards bother to read the atrocious, curse-for-no-reason-even-David Mamet-could-think-of dialogue? What justified their faith in this guy to put themselves out ('emotionally naked,' is that the term for using too many idiotic curses per sentence and putting the magnifying glass only on wretchedness?) as they do here? I suggest they be more careful next time to prevent embarrassment to themselves and the dignity of art in general.One final thing before I leave you all to your own questionable judgments. If you want to see how terrible a film can be and also how great a film it's trying to imitate looks by contrast, take one scene as an example: SPOILER ALERT It's when P.T. Anderson tries to rip-off (they call it homage nowadays) the dialogue in the scene from 'Raging Bull' given to Cathy Moriarity, when Jake (DeNiro) is beating her (his wife) because, in his paranoid jealousy, he suspects her of sleeping with his brother Joey (Joe Pesci). Moriarty, to get back at Jake, admits to having performed oral sex on his brother and 'everyone else on the F'n' block.' DeNiro is much more shocked and offended by the revelation of this graphic detail than the graphic admission of the adultery itself. In 'Magnolia,' when Julian Moore sits in her psychiatrist's office and suddenly, completely out of the blue, admits to having performed not only sex but specifically 'oral' sex on many men other than her old dying husband (Robards) while they were married, it is so gratuitous, it makes you cringe in your seat. Why are we being given this specific information, P.T.? Does the graphic information make the adultery look any worse or more degrading or more funny? Do we really care that this woman is so cut-off that she desperately wants to feel guilty but can't even manage that, by evoking pictures of the graphic X-rated details of the life of an adultress? Do we care that she's on the verge of suicide? Hell no! P.T. might be aiming at all that and his aspirations can be commended and pretensions lamented but the result is flat and unaffective. The scene only makes Julian Moore look foolish for having agreed to speak pornographic dialogue when the guilt she feels in having betrayed her dying husband is in no way made believable by previous events! Is P.T. trying to break new ground by doing this? Is this some new existentialist angle revealing the emptiness of modern life? Hell no! He is copying and trying to do what Scorcese did and failing embarrassingly. No extensive character development has prepared us for the graphic confession (though we were certainly expecting more profanity, since every other word in the dialogue is a curse) and we couldn't care less for it.Why is the same type of 'slice of life with all the graphic details' so overwhelmingly effective and tragically funny in 'Raging Bull' and so awfully uninteresting in 'Magnolia?' The answer to that, my cyber-friends, is a long and deeply important one (it has to do with logical progression and fully developed REAL characters to start with), and it is what separates the great directors from the mediocre and establishes the criterion for what is truly valuable art and checks the damage inflicted by all that would be mistaken for it.</fullReview>

It's the emptiest of empty vessels: No idea, no vision, no reason to exist. More a grad school thesis project than visionary work, it's a severe stumble in P.T. Anderson's heretofore promising career. Maybe that's why the former Paul Thomas Anderson has reverted to his initials: He, too, knows there's a sucker born every minute. Why else would he inflict such a disappointing sham as Magnolia on movie lovers? Better directors have said more in the opening credits than this movie manages to croak in its 3 1/2 hours.I give it a rating of 1, with the caveat that the Aimee Mann soundtrack is lovely.</fullReview>

After an hour, I had enjoyed only about 10 minutes of the movie and I'm not that hard to please. I was feeling desperate for Prozac or anything that would stop the pain.

		<fullReview>I don't really see the point in submitting a review if all you are going to do is rubbish the movie concerned, but in the case of this particular one I feel an exception has to be made. Why? Because I was strung along by this movie for 3 hours plus in the hope that something may be resolved or indeed something may actually happen. And it didn't. Don't get me wrong, I do not need a film to be linear or all neat and tidy for me to enjoy it, from this database I appear to be one of the few to enjoy "The Ninth Gate", a confusing mess with an similarly abrupt ending. Some people tend to get all snobby about movies, in a "Oh if you didn't like or understand this go and watch Gone in 60 seconds instead" kind of way. Just because a film is touted as a little more cerebral, is 3 hours long, and contains significant analysis of people and relationships it must be art. Is it?There appear to be two camps created by Magnolia, both share the similarity in that they are vocal and strong in their standpoint. They also are equally convinced of their take on how the film should be perceived. It is a good thing if a film does evoke strong reactions, and Magnolia certainly generates extreme opinions from both sides of the coin. Personally, I honestly cannot see, even by reading many others interpretations and by seeing the film all in one go, how this film can be perceived as a classic in any way. This film is pretentious, boring, preachy, maudlin, and eventually vacuous. Some of the acting is indeed quite good but the characters are odious and superficial. The script appears to have been written by an arty Sixth Former who one day decided to write an angst ridden story that would show the whole world where we are going wrong. Surely a film has to have decent characters and a good script before it is going anywhere, this movie has neither, (apart from Tom Cruise's Frank Mackey, who is very amusing in the first hour).Much has been made of the films interlude where the cast are all individually shown singing "Wise Up". I couldn't believe this scene was actually happening, some will find it moving, others will find it utterly laughable. This film annoyed me, I stuck with it as some parts showed promise and it continually makes you feel something is around the corner, but frustratingly it ends up unfulfilled. A poor attempt in my view, but don't take my word for it, if its number #124 on the IMDB chart someone must like it!</fullReview>

These people haven't sat through all three hours of this horrible excuse for a movie. I don't know how Paul Thomas Anderson got all these well-known actors to do this piece-of-garbage. I guess this movie is an example of what people will do for money. The story lines are supposed to merge because Paul's narrator tells us so. Well, they never do. And when it rains, the movie becomes totally unintelligible. It just gets worse and worse with no meaning. The story makes no sense and makes no attempt to converge which is implied by the start. Even the good characters, William Macy and the cop, can't redeem this feature. It is lacks any story to allow these characters to shine. Instead, it relies on a mish-mash of overdoses, crisises and a death to prove that these story lines are somehow linked. What really disturbed me is how many times the word f#%k could pass as a piece of dialog. They even had the little rapper kid doing it. And that is what amazed me the most, there is no actual communication. There are just random bits of discussion laced with huge amounts of profanity. I hope this isn't a sign of movies to come. I used to think the Paul Thomas Anderson couldn't out do the mediocrity of Boogie Nights. I was wrong. This movie is in contention for the worst high-budget movie ever and is PTA's worst. Don't rent it or buy it. You will regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First few minutes were great . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After that, it turned into a load of crap. I was really excited when I saw the first few minutes, with all of the talk about coincidences, it was hilarious! Unfortunately, as the movie progressed, the only 2 characters I cared about were the cop and the druggie, and the kid wiz a little. I finally had to fast forward through most of it, just so I could enjoy what little there was to enjoy. I'm usually into weird, screwed up movies, but what was up with the frogs? And after the rain of frogs, everyone just went on about their business like nothing had happened. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't put up with the crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretentious, tedious and in some places offensive. However, more offensive than any of the content is the fact that it is so boring and so long. The acting in places is pretty good and Tom Cruise excels as a complete ass, but there is just no good reason to spend 3 hours of your life watching this. There are films about real people and real emotions and those which intend just to entertain (and in rare instances those which do both - La Vita e Bella), and I'd argue that this contains none of those attributes! An unreal bunch of sad, anxious, depressed, self-centred people that I have no empathy for at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film of of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few weeks ago and until now have been too traumatized to even comment on it. This movie was the worst one that I've seen in a long long time. First off there was absolutely no plot. Now I don't mind a movie with a loose plot but this was ridiculous. Second was the script, I found that by the end of a long tortuous three hours I couldn't care less if the characters lived, died or didn't even bother finishing the movie. The acting was alright but with the script the cast had to work with they even came off poorly in my opinion. In summary, I feel robbed of the three hours this movie took off my life. I don't ever plan on watching it again...heck I'll even avert my eyes when I go by it in the local video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the effort is on one side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretentious moviegoers bill Magnolia a "thinking person's film." There is some truth to that. However, the mere fact of expending effort does not guarantee the reward will be worth the force required, and this film is a textbook example.Are there multiple layers to this film? Clearly. Do the parallels make sense? They do. Do they have religious and philosophical connotations? You bet. Is there any point? Perhaps. Paul Thomas Anderson has obviously read his Bible and his literature handbook.Alas, an educated man does not a good storyteller make, for while it takes a semi-literate viewer to comprehend the subtexts of this bizarre ?uvre, it takes rather little genius to stack a deck of philosophical statements and literary devices without weaving them into a well-written script with an actual plot and sympathetic characters.The police officer is the one exception. He was the one character I actually cared to know about. The rest are whiny, vulgar and disingenuous--in a word, pathetic, and they scarcely rise above that at any point. So the story was about emotions, not about growth. The fact is, they didn't show enough humanity for us to care about their emotions.The script is just as bad. Anderson's inability to constrain profanity to the most feral emotive outbursts, written or spoken, smacks of verbal immaturity. I cannot comment on the plot for the simple reason that there is none, except to say that the late sequence intended to stand in for a climax, while perhaps meaningful as subtext, simply does not fit in any way on a literal level.As an acquaintance said of a similarly bad exercise in storytelling, "What a cop-out." Nice try, Anderson, but when the elementary structure is missing, the volume and weight of a composition have no effect on its quality. Back to creative writing 101.</fullReview>

I did not care for any of these people. I was hoping at the end they were on the Titanic. If you love 3 hour films then watch the equally pointless "The Thin Red Line" and the boring "Meet Joe Black" the never ending "Heaven's Gate" and the over produced epic remake of 2005 version of "King Kong". I wish I could get the nightmare of this film out of my mind! Again this was the nail on the coffin of going to the movies and watching 3 hour movies.

		<shortDescription>The three Ds- dark, daring and dazzling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Magnolia' is perhaps the most polarising of Paul Thomas Anderson's work. A lot of people have found it thought-provoking, emotionally impacting and dazzling in many ways, while many others have found it dull, self-indulgent, bloated and overlong.This reviewer falls into the former camp. 'Magnolia' perhaps feels indulgently overlong in places, and the final group musical number does feel contrived and out of sorts with the rest of the film. On the whole though 'Magnolia' is a dark, daring and dazzling film, and another winner in a filmography where this reviewer has yet to watch a dud.All of Anderson's films are visually stunning, and 'Magnolia' has some of the most haunting and scintillating arresting images of any of his films, especially at the end. The long takes and tracking shots are distinctively Anderson and look wonderful, the whole film is beautifully shot, very atmospherically lit and the production design is suitably audacious. The soundtrack is rich in emotion and sticks in the head, and all the song choices are well chosen. Some found it intrusive, not to me.Regarding the script, it contains some of the most thought-provoking, layered and poignant writing of all Anderson's films. The story has a long length to work with, and doesn't disappoint with the pacing which is a mix of suitably manic and suitably languid when either extreme is needed, unpredictable, beautifully developed, hugely entertaining, dark and often very emotional scenarios and richly layered characters, remarkable for so much going on. Anderson's direction is also exemplary.Another controversial asset of 'Magnolia' is the ending, something that many will find powerful (again fall into this camp) and others will be perplexed. Whatever extreme you find yourselves, it certainly is not an ending that one forgets easily. Anderson's mastery of direction of actors and their interactions shows through loud and clear, with the whole cast giving superb performances in one-of-a-kind roles, for some among their best.Tom Cruise in particular has an absolute ball, and he is particularly well supported by a gleefully entertaining and charming John C. Reilly, a touchingly restrained William H. Macy, an as always exemplary Philip Seymour Hoffmann and a heartfelt Julianne Moore. Jason Robards and Melora Walters also do brilliantly.In conclusion, dark, daring and dazzling. The most polarising of Anderson's films but incredibly well executed, a flawed masterpiece somewhat. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Spoilers: Great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to site that I watched this film with no expectations. I stumbled across it on IMDb and added it to my watch list. I wasn't put off by the 3 hr duration because as with any good film I was engaged throughout and the 3hrs felt like very little time at all. The lack of clear linear narrative did not put me off in-fact it made this film even more unique because it became unpredictable and that is what made it so engaging. I wasn't watching a typical Hollywood feel good movie i was watching an artistic exploration of hard-cutting themes like regret, choice, fear and confrontation. Anderson does an incredible job in intertwining these stories in a very subtle manner that doesn't make it seem too unbelievable. And it really does make you think that coincidence is unknowingly a huge part of life. This film got me thinking that everyone has a story, you glance in every car or shop window and behind it is a human, with a story, with a struggle. Not centering the action around one character was key to this. I don't want to give much away because i feel this is a film that you have to watch without too much to know. It will boggle your mind at times but in an engaging manner. If your an action fan and can't stomach a film that requires the audience's interpretation to fulfill the ambiguity the film creates then i wouldn't bother watching this as you would have been one of the many walkers who left the cinema when this film first came out. That's fine, when you have a film that stands on it's own and is special because it doesn't confer with typical story telling rules, not every spectator will be satisfied. Performances: For me there were solid performances all around. Tom Cruise was very convincing at times but i still saw some similar personal quirks and traits that shone through during high intense moments. Julianne Moore was a bit over the top for me at times and didn't stand out as much as Phillip Seymour Hoffman who although had one of the smaller and perhaps minimal parts created a lot of detail and was extremely effective during moments of raw emotion, it all stems from his subtlety he never smothers the audience but rather draws them in to the point of empathy. John C. Reilly really surprised me in this film i didn't think much of him prior to watching this because although i have never seen him play a role that is far away from himself and still haven't it didn't matter in this film. He was very engaging during all his scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie with few flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intriguing and entertaining study in characters going through varying levels of crisis and introspection. This psychological drama leads you in several different directions, weaving and intersecting various subplots and characters, from a brilliant Tom Cruise, as a self- proclaimed pied-piper, to a child forced to go on a TV game show and the pressures he faces from a ruthless father.Starring, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly , Melora Walters , Jeremy Blackman , Michael Bowen , William H. Macy , Philip Baker Hall , Melinda Dillon , Emmanuel Johnson , Lillian Adams , Henry Gibson , Felicity Huffman , Ricky Jay , Alfred Molina , Luis Guzman.Directed by one of my top favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson. his movies like There Will Be Blood and Boogie Nights are one of the best movies ever.Nominated for 3 Oscars, Best Supporting actor Tom Cruise, Original Song and Original Screenplay. it was a winner of many awards but mostly for acting ensembles and a hit at festivals winning Golden Berlin Bear.one of the most weirdest film making ever. this is a psychological drama movie which is a big mosaic of nterrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and some meaning of their current or past life in California. this movie is literally not quite explainable. it is a deep, sad, depressing and quite complex movie with many stories of many people. i have seen quite these type of movies recently but this is way different than others.running time of this movie bothered me a lot. and the other thing is that even though with many characters and incidents happening to them, many unanswered questions are left. character development was a bit weak for some. P.T Anderson as i said did a fantastic job with this movie. Screenplay was the best thing about the movie. edited okay, not very good. good cinematography and score with a lovely song Save me. good overall.it required 30 minutes for me to actually understand and feel the movie or what was going on. it is slow and may bore some people, if editing was done a bit better and the running time was reduced while the plot could have been more compact, this movie would have been a very good movie. but, still it is a good experience.Tom Cruise clearly gave the best performance of his career as a supporting actor here. this uptight speaker kind of role with his emotional past just superbly done. he is the best performer and the best actor or character to look for here. Julianne Moore though seems good but she is an overrated actress according to me. still she does great talking while crying scenes ever. John C. Reily and Philip Seymour Hoffman were nice too. William H. Macy was my favorite performer after Tom. overall this great ensemble performances and the variety of shades in their characters with their own distinct interesting stories and objectives makes this movie a wonderful experience.some scenes like the beginning of this movie hinted me that it is gonna rock, though it was slightly disappointed afterwards. it shows some incidents narrated by some actor about how strange things happen everyday in the world. some parts of the movie is illogical but that is never a bad thing if not shown well. OMG! and the ending!!!! the most weirdest and shocking endings i have ever seen in my life, SPOILER* you see raining frogs, though a water sprout or something does that in real life but here it was without rain or water. i read it was a Biblical reference but no idea why actually it was used. * SPOILER ENDthis movie has a poetic premise to it, it is the most imperfect of the perfect movies of 1999. many developments in the movie are so surprising. many things happens that are connected to something else. like i said, strange things always happens. give to watch, IF YOU CAN.</fullReview>

A layered and emotionally wrenching story told in visually arresting fashion with believable characters and pitch-perfect performances. Standouts: Cruise, as a worldly Don Juan, Moore, as a promiscuous and grief-stricken wife.

Anyone could have played Frank T.J. Mackey and been as convincingly.The "unusual" rain was a little preposterous. I was way too long. If it was trimmed to 2:15, I'd have enjoyed it more.

		<shortDescription>Spliced Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, I spent most of this movie worrying that all the storylines would be united in a single car crash, or somehow having them all end up in the same building. I was pleased that their connection was more sublimated. The characters seemed to fill roles in each other's lives, whether they physically met or not.I do wonder whether the frogs were necessary, I guess it was nice having one common thread through all the stories, but......i don't know, it seemed like more of a cheep shocker than a legitimate addition to the story. Same goes for the bookend sequences, as much as loved them, I think there was enough meat in the story without them.Last year I watched "Time Code" on IFC, which is basically a failed attempt at a similar structure only with video. Sometimes a clever idea can take over a film, and carry it while the film suffers from other factors. Another example would be "Run Lola Run". Magnolia is the perfection of what one might call "spliced drama", for it still manages to be "about" the characters, and not how they are related.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, let's start with this. I've just finnished watching this movie and right now im still thinking about weither i should hate it or love it. Maybe that was what PT Anderson was aiming for, really i don't know.The reason i like this movie is that it's truly original. It's overall realistic and you really get to know the characters more than in any other movie i've ever seen. The directing is superb and this movie will certainly tuch you in some way, weither you like it or not. I'm living proof of that. But i must confess that i will never see this movie again, at many times i was boored and almost sleepy. It felt like the story never went anywhere. It was just going on and on for 3 hours with loads of boring dialogue. I'm not sure why i finnished the whole thing but my guess is that this talanted young director was so professional when introducing the characters and with the amazing coinsedences in the beginning that i just felt i had to sit it out. I'm just gonna end this rewiew by telling you all that i'm not sure if this movie has gotten a to high score on this site. Right now i feel like voting twice and first give it a 1 for being boring and slow. And i also feel like giving it a 10 since it really moved me and it will certainly stay in my head for quite some time.5/10 (Felt that would be most accurate vote since i kinda feel more and more that i hated it.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which is *really* all you can say about this. Magnolia is a study, as opposed to a tale, of loneliness and hopelessness. Despair is key here, with every character is an unenviable position of sheer futility. The idea behind the movie is chance. In my opinion it isn't explored as much as you would expect, or hope, but aspects certainly come to the fore. It is really difficult to sum the movie up, so I won't try, but I will say the performances from every actor are top-notch, without exception. I can't even say 'especially' as I felt each actor did as well as their peers, and I feel it would be unfair to single any out.I would recommend this movie, but remember it isn't a standard tale with beginning, middle and end.Frankly, the acting is more important than the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting - But the frogs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished this movie after seeing it a while ago in the theaters. I must admit that the cast throughout, even small specks of a role are very human and very believable, truly some of the finest collectively you'll find. The Frogs?Plot: One full day in L.A. Parents, children, lovers and nobody's come one step closer to understanding the principles and complications of love and forgiveness. Then Frogs happen.With one to five minute clips of each story passing through the day you don't get as bored as you think you might. What really will draw you in (if you are of the %50 who liked this movie) is the acting. Tom cruise is his typical cocky self, and we watch that character slowly breakdown to the persona of a little boy. To the contrary William H Macy is his normal wimp character who slowly gains confidence (a little at least). Jason Robards fits nicely in to the last breaths of a dying man role. Phillip Baker Hall, is quite frightening portraying the duality of appearance for game show hosts on and off camera. Julianne Moore gives us the full circle of guilt and how it eats at us. Philip Seymour Hoffman is still in his stereo-cast yet he has a hero-esque presence through the film. The true academy award, however, should go to John C. Reily. His role as your nice-guy LAPD officer is too funny to be fake, he had me the most engrossed with his cop mannerism, so text-book and clean cut. Even the supporting roles are executed as if they were at the same level.Bottom line: Directing of course great with Paul Thomas Andersons' famous loud impacts to wake up the audience. The soundtrack cradles the mood too well. But mainly, the merit of the acting is far superior to most movies and deserves at least a once over by every movie connoisseur. Just make sure you don't ave a fear of frogs... or you'll be scared to death.</fullReview>

It's a great idea to tell several stories at the same time, but the problem here is that it does not even have one interesting story line. The result is a giant collage of boring subplots, which do not even come together well at the end. I myself don't find anything interesting about celebrities cheating on their spouses or spouses cheating on them and incest has lost its shock value eons ago. Hasn't anybody seen a Jerry Springer show before? Let's not confuse junk with art. Junk is simply junk. If there is one bright spot in the movie, it's Aimee Mann's music. It suits the theme well.A colossal waste of time. Would have been 6/10 had it been shorter, but at 188 minutes, it's 100 minutes too long and it's only worth 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strong performances, moody camerawork, and some interesting points on the meaning of life, ambition and forgiveness almost contrive to make a superb movie, but they can't make up for a lack of credibility in some of the tales and a loss of direction towards the end of the piece.The film starts well with plenty of energy and intriguing cuts and you soon realise that you're in for a character piece which isn't necessarily going to have a conclusive, tidy ending. Not necessarily a problem. There are a number of story-lines all connected by a game-show and you do find yourself intrigued to know how the day is going to pan out for each of these characters. And like a good game-show you stay put to find out the result.We hear about the game-show's producer - dying of cancer in the care of a male nurse; the game-show's host - dying of cancer as he performs (cancer seems to be a recurring theme); the game-show's current star player - a child prodigy; and a former child star player but failure in life. Added to this mix are the tales of the producer's son - a misogynistic self-improvement guru; a caring cop in search of love; the producer's mixed up mistress; and the host's mixed up daughter (being mixed up is another recurring theme). All excellently played.At about the halfway point you begin to draw parallel's with Robert Altman's Short Cuts...and it's at about the same stage that the film seems to lose its way. Magnolia suffers by comparison with Short Cuts. It lacks its predecessor's humour, the relationships between the story-lines are somehow less satisfying, and with the exception of the young quiz contestant Stanley, and possibly the policeman, you have very little sympathy for any of the characters. They were too emotional and into their own problems for me to develop anything but indifference to their plights. But where I think it suffers most is that I believed Short Cuts and I didn't believe Magnolia. It stretches synchronicity to the limits of its elasticity, and when all the cast began independently singing the same song, credibility snapped! By the time the shower of frogs came I'd written this one off as an actors' fantasy workout, and I felt slightly cheated by what had started out with such promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing this movie twice in one day (as there is no way whatsoever that one can view this movie once and draw a valid, credible conclusion about it), I can honestly say that this is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. After seeing it the first time, I said to my friend who viewed it with me, "Umm..." After viewing it the second time with a team of first time viewers (which gave me the opportunity of feeding off their array of perspectives they were voicing throughout the movie) I was able to make a lot more sense out of it.I'd like to say that this movie had possibly the most intriguing introduction to a movie that I've ever seen. And as to the ending, I've GOT to watch the movie again so I can make some kind of sense out of that.As much as I can tell, Earl Partridge (played by Jason Robards) is the central character of the movie. I LOVE how delightfully inadvertently he is responsible for all the goings-on of the movie. He is connected to Cruise and Moore because they are his wife and son. He's connected to the game show host because he personally is the game show producer, he's connected to William H. Macy and Jeremy Blackman because they are both scarred products of the show, and in a very inadvertent way, he is connected to the cop...the "savior" of his game show host's coke-addict daughter. Yes, that was really pushing it, but between the soliloquies of both Robards and John C. Reilly (the cop) toward the end, the movie becomes not only credible, but profound.In short, Magnolia is a wild masterpiece that, in my mind, demands multiple viewings and an honest reckoning (if you can stomach Tom Cruise's great adaptation of the deranged, obsessive sex psychologist)! The movie has a tendency to drag, but I think that it only does this if you can't appreciate the depth of the characters in each scene and if you don't do things like try to figure out why in the heck frogs fell from the sky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But if you like a film about convergence, redemption, resolution and love of humanity; THEN You might like this.Tom Cruise is hard to take at first, but you will see by the end of the film that he is brilliant in this role. William H Macy is also very good, but then we've grown to expect him to be excellent as the off-kilter desperate 2nd focus as he was in Fargo.Again, this is NOT a "Movie", this is film-art and a great example of what can ONLY be accomplished in cinema.And, by the way, there is a good reason for it to rain frogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson paid great attention to detail in this visually superb film. The cast is very well selected, cinematography is outstanding and the writing, unique. The film is not original in the sense of telling several different stories, (though P.T.A. is very particular that this is one entire story, and it is) or shall I say, events, because several films have already done this. But P.T.A. does succeed in giving this brand of film making a new, fresh and quite appealing aspect to it. The events, though seemingly unrelated in the beginning, all come together at the end in a very strange way. There are several moments in the film that had a personal impact on myself, and I think that is the great thing about this movie: no matter how unrelated you are with these characters, you can still find something that draws a relationship between yourself and them. The bottom line is that it's movies like these that are going to and have already changed the art form of film. So see it, though I can't quite judge this work it is something that is truly unique and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of the reviews (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take issue with many of the poor reviews for this movie. If you are reading them to determine whether or not to see the movie, don't. But I feel that most people read these reviews to validate their own feelings about a movie they have seen.Somehow, I escaped most of the hype for this movie and knew very little about it before I rented it (I do this semi-consciously so that my enjoyment of my first viewing is not spoiled). Those reviewers that have said that the introductory stories have nothing to do with the picture, the frogs came out of nowhere, the characters' actions were without cause, and on and on and on, clearly did not "get" this movie. I did. In retrospect, I think the theme of the movie is "too little, too late." All of the characters experience a loss, of which most could have been prevented if they had the courage to face their fears and short-comings in time for others to care. Believe it or not, I would have liked Magnolia to have been a little longer. I did not have a full understanding of how the Tom Cruise character became an Andrew Dice Clay style preacher, or why the drug-abusing wife was so self-turmoiled.I think what I liked most, as I have liked in many other movies of the recent past, is the complete abandon that many "mainstream" movies are willing to proceed with. This was almost non-existent in the 80's, a little light peeked through in the early 90's, and we are seeing more of in the past few years. The era we are currently seeing reminds me of 70's movies with promising directors, a blend of experienced acting talent with fresh, young talent, and a boldness of material. I even see it in movies that I don't like (Fight Club). Magnolia would have never seen a reel of film in the 80's. Neither would Fargo, Pulp fiction, The Thin Red Line, Run Lola Run, or American Beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually when critics praise an independent film I end up not liking the film, this movie would be an exception to the rule. What makes Magnolia great would have to be the direction of the film by P.T. Anderson, that alone would be enough to make this movie great but the fact that so many talented actors and actresses signed on to work in this film pushes it over the top. I don't enjoy long movies anything over 2 and a half hours usually annoys me, but this movie is edited so well together with so many stories. The best performance was probably by Tom Cruise as Frank Mackey and John C. Reilly as a good natured cop. At the beginning of the film Reilly is shown to be all good and Cruise is made out to be all bad and throughout the course of this movie you begin to understand where they both are coming from and what they both strive for. The characters in this film are all realistically depicted they are all real people, which means that you see them in their entirety so that there are no villains or heroes just people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I did really like Magnolia, but I felt that it was a big ALMOST. The acting is incredible. Each cast member delivers a fantastic performance that endears you toward their character and their plight. The weaving of the sub-plots are extremely well edited and strung together. When it is engaging, it is very well written.Unfortunately parts of the film feel too long, and some scenes could have been cut in half. And there was the feeling of wanting to see more of Stanley or Mackey, but we got lumped with an endless Partridge monologue, or a tedious bar scene with Donnie Smith. Sometimes the direction was wonderfully clever and quick-moving, and at others boring and slow, for no real reason.The frogs was a unique touch that was unnecessary, and I felt was put into the film out of whimsey. Yes, yes, yes, Exodus 8:2, a plague of frogs in Egypt, but how does that correlate with the plot of the movie? It ultimately affects two of the characters, but it just being 'one of those things' doesn't wash.The overriding triumph of this film is the humanity, and what people deal with while living their lives. It is well worth seeing, bearing in mind that you are really seeing one day in the lives of ordinary (and not-so ordinary) people. PS: In the DVD documentary, Paul Anderson does not talk about Magnolia as being one of top five best screenplays ever. He's talking about the film Network (1976) when viewing it to his team to show what he's looking for in the portrayal of Jimmy Gator. And he talks about what other people think of Boogie Nights, and how Magnolia will (and did) get compared to it.PPS: It is not the most overlooked film of 1999. Fight Club was. At least Magnolia got some awards and critical acclaim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'This is a definitely not something that I expected' were my first thoughts after I went out of the movie theatre yesterday, seeing 'Magnolia' for the first time. Indeed, how can you expect something like this - it just can't be describred. In fact, I was speechless after a movie probably for the first time in my life, although there are other films that have moved me over the years. However, I was simply appaled before this display of cinema art that Paul Thomas Anderson has presented us with.I admit that I haven't seen the critically acclaimed 'Boogie Nights', but now I'm sure that P.T. Anderson is one of the people, because of whom cinema deserves to be placed among the other six arts. The whole idea of the movie was beyond anyone's perception - vision (extraordinary cinematography), charachters, music (here I give much to the choice of Aimee Mann to write most of the soundtrack) and of course the story, although it simply cannot be described in a few words. The cast is also magnificent - I did have some doubts about Tom Cruise, especially after the reviews that this was the best part in his career, but I must say that he convinced me that he can play not worse than the remaining great actors. I could give you just a short list - William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymor Hoffman, Jason Robards and many others, as each one of them contributes to the perfectness of the film.Now I know that this review comes a little bit late - unfortunately we see lots of good movies quite a while, if ever, after the official premiere, but to everyone who hasn't seen 'Magnolia' and yearns for something different from everything else you have seen before - this is the place to go. If you don't feel that way - well, there are always the Farelli brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme.</fullReview>

Jason Robards gives a fine performance as well. However, most of the characters in the film are not likeable people and the film is pretty dark. Although I really like Julianne Moore, I found her character to be absolutely irritating. So irritating that I had to turn down the volume when she came on the screen. The performances are moving, though. I felt there should have been a little more closure at the end, but I guess Paul Anderson did that intentionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melora Walters and John C. Reilly outweigh the film's flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say that despite the film's flaws, Paul Thomas Anderson continues to prove he is one of the great modern filmmakers with "Magnolia." At best, it displays a poetic quality. The way story lines intertwine emotionally, often times without blending in the actual plot of the movie, creates a desperate, lonely tone. Even though the film doesn't find Anderson at his most focused, his total disregard of typical cookie-cutter Hollywood storytelling is refreshing.With that said, I find some serious flaws with the film. I've heard Anderson saying he relished the chance to create a film around the songs of Aimee Mann. She does indeed add some good music to the soundtrack, but the way it's edited into the film in several scenes is quite annoying. In one of the opening scenes we are introduced to all the main characters as Mann sings "One is the loneliest number." This would work fine, but the song is quite sparse and simple, and the arrangement is quite long. I know this was necessary, since there was quite a bit of story to set up, but by the end of the sequence, I wanted to scream, "turn off that #@%&amp;* song!," especially since it was featured fairly loud in the audio mix. In another scene, Mann's song "Wise Up" is played as we see the characters in their various situations singing along. The lyrics lent themselves to what was happening at that point in the movie, and I don't have a problem with the premise, but for the time being it spoiled my suspension of disbelief. Jason Robards was very ill. Why didn't Anderson leave the singing in that part to Philip Seymore Hoffman, or at least have had Robards mutter the words in a manner believable for someone in his physical condition. I'm sure Anderson intended this musical sequence to have more of an art house quality than the rest of the picture. Still, I've seen sequences where actors have broken into song where, although definitely still the stuff of movies, they worked more effectively (off the top of my head, "Almost Famous" comes to mind). My biggest complaint with the music comes at the end of the picture. In an emotional scene between Melora Walters and John C. Reilly, Thomas has another Mann song so high in the mix you can't hear what Reilly is saying. I'm sure Thomas wanted to us to see how the lyrics related to the moment, but the song would have worked much more effectively in the background. I find myself straining to hear the dialogue when I watch the scene. I want to stress that I don't have a problem with Mann's music, I just think Thomas went overboard with including it in the film. Instead of enhancing Magnolia, it detracted from it.Another complaint I have is that Anderson seemed to force a theme upon the film, when the film already had an unsaid theme of it's own. I'm talking about adding the whole thing about how sometimes the seemingly unimaginable, the stuff of movies, happens to everyday people. I don't see how the scenes that bookend the movie, the stuff about the suicide, the diver and the robbers adds to the movie. And I don't see how the thing with the frogs adds to it, either. They don't drastically detract from it, but Anderson definitely lost focus. The rest of the movie had a theme of its own- This is a lonely world. It can be difficult letting go of the past when it won't let go of us.Although Thomas' use of ensemble casts and multiple storylines are his forte, in this case, he went a little far. In "Boogie Nights" we had Eddie/Dirk Diggler holding the whole thing together. With Magnolia, their is no central character, and the movie drags as a result. Although all of the actors gave great performances, some dead weight could have been cut from the script. Julianne Moore was great in some emotional scenes, but her character in particular seems to have been unnecessary to the movie. The role should have been cut or broadened. It doesn't add much emotionally to the film. When I go back and watch the movie, I find myself fast-forwarding through her scenes. I just don't have any emotional attachment to what's going on. Same with some of the scenes with Robards and Hoffman- great actors, but upon a second viewing some of this stuff just drags. After seeing Hoffman's great performance in "Boogie Nights," his talent almost seems wasted.The Fast-Forward-stoppers, the scenes that I find myself popping this movie in for, are the ones featuring Melora Walters (Claudia Wilson Gator), and John C. Reilly (Jim Kurring). The scenes with these characters have a focus the rest of the movie lacks. I loved John C. Reilly in "Boogie Nights," but I love this character even more. As he attempts to flirt with Claudia, he displays a charming nervousness that goes beyond the script. I can imagine the heartache and loneliness that his character has experienced without the script having to lay it all out for me. Melora Walters came as a surprise. It seems that the performances of Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore have been heralded, but the emotional bulk of their performances don't seem to match-up to the performances of Walters and Reilly (although Cruise did great work, especially in the bedside scene with Robards). The less-famous and consequently less-heralded Walters really knocked one out of the ball park. In a manner that went far-beyond the script, I could believe this lady couldn't function without constant lines of cocaine; I could believe that the past wouldn't leave her alone.This is a good movie that could have been a great one. Anderson could have cut some of the unnecessary characters or scenes. He could have chosen a character or two to feature more prominently as he did with Dirk Diggler in "Boogie Nights." After seeing the great performances of Reilly and Walters, I wish they would have been the ones to get the star treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" looks and feels a lot like the movies "Grand Canyon" with Danny Glover and Kevin Kline and "Falling Down" with Michael Douglas as the laid-off engineer who flips out and goes on a rampage. All three of these movies are set in Los Angeles."Magnolia" is a good movie, however I do have a few arguments about it. Whether the writer/director intended to or not, he portrays Anglo-Americans in his movie as being the only Americans who have serious morality issues to resolve. The life experience of Black-Americans living in Los Angeles in this movie is clearly dismissed.This is symbolized in the movie when the writer/director reduces the Black experience in America to that of a little black kid in the movie "Magnolia" singing an incoherent rap song as the only way the kid can communicate to a white Los Angeles policeman about a crime the little kid may know about. Naturally, the white cop ignores the little kid. Later, the same policeman does not pay much attention to a suspicious looking guy in a brown jacket running through heavy rain in the kid's neighborhood.If the black kid in this movie has anything to say, it is not as critical to the white experience of life being represented in this movie. Everyone should be well aware by now that Hollywood has always relied on stereotypes to belittle the Black experience in America. Why else would the writer/director of "Magnolia" have the little kid sing a rap song to the white cop in an obvious reference to the days of Black vaudeville?Also, two of the African-Americans in this movie, of which there are only three (in Los Angeles?), are portrayed as disturbed or insignificant characters whose only refuge from a hard life in LA is crime. Witness the same little black kid later in the movie when he takes a load of cash from the purse of an Anglo woman (Julianne Moore) he finds passed out inside of her top-of-the-line Mercedes parked in the pouring rain. The other African-American character portrayed is a poor and obese woman who has a dead body in her closet and the other a dispassionate African-American female newscaster who is interviewing the character played by Tom Cruise.Of course, when the main characters in this movie, who are upper-class whites, have some major frustrations to express, it's okay for them to contort their faces and blow a gasket, curse at family and strangers in public and private, or steal money from their employer (with conscience intact), or preach misogyny (without a conscience) to angry white men, as three of the main characters in this movie will do.If anything is being said in this movie, it is that some people who reside in Southern California are amoral and tend to lead grossly immoral lives and like to wallow in their guilt. I hope that the writer/director of "Magnolia" does not feel this way about all of American society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, but less would have been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of those films where less would have been more. In attempting to do so much, the film actually suffered from excessive brilliance. Paul Thomas Anderson gives us a powerful auteur piece that succeeds on most levels, but comes up short of its true potential.The story follows one day in the lives of nine major characters and a host of minor ones whose lives are loosely connected to one man by various threads. Anderson does inspired work, giving us deep character development for each of the nine. Many themes run through the work, but the most pervasive is that of guilt and remorse. Moreover, almost every effort at atonement was rejected or thwarted in some way, evoking great pathos and a sense of despondent fatalism. This is clearly some of the best and most thought provoking dark writing ever done.From a directorial standpoint, the film was a magnificent display of directorial virtuosity. Anderson handled scenes, actors and visual details with the flair of a maestro. The swirl of scenes from character to character, the use of the camera and music, the juxtaposition of scenes, everything was superbly done. Yet, the whole was less than the sum of the parts due to Anderson's inability to let go of elements that encumbered the film (an irony since one of the main themes of the story was about being able to let go). Michaelangelo once commented that inside every block of marble, there is a masterpiece, and the sculptor needs only cut away the right pieces. Editing is one of most excruciating tasks of an auteur since each excision discards part of his soul. However, stoical editing is the area that differentiates great writer/directors from the good ones.This film had everything necessary to be one of the truly great films of our times, but it suffered from excess. There were too many characters. The story would have lost almost nothing by eliminating Donnie (William Macy), Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Claudia (Melora Walters). These characters really didn't add that much to the philosophical points being made in the film and made the film unwieldy. This would have trimmed forty-five minutes to an hour from the film and turned the focus more on the relationship between Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) and his son Frank (Tom Cruise) that was the very best element of the film.Also, Anderson went overboard on the profanity. I am no prude in this regard. I believe that profanity adds realism to a film because people are frequently profane in real life. I disdain the self-righteous prigs who are offended by it. However, overuse of any device to the extent that it starts to burden the story ultimately detracts from it. Anderson crossed that line. It seemed like he was trying to set a record for frequency and volume of vulgar expletives. If all the profanity were edited out, the film would have been 30 minutes shorter and Julianne Moore would have had about five lines.Finally, the plague of the frogs taken from Chapter 8 of Exodus was ill advised, as was the chorus of song by all the major characters at their point of greatest despondency. Anderson was trying to make important points with both of these devices, but in the process, they trivialized an exceptionally powerful drama to the point of eye rolling incredulity.Anderson was so uncompromising about every detail of his artistic vision that he missed the Big Picture (pun intended). The final version that was released would have been better released later as the director's cut. If Anderson had edited the theatrical release effectively, he could have had it both ways. He could have had a commercial success, critical acclaim, and he still could have given people an opportunity to see his entire vision. As to the acting, this is probably the best ensemble performance I have ever seen. Tom Cruise was nominated for a best supporting Oscar and much as I love Michael Caine and his performance in `The Cider House Rules', this was no contest. Cruise was electrifying. This was one of his best performances ever. I also thought Jason Robards' performance was worthy of supporting actor nomination. He was tremendous as the dying patriarch. The rest of the cast was phenomenal without exception.It is easy to understand why this film failed at the box office (at $23M, it grossed $14M less than its $37M budget). It was far too abstruse, intense, dark, philosophical and wry (not to mention lengthy) to have popular appeal. Of those who actually saw it, most either loved it or hated it. I must admit to feeling both emotions. I loved its genius but I hated that its final form didn't do that genius justice. Thus, I rated it an 8/10. It will undoubtedly become a cult classic rather than the true classic it could have been. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something a bit out of the ordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** The following text contains a couple of small spoilers**********After watching Magnolia I was left with a feeling that I had been witness to something a bit out of the ordinary, at last after wading through a spate of films that promised so much but failed to deliver I was at last satisfied.The directors ability to take on such issues as child molestation, drug abuse, Cancer etc, with a non-judgmental camera, to be honest left we emotionally stunned and drained. After the some what flawed but nevertheless powerful Boogie Nights P.T. Anderson has given us a movie that screams his existence from the hill tops of Hollywood.What most impresses me about P.T.Anderson is his ability to get such powerful performances from his actors. In Boogie Nights he got from the little known Mark Wahlberg a performance that many seasoned pro's would be proud of and from Burt Reynolds the performance of a lifetime. In Magnolia he got a performance from Tom Cruise that left many viewers rushing to the credits to make sure that this really was Cruise and not some long lost brother who had never been tempted by things like Mission Impossible 2.P.T.Andrson also impressed in his ability to string such long camera shots in seamless scenes that brought powerful and gut wrenching emotions home without having to bash the viewer over the head with each point.I know that certain scenes where viewed with raised eyebrows and slight sniggers. Scenes such as when the whole cast burst into song, " was I suddenly watching a musical" one critic asked. Well the answer is no, what you where watching was a string of very powerful scenes such as a women attempting suicide whilst her husband was lying in bed dying of Cancer that where being narrated by a brilliant song that took over the script. What you where watching was a role reversal, instead of the actors delivering lines with a song in the background, you where watching the song delivering the lines and the actors do the backing song. The music was so important to this film that in several parts it took over to produce such a powerful display of emotions that it truly blew my hair back.The other scene that seemed to produce a certain amount of ill feeling was the end scene between the Jim the Cop (brilliantly played by the much underrated John C Riley) and Claudia (equally well played be Merlora Walters). Critics didn't like that they couldn't really understand what the Jim was saying to Rose. The point is that it doesn't matter what he is saying. The camera is souley looking at the face of Rose because at the end of the unheard Cops speech she smiles. A non-drug induced smile of a tortured lady that for once in her torrid life feels safe and loved. Its that reaction that we should be looking for not the things that the cop is saying. It is a film of reactions and emotions, the last emotion that we see is of one of happiness.I know that these thoughts are very personalised and some may say flawed. However a film such as Magnolia should not be misunderstood and filed under "I'll watch it at some point" just because some people felt that some scenes didn't work for them. I feel that it is a travesty that so many people will never watch this film because they have heard of scenes where the whole cast break into song or scene where they cant hear what it is being said. If you watch and don't like it fair enough, but don't persuaded other people not to see it, because things that you didn't connect with they, like me as a Cancer sufferer, may find so real and touching and heartbreaking that they feel truly touched by a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a very well crafted film from the writer/director of the excellent Boogie Nights. Although the film is three hours long you never seem to get bored or fed up with it as the characters are interesting and there is more you want to find out about them.The film has a very serious and dark tone through out 2 and half-hours but the end totally changes the tone of the film. (Slight Spoiler) This is one of the most unexpected endings in a film but it isn't a twist. I know that sounds strange but you will just have to watch it to understand. (End Spoiler).There is some fantastic performances from John C Reilly, William H Macy and the Show stealer Tom Cruise (his best film since Jerry Maguire). He deserved the Golden Globe and should have received at least a nomination at the Oscars.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best directors around at the moment just behind David Fincher and Ridley Scott. He once again proves this in this film and can easily manipulate the audience emotions form seriousness to comedy in a few seconds, He Is also no stranger to shocking the audience in the ending.The plot is not formulaic in anyway breaking many conventions of typical Hollywood films as of late. The beginning is also a fresh way to start a film as it doesn't have anything to really do with the film but is interesting and even funny in a dark way.This film although not as good as Boogie nights still is a good piece of art and is one of the better films of 2000/1999. I would rate this with a high 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One deep movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of heavy-message movie you could see 10 times and still not quite know what they're trying to say. As near as I can figure, it's about relationships between father and son, father and daughter and husband and wife. It's about how people who treat their spouses and children with contempt eventually come to be filled with remorse about it. It's too long and too hard to figure out. You shouldn't have to see a movie 10 times to understand it. The character I enjoyed most was the cop played by John C. Reilly, who was also great as Gus Sinski in "For the Love of the Game." The rest of them are forgettable, and most of them are not even likeable. Great frog scene though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is a glorious mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia, P.T. Andersons third effort is like a train wreck waiting to happen. When you finally reach the scene where the frogs start falling from the sky everything seems to go out of control. For me, it was the moment of clarity, when everything came together perfectly. At more than three hours, Magnolia is a very exhausting film experience. But it is Anderson's stunning directorial virtuosity and incisive script which holds everything together and keeps you engrossed in the characters and their problems. Like Boogie Nights, Anderson has assembled an incredible ensemble cast, with stand out performances by John C. Reily, Philip Seymour and Philip Baker Hall.Aimee Mann provides the haunting score which is integral to the story and characters. Magnolia is a kaleidoscope of colors. It is always changing in shape and form. You find something new every time you watch it. Ignore the detractors for this film and experience it for your self. Thank you P.T. Anderson for keeping cinema alive for a new generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I will say that I would not rent this movie on a night when I want to have fun w/my friends. I've seen the movie about 4 or 5 times by now, and I know that if you actually want to be watching &lt;Magnolia&gt; the whole way through, it demands too much attention to a 'solemn' and 'earnest' state of mind. And if you watch the entire thing, your mood will stay that way for at least a few more hours after.There are some things, however, that I find hard to believe that anyone could ignore. 2 areas of this film are at its best. (1): The screenplay. This script is so-o-o gut-wrenching, and so very honest, it's almost scary! But the screenplay wouldn't go far either without (2) superb acting. How many of us can say that Tom Cruise DIDN'T deserve that Oscar?! Or any of the other actors, for that matter? It tires me when I hear about how Tom Cruise should never have picked such a 'mysoginistic' part, or whatever. OK, so Samuel Jackson can say mothaf&amp;^%r everytime he blasts someone's head off, Christian Bale can insanely laugh and sing while he throws chainsaws at people, but a character like Frank TJ Mackey(I think that was his name); whose character was emotionally abused as a child(and so has a reason to be the way he is), is so well played by Cruise, I can't believe that would even be an issue. This is a MOVIE. And not even a violent one.I'll admit that I didn't particularly favour the directing style the times that I did see the movie. BUT-And this is important-many innovative director's styles, in the beginning, are frowned upon. It takes a lot of guts for Anderson to sway the camera in this direction, and then in that direction, just because he felt that's a feeling he wanted to evoke to the audience; not caring at how unconventional it looks.All in all, this movie is definitely inspirational for aspiring filmmakers with open minds, seeking a new style, a new way to get your message across.Hey, like some other user comments stated, I don't know that I fully understand the message he was getting across, except that certain things just happen, and they are beyond our control. Yes, THAT's what I got out of it.-Sep</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;&lt; ENDING SPOILER &gt;&gt;Where was this movie 12 years ago when I was in college? This thing begs to be over-analyzed, watched again, made into more than it is, and found fault with. Mix in an indie-movie intro, some hip coffee shop music (sell the soundtrack on the side), some A list actors in B movie roles, multiple story lines with not enough connections to each other to be meaningful, an improbable yet controversial climax, and an irrelevant ending, and what do you get?3 hours of trying too hard.This movie could have been 4 great movies, or it could have been woven together into one fantastic movie. It screams out to be directed by someone else, someone who can coalesce all the fantastic performances and plots and emotions into a coherent whole. I know, all the others are saying "well that's the beauty of it, things just happen randomly and that's life", but that doesn't mean that the MOVIE has to be random!The frog scene was, in retrospect, a very meaningful event for the film. But for such a meaningful moment, why do the characters just troddle on with nothing to say? Are they amazed? Are they confused? Do they have a cathartic moment? No, they are simply tired. As are we at this point.I have yet to see a 3+ hour movie that needed to be 3 hours. Please, ye screen gods, at least bring back intermission !!!!I will need to view this film approximately 3 1/2 more times to fully understand all it has to offer.-Toblerone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia, as the Los Angeles Times has said, is drunk and disorderly on the pure joy of making movies. We need not look any further than it's trailer to see how original and exciting a movie experience can become. In fact, for all my anticipation, having seen and loved Boogie Nights, having heard and loved Aimee Mann, having watched and loved almost all the cast (especially Mrs. Moore and Mr. Reily) Magnolia was a let down at first; I expected ambition, and found chaos: chaotic to a point of losing it's own ambitious structure. There were weak, forced attempts on Levinson/Tarantino banter (Donnie ranting about his braces, "is this the worm?"), where Boogie Nights had a casual comedy within an original pace, something which, if it had been in Magnolia, might have become a PTA trademark. Mr. Anderson wants to say everything, show everything; and the result is a camera less assured, editing not as crisp, acting less restrained, less subtle, less structured, less -- after a while -- actually becoming more. There's a certain amount of excitement from Magnolia's flaws, wherein the term "perfect" may not be so wrongly labeled. Behind the rip-offs (of which Mr. Anderson even awknoadged in the original DVD of Boogie Nights), behind his show-off style, his Altman-esque ensembles and Godard-esque close-ups (quite beautiful), lies a real love of movies. And though his views may be different, his ideas a bit self-satisfying, Mr. Anderson's grasp of what makes a movie move, shake, rattle, and roll, is something not to be missed. I dislike the term "autuer", I don't even really know how to spell it, but seeing a PTA movie can be like nothing else. As Pauline Kael wrote in her review of Nashville, "Is there such a thing as an orgie for movie lovers?": yes. If it weren't for The Limey, Magnolia would've been my favorite of '99.One last thing: on the basis of the "Paper Bag" video alone, not to mention "Across the Universe", let's hope PTA's next project will be a musical costumed within fedoras, old-style caddies, soda jerks, and the beautiful Fiona Apple; perhaps a joint effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia manages to hook you from the word go (the pre-titles sequence is brilliant). The acting is first-rate, and the film is stylistically brilliant. However, it is fundamentally flawed, and doesn't live up to the promise of those first 10 minutes. The "Wise Up" sing-along is totally embarrassing, and is a symbol of the film's victory of style-over-content.The whole film leaves you with a feeling of "What was all that about?" and "Why did they bother?" (similar to Eyes Wide Shut). A great disappointment after Boogie nights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it very strange to look through the comments posted for this film. Seems like most people loved it, and a handful of people loathed it. I suppose I shouldn't see it as strange though, it fits right into the anti-pop mold. People that hate things simply because other people like them. That's probably the most juvenile behavior in the world, and I'll never understand it. Are you that desperate to be different? Compared to most of the c**p in theaters these days, this film is a gem. Even on its own, it's still a gem. Sure, the subject matter may be tired and overworked, but the acting and composition of the film were outstanding.Another comment that I've seen several times is that all the characters, like Boogie Nights, are simply pathetic and/or crazy, and the viewer can, in no way, relate to these people. Everyone is crazy or pathetic in their own little way. If you think you're not, that's your first problem. Most of us may not be as troubled as Julianne Moore's character or the coke addict, but think of how many people there are out there that ARE like that. More than you realize, probably. And that's the point. People get that way, things happen to make them that way.This film was as good as any I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of P.T. Anderson's work. This movie features an ensemble cast that includes critically acclaimed actors like Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John Reilly, Jullianne Moore, and William H. Macy. However, the entertainment of such an original movie with exciting twists and turns along with stellar film editing and original writing and superb acting fades away as the movie drags on and on and on and on. I was left begging for the film to fade to black with twenty minutes left. Now, some of my favorite movies are the Godfather and Braveheart, both with extremely long running times. But this movie really kept me checking my watch periodically. It's a good movie, but if you're the kind of person who watches movies once in a blue moon, don't see this one.

		<shortDescription>about Tom Cruise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to make of "Magnolia" as a whole. I know I loved it. I know its exuberant display left me purring with pleasure. But I'm not at all sure it was any good. It may, or may not, have been terrible: I really can't tell. (Don't let me sound mean-spirited. It may also have been great.)But I can tell you that Tom Cruise WAS magnificent. Previously, I'd never really liked him. Even in simple roles ("Legend", "Top Gun", "Days of Thunder") he's failed to convince me; he struck me as being out of his depth in things like "Born on the Fourth of July", "The Firm", "Mission: Impossible" and even "Jerry Maguire"; and although he did well in "Eyes Wide Shut" (his best film), I still wish the role had been handed to someone else.But the past is the past. No-one shines more brightly in "Magnolia" than he. When we first see Frank T.J. Mackey he's performing in front of an audience, and doing so brilliantly, expertly manipulating his audience, yet EFFORTLESSLY, too, almost (but not quite) lazily - maximum effect with minimum effort, the self-help guru equivalent of Paganini. Then there's that harrowing interview with a journalist... When he returns to his audience he's no longer Paganini. He still struts the stage and still gets much the same effect, but we can see now that he's straining for it. Cruise isn't too obvious about it. He doesn't telegraph. He just allows one or two cracks to appear in Mackey's performance. And he acts just as well in the remainder of the film. Some critic, commenting on "Eyes Wide Shut", said that Tom Cruise should never, ever, be asked to cry in front of the camera, and at the time I agreed. I no longer agree. -I know there are people out there who think Cruise was actually bad in this role; I think they're nuts.As I say, I don't know what to make of "Magnolia". I certainly don't know what to make of the title. Does anyone have any idea what it means? Any idea at all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that makes you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS Magnolia is more than 3 hours long, the dialog is driven by the word f**k, and the ending turns a lot of people off. However, for a movie of it's length Magnolia moves quickly threw 3 or 4 different stories. The stories are intriguing, and the movie is extremly well acted. The movie is deep to great extents sometimes spilling out almost poetic sentences in the middle of everyday conversation. The most memorable part of the movie is the "surprise" ending that turned a lot of people off from the film. However, i feel that the ending stays true to the film, and indeed conects the stories and characters. To understand the ending you must look back to the start of the film which shows several examples of strange, umexpected occurrences, that are looked at as "coincidences". This is to illustrate that strange unpredictable things happen all over the world. This theme is quietly shown throughout the entire film. One thing that I noticed was that at the start of every day there would be a weather report for the coming day. This is to illustrate that we are always trying to predict what is to come. however, of course no one predicted the weather that comes at the end of the movie. This is to illustrate that we cannot predict what is going to come, because the unexpected is always bound to happen. This is how the characters are connected, throught the THEME. the frogs are a representation of the unexpected, the unexplained that touches and aplies to every main character in the film.It shows that we cannot try to predict the future, we just have to try and do the right thing along the way. This is why the film ends with John C.Reilly's character doing the right thing, by helping his "girlfriend" with her addiction. The movie ends on this note because it sums up the theme and message of the movie. we don't need the stories to connect in the tradition way of all the characters meeting somehow, the movie is driven by theme and symbolism that make it a great movie to watch and think of for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about regret, by Men who have behaved badly in the past, and now that they are dying, seek forgiveness. A Lady racked by guilt because she married for money and now her husband is dying. A boy who pisses his pants in a game show, A daughter who was the victim of child abuse, A couple of life's looser's, and the standout performance by Tom Cruise who plays the part of the boy whose father left him after he found out his mother was dying of cancer. Needless to say, Tom grows up to hate his father with a vengence, but how this makes him into a womans worst nightmare come true is unclear. (unless the woman happens to like Men who exploit them for the sole purpose of having sex)Somehow all these seemingly unrelated characters and scenes all come together in a film which makes some strong statements about the way we treat each other, especially children.In my opinion the most touching scene in the film was when the young boy stands up for himself. Here you have a gifted child, but lacking in confidence. He is taken advantage of by everyone, by his father, adults, and worst of all his peers. Yet he is trying so hard to be accepted that he just keeps taking all the crap. Fortune is on his side however, but in a crafty guise. He begs to go to the rest-room but to no avail. Again and again he begs, but no-one is taking him seriously. Meanwhile because he is concentrating so hard on holding his bladder he stops answering questions. His side start falling further behind in points. Then the ineviatable happens. A kids worst nightmare in ultimate embarrassment... The time comes for him to represent his team for the final round. He refuses to budge and who can blame him. Nothing can be worse that what has already happened, and he has enough common sense not to make it any worse. He has finally seen the light. At last he is standing up for himself.Later that night he tells his disfunctional father that he is going to have to start to be nicer to him. Not a chance that his father is going to change voluntarily, but one can sense, that this is one boy who has will not take any more nonsense.Too shay, Nothing good happens in this life without standing up for yourself and your belief's. The younger one can learn this, the luckier one is.</fullReview>

Most of them might complain about the ending, but that's because they'd be ignorant to the Biblical reference, which was actually fore-shadowed in a brief shot of the "What Do Kids Know Audience" in a sign that read "Exodus 3:8". Subtle inclusions such as that and the length, would most probably turn off most people that walk into the store or the movie theater.Again, I don't think I'm "better" than any of them because I liked it. I just think that it would turn away most people. I also have to say, I don't think it was the greatest film ever made. There are reviewers who think it's perfect, but it most certainly had it's flaws.There were parts were the script and the acting could have been stronger. The inclusion of the "sing-a-long" seemed a bit redundant, for instance.I for one, incidently, did not really notice the length. There's a lot of movies that are half the length that I keep looking to my watch to to find out how much longer I have to endure them, it didn't happen once with this movie.In conclusion, if you like most of the things out in a movie theater, avoid this movie. If you don't, you'll absolutely love it.</fullReview>

I was enthralled with the stories. Then Paul Thomas Anderson decided to insert this musical montage. I had real problems with it. To have two nearly comatose characters lip synch to a pop song blew it for me. I then saw the characters as actors acting a role. I could suspend belief and get involved in the lives of the people portrayed before the montage but afterwards I watched craft. The story no longer touched me. I was just waiting for the final reel to tie up loose ends. This movie could have been a classic. It could have been a contender. Was the music meant to tie the characters together, to link the separate stories. Isn't that what writing is for? Couldn't he use a less obvious device? That montage will look really goofy in 10 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening sequence of Magnolia is one that I will never forget.Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights can best be described as a seedy film about a seedy business (the pornography industry). I loved Boogie Nights. I loved Magnolia, which can be described as a haunting epic about forgiveness.PT Anderson uses much of the same cast members as he did in Boogie Night, including the superb Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly . . . to convey his brilliant film about the intertwining lives of several people, including a dying television producer, his beautifully screwy wife, his estranged son, a gameshow host dying of cancer, his drug-addicted estranged daughter, a young genius, a sensitive nurse, an interviewer, a police officer, and a former child genius.Two additions that Magnolia couldn't have done without were Tom Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, the man behind the "Seduce and Destroy" method of dating, and Jason Robards, as the dying television producer. The performances of Cruise, Robards, Moore, and Walters were my favorites. They bring such misery to their roles.Memorable scenes: opening scenes, Aimee Mann song "Wise Up," frogs (no further explaination)Also, buy the soundtrack by Aimee Mann (plus a few others). It's haunting and mesmerizing.</fullReview>

Director Paul Thomas Anderson's (Boogie Nights) mammoth film (200 minutes long) illicits the very best out of his sprawling entourage (12 main characters). Cruise has simply never been better, mocking his narcisstic image mercilessly. The terrifically ambitious Magnolia presents us with a microcosm of American society through nine intertwined stories that each take place on one clement day in Southern California, during which all manner of torrents are unleashed. Obviously, much like Robert Altman's Short Cuts, with so many tales, some characters will grab your attention more than others. An astonishing turn from Stanley Spector as a child genius turned quiz show star stands-out. As does Anderson favourite John C. Reilly as a bumbling LAPD officer. Ultimately, Magnolia is patently too long, but because of its staggering invention it must be forgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable Film That Could Go Either Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You either liked Magnolia, or you loathed it. There is barely no one who sits on the fence and claims indifference. It's impossible to be neutral to a film like this because it plays itself out to the very extreme. Some will savor the experience; others will find it unbearable.At over 3 hours, Magnolia comes with a lot of baggage. It is a mighty test of the audiences endurance and sheer stamina. Few films can put you through this type of journey. I found Magnolia to be a well-crafted expose of the lives of various people in and around the San Fernando Valley over the course of 48 hours. During that time, these people have to confront their inner demons and attain some sort of enlightenment amidst this bleak, harrowing life that they lead.This idea is not original, in fact it smells particularly like an Altman dish. Altman's 'Short Cuts' followed a similar plot formula and also lasted 3 hours. The difference with this film is that, unlike Short Cuts, the film's various stories do have a neat and interesting conclusion. Magnolia doesn't end inconclusively; these people's lives will make sense and they will all come together by the end of it.Director Anderson, who brought Boogie Nights to us, uses many of the same actors. Even though these characters are different from those in Boogie Nights, we still feel a certain affinity to them. Scorsese often uses this concept; he casts many of the same actors in his films, thus as the movie opens we already feel like we know them. Like in Boogie Nights, the subject matter dealt with, is not pretty. We have drugs, sex, death, homosexuality...you name it. From that description, many would say American Beauty springs to mind. It's true the issues confronted are often the same, but Magnolia is less subtle, and less sleek. Still, we should not write it off as a fine piece of cinema.The structure of the film is also very similar to Anderson's previous effort. The first half is like the build up to an operatic chorus; the tempo gets more and more dramatic until it reaches fever pitch. There is bang that is designed to really move us and bring out our deepest emotions.The second half starts with the tempo rescinding, but we slowly start to feel the momentum picking up again. And we know the final climax is gonna be even more explosive. This idea is always in fear of being ridiculed if it's not done right. The idea must be to have each climax genuinely meaningful and dramatic. Audiences today are rarely shocked because they've seen it all before, so to succeed in getting their attention, is a very tall order. I, for one liked the way the cookie crumbled; the bizarre denouement was especially memorable.The acting here cannot be faulted. I am not exaggerating when I say that I can't recall a finer ensemble piece ever. The performances all round are dynamic in scope and the range and potential each actor shows is truly remarkable. Cruise, oscar-nominated, as he was, is astonishing. He has never before demonstrated this sort of on-screen captivity; his effort goes unnoticed, and he must now have finally cemented himself as a good actor by everyone's standards. If you are is still not convinced after this performance; you'll never be!!!The stories here are often inter-connected as you may guess but they are far from predictable. This is good because the audience's attention does not wither. You ought to feel curious as to how it will all come together. If not, then the experience is likely to be dire, to say the least. As I said, Magnolia is like a roll of the dice; you don't know what you are going to get. Some will savor the experience, others will feel hard done-by. It is difficult to predict who will and who will not like it. It is certainly not a safe bet. It is a massive gamble that will not always pay off. From the entertainment standpoint, the odds of success are minimal. I say this because your average cinema go-er will be tired and bored and will have finished his popcorn box with 2 hours till to spare.I, for one, managed to get through the experience with some energy to spare. Not a lot, mind you!! I did at times feel exhausted, but ultimately I profited from the experience. The roll of dice had my number on it. I don't even think about arguing with those that hated it because I see exactly where they are coming from. To argue this films worth would also feel like a real ordeal. With Magnolia there is a very fine line you walk between liking it and hating it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** 1/4 stars Strange journey that makes you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is on of those movies that will lose you and make you go "Huh??", But it was beautifully done and interesting because it does make you think and tests your strength by the length- 3 hours and the confusing stories and the meaning behind it all. Anderson shows things that you must look into and think about, during and after you have seen it. You will get lost in the shuffle but open your mind and you may understand the ending.PLOT: One day and the actions of- A dying father, his young wife, his nurse, and estranged son. A game show host, his strung out daughter. A young prodigy and his father who wants him to excel. A hardworking cop trying to solve a crime and girl. A former gamshow contestant who thinks he has no worth.VIEWS: Again this movie is hard to understand but you watch for the performances rather then the storylines. All the stories do intertwine and mean something. There are hidden things going on. Many were amazed by Tom Cruise's performance which was good but this movie is more about the group of performers rather then just one. Take the time to let your mind go and just watch by what is going on even if it is hard to understand.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: Tom Cruise's stage performance and meeting his dying father, The nurse on the phone, the frogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well I guess that the 5 minute break i took to stop my nosebleed must have held some of the most amazing bits of the film because everyone else seems to have loved it. i think it was too long. i didnt get the bit where the cop heard the black kid rap and then later he chases some other black kid and gets shot at and loses his gun... and then the first black kid finds the woman who commits suicide. (if you wanna email and explain it to me, feel free). was the only point to let the cop be a bit of a failure by losing his gun and make sure the suicide gets phoned in? did the kid represent more? in some situations this sort of mystery would intrigue me but it just annoys me here. I thought Tom cruise was a good actor and I liked his character. if you have nothing better to do and you have a long attention span then go see it, see if it makes more sense to you than to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites of last year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAGNOLIA is a movie about regret, not coincidence as the opening scene tells us in a somewhat caricaturesque manner. What moves this film is about doing wrong things and not thinking about the consequences. There's a song that the characters sing (as odd as it sounds) during a hilarious sequence: "It's not going to stop, till you wise up" or something like that. And that's what I'm talking about. Why losing contact with your family and changing your name? Is it going to help? Why being a drug addict? Why marry an old man for his money? Why doing all this if you are going to regret it someday and live miserably? Why not facing all these problems for once and for all? Those are some of the questions this smart film asks. And while it gives us the answer -to wise up- it does not have a satisfying ending. It's actually funny how surreal the ending is. Like there is no solution to this problem unless something really strange happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Premise - Slightly Unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great premise of a movie - owes an awful lot to Altman, and Short Cuts in particular (attempted suicide in garage, lecherous cop, reunion of relatives in face of imminent death, supernatural occurance etc being the narrative similarities; multiple stories of everyday confused folk being the subject matter; 'aren't folk messed-up' being the common theme...) [If only they'd kept it in the style of the three opening stories (of stuff that just happened) throughout the movie...?]Yet somehow Altman is a better storyteller - P.T. Anderson is a master of issue avoidance - how many times did he dodge the crux of a scene, having a character say "The thing about my problem/idea is..." at the crucial dramatic peak, before cutting away to the next person. We got to see who these people were, and how they were different from each other, but very little about what made these well delineated individuals actually tick.Similarly, inter-cutting several different stories as they reach their little climaxes is no substitute for making any one climax moving/dramatic. A cop struggling around in the rain for his gun is not made any more or less involving for the intercutting with a kid not answering questions on a TV show because he needs the bathroom. And with Tom Cruise sitting out an interview in silence, and a nurse on perpetual hold on a telephone being thrown into the mix, it's more a case of anti-climaxes than climaxes - so why the histrionic, tension building crescendos on the sound-track?!?Only the 'plague of frogs' ending really elevated it onto something wholly original, but it did keep going... and going... (again, anti-climaxes).The performances - well, most of the praise has been given, and the majority has been justified. Cruise got an Oscar nomination, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is flavour of the month with the independent cinema crowd; Julianne Moore has done her best work for both Altman and Anderson. Yet watch how all three have key scenes with Jason Robards, the real pro in the film as far as I am concerned. He demonstrates a sureness of touch with underplaying his scenes to just the right degree, not flinching as the others spit out the sawdust from chewing the scenery by comparison. Alright, it's a difficult role to go wrong with by compared to them, but notice that he neither responds melodramatically when they interact with him, nor lies there completely silently and still like so many other movie-patients - a really well judged physical and emotional performance.Overall, I really liked the detail - so much of it. But what I worried about was that detail had been included at the expense of clarity. It was lovely to finally notice that it was Robards' Earl Partridge that had produced the kids TV show that Philip Baker Hall had been presenting, but wouldn't it have been a tiny bit better if I had noticed that a little earlier on (and how many people were there in the cinema with me who missed it?)A really great film that didn't quite get there, (but continually kept me absorbed), or perhaps two not really spectacular movies mixed together in the hope that they would create a greater impression than the individual parts (which they didn't - two wrongs don't make a right).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice men, hysteric women - just a coincidence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The perfect alternative for somebody who had been disappointed by "American Beauty". The story line is similar to "Short Cuts" (the apocalyptic punishment in the end!). "Magnolia" has its advantages in the density of acting and action, while Altman's movie sketches lacks of society better. Who can say what's the more brilliant movie? But "Magnolia" is too long, really, while it's the first film, in which the permanent Hollywood music sauce got not on my nerves... They use is dramatically, after two hours of music Anderson put in some silent moments... Besides, the music consists of songs, which are chosen very tastefully. I liked the characters, especially the Cop Jim and the male nurse Phil. The men were sketched with some more affection, but the women cried too much and shouted too loud. Coincidence? The introduction is perhaps the best I'v ever seen. With these little stories of coincidence the spectator gets into a suction he can't escape for the rest of time (of his life?). The Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise I can't understand, he is the worst actor in the film. But I'm interested in the white and blue book of Frank Mackey, can somebody help me where to buy "Seduce and destroy"???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy movie, the past has not finished with us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was an original and uplifting movie, one that stretches the definition of American cinema with its clever use of narration, music and overlapping themes.This is the first Anderson movie I have seen, and it inspires me to catch the others. It is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction in the way it intertwines the story lines, but it is much more subtle. Walking out of the cinema, I turned to my companion and said, that was a crazy movie but I am not sure what it was about. The event seemed to be bigger than the message.It was the kind of movie you could tell everyone to go and see, but struggle to define. Recurrent themes, I suppose, were coincidence, chance, cancer, dysfunctionality, and above all, hope and redemption. I liked the way the story lines never quite got sorted at the end even with all the coincidental connections, it is not a neat, Hollywood ending and is all the better for that.One clever aspect of the movie was how the direction played with our notions of what characters were motivated by- for instance, when the nurse orders Playboy and Hustler on the phone, and when Earl Partridge's wife orders the drugs to finish him off, we are manipulated into thinking their motives are venal, and perhaps in her case they were- but she either had a Damascene conversion or I read it wrong.It is good to see movies that stretch your mind and trip you up. The plague of frogs scene certainly stretched my mind, as did the scene where all the characters sung the same song as they went about their lives and deaths. Short mentions must be made of the overall music score, the acting and the imaginative use of narration and news clips/historical re-enactions. Bye the way, I think that Tom Cruise guy might have a future in acting- a perfect combination of slimeball sleaze and business seminar delivery, a concept as post-ironic as anything I have seen in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I'm going to upset a few people when I write this, but I don't know how people can fool themselves into liking this movie. You can say that it was well made because the first half hour was excellent, I truly thought that the movie was going to be brilliant, but it just dragged for another 3 hours. By the end of the movie I was left with a whole heap of unanswered questions, which annoyed me.The characters were all so pathetic and annoying, they all whinged and cried and wouldn't shut up. I hated every character so much that it made me cringe when they spoke. But just because I hated the characters didn't mean that the acting was bad, because I believe Tom Cruise was excellent, he did the best with what little script there was. The way the characters all acted was as though they were given directions and told to improvise.I don't believe it was a real movie, because I don't believe it had a beginning middle and an end. It may be critically acclaimed, but those critics are going by the technical side of the movie, or they are jumping on the band wagon of someone else who said they liked it.Me, well I thought it was alright for what it was, but there is no way I want to waste another 3 and a half hours watching something for no reason, that just leaves you feel like you were robbed.2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I would have taken such a 'wise' lesson for granted but in this case no-one could've said it better than Aimee Mann. It provides one of the most emotional and beautiful scenes of the movie, no of all-time movie history. Characters starting to sing along with this moving song, frogs coming down from heaven. You all simply let it come to you.'Magnolia' with its 190 minutes is a true gem. A moving epic portraying people and the relationships they are in. Emphasizing the fact we are all connected to one another and how much people are capable of and how much people are able to hurt each other.All stories have a common core and it is interesting to see you can create branches starting from each individual character.In advance I read that this movie was hard to follow but I didn't have any problem with it. The characters were real as well as surreal. They are all interesting because of the growth they undergo. This is also what makes this movie so realistic. They all have needs, doubt and worries.Tom Cruise is truly excellent. This time he's not just Tom Cruise playing a character, no it's Tom Cruise playing a character. Julianne Moore is fabulous. An actress of classic allure. And surely she meant to have gotten the Oscar for best actress. I can hardly wait to see her starring as Clarice Starling in upcoming 'Silence of the Lambs' sequel 'Hannibal'. The scene in the drugstore is amazing in its simplicity yet its complicity.These are true emotions we're talking about.And the music of the movie is stunning. I never heard of Aimee Mann but she blasted me away. The movie is built around her songs (added with some extra sounds by director's girlfriend Fiona Apple and her and Mann's producer Jon Brion).I loved the presence of the music, also in the beginning when Mann sings the cover 'One'("One is the loneliest number"). Some scenes are almost being dominated by music without creating an annoying effect.Breathtaking, very long, but still breathtaking.9 out of 10 points. One of the best movies I've ever seen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the "Short Cuts" comparisons are justified (LA setting, multi-story structure, climax with a freak of nature) Magnolia is still a fine film in its own right. Anderson has followed up "Boogie Nights' with an ever better film. While some may call Magnolia sentimental, its a refreshing change from most recent American art movies, which seem to regard any human feeling whatsoever as lamentably unhip. Whatever else happens to him, Anderson can claim that he succeeded where the late Stanley Kubrick failed, by getting something resembling acting out of Tom Cruise. While Cruise's Goebbels of the sex wars is the flashiest example, Magnolia features several other against-type castings. Most notably, Philip Seymour Hoffman finally gets to show that he can play competent and dignified.The only unfortunate thing about the film is the soundtrack. The Aimee Mann songs aren't bad, but the incidental music is some of the most annoying and intrusive I've ever heard, often detracting from the action rather than complementing it.Incidentally, if you want to know what the opening narration and the frogs are about, keep a careful eye on the books Stanley reads in the library... then head to your local "cult" bookshop.</fullReview>

It's confusing. It's long. It's disgusting. It's beautiful. It's *weird*. It's good. It also contains a stunt showing in the cinemas, and good actors. You love and hate the characters. You feel sympathy for them in the end. Magnolia is a film you remember, and are forced to have meanings about. It's a beautiful name as well.The stunt in the theatres is that 10 minutes before the end, it suddenly stops. The lights come on. I didn't know about this before afterwards, I thought it was something wrong - it was thunder outside the cinema. The staff obviously weren't well informed about this, because they came in and were saying something about 'the projector went off!'. Hehe.There are many little clues in the film to notice. Names, etc. from the characters. One of my favourite actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman played the strong nurse Phil Parma, the professional, all-around-good-guy. This guy is amazing, as The Guardian, a UK newspaper said about him once: "He's there. He plays so good you get touched. You remember his face vaguely. But you don't really remember him. He's there, but you don't remember him. That's the thing about him and what makes him such a good actor."My favourite part in the film was the song all the characters knew..that was a beautiful effect.

I have been seeing a lot of other outstanding movies, from Green Mile to American Beauty to Being John Malkovich, but Magnolia far surpassed all of them.This is a movie about salvation; those who can be saved will be saved, those who cannot are lost. It is also one of the truest movies ever made, delving wonderfully into how so many different people deal with loss and suffering and how everyone has problems, whether they are a beat cop, a multi-millionaire television producer, or a cocaine addict. The emotional level of this film is incredible.I promise you that if you see this film, whether you like it or not, you will walk away from it with a different outlook on life.

Magnolia is a very fine film but lacked the cohesiveness and control of Boogie Nights.I have heard of a Directors (longer) cut of Boogie Nights is to be released this summer on DVD though and I fear that may suffer for the same reason Magnolia did. I don't mind long films but sometimes 'more' does not mean 'better'. I just think a little more restraint, and a clearer resoloution, would have improved Magnolia by a great deal.

		<fullReview>Again there is an american film which divides opinions in a remarkable way, among critics and audiences alike. And again, as it happens so often, I'm neither hating nor loving this film, I simply think that to a certain degree everyone is right with his judgement about "Magnolia". P.T. Anderson,whose previous films "Hard Eight" and "Boogie Nights" are unknown to me, has made an undoubtedly ambitious film and despite the flaws - and there are some in his new movie - I couldn't help but to admire the effort.The narrative structure of "Magnolia" is comparable to Robert Altmans "Short Cuts": It portrays a dozen of characters, combining and summarize their stories as the events of one day and night in the San Fernando Valley (Julianne Moore also reminds of Altmans film). So you get drama and emotions on a big scale and as it is reflected in the reactions of critics and the public alike, the emotionality of the movie proved too much for some. It is indeed hard to watch, because the pain and the sadness of the characters is shown very explicitly. I must admit that I also had problems with that direction and critics like John Petterson simply can't dismiss other people's reaction to "Magnolia" as unimaginative. Sure, the extent of this emotionality is what makes "Magnolia" so unusual, but also so unpleasant in some scenes. For example, when Frank mackey (Tom Cruise) has to do this interview and the reporter wants him to tell the truth about his family life and to tell what he feels about it - that's a scene where the voyeuristic approach of the film becomes clear. Moreover, in revealing the family tragedies of his characters, Anderson unfortunately sticks with old and over-used incest and exploitation cliches. Some words about the casting: we get a terrific ensemble though not every performance is as good as one might have hoped. I'm not so much talking about Julianne Moore (well, the scene in the pharmacy was bad, but apart from that I think the reaction of most people to her performance was a bit harsh). I must say folks, personally I found Melora Walters way more unnerving: the scene where Claudia goes nuts in front of her father, with Walters really screaming all the time, I was really tempted to shout back "No, YOU shut the f... up!". Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall and William H. Macy are always worth seeing, but Tom Cruise amazed me most (blimey, he can really act). He was simply unbelievable and I really hope we'll see him in more unexpected roles like this one. Though the film is problematic at times, it also is to the same degree stylish and ingenious in many scenes (particularly in the first hour). "Magnolia" is partly inventive and undeniably intense but it has too many flaws as that I would really recommend it. All in all, not one of the best of the year, but no failure either. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It never rains but it pours in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an airport novel of a movie, 3 hours long with at least 6 major plot lines involving 10 or so characters, all connected in some way, and told in numerous segments. It was all a bit reminiscent of "Nashville" without the multi-track sound or maybe "Pulp Fiction" without the blood and gore. All the main characters are facing some kind of personal crisis. Earl Partridge, TV producer of the long running quiz show " What Can Kids Tell Us" is lying in his palatial home dying from cancer. His anchorman, Jimmy Gator, has just discovered he too has the big C in terminal form and is trying to break the news to his family. Their brightest kid contestant is revolting over the exploitation of his youthful genius by the show and his father. Donnie, a former top quiz kid on the show now reduced to working in a discount store, has fallen in love with a beefy, boofy barman and is trying to win his love by getting his teeth fixed. Eric and Jimmy, Dads facing Death, are trying to make peace with their estranged children. Eric's son has changed his name, and is now Frank T J Mackie, misogynist motivational speaker who spreads the message that men ought to be bastards, but faces exposure for lying about his background at the hands of Gwenovier, an elegant black lady journalist who is impervious to his charms. Jimmy's daughter Claudia has fallen victim to cocaine but is about to be the subject of a rehabilitation attempt by a kindly (if a little simple-minded) LAPD officer. Earl's second wife Linda, who married him for his money, is in crisis over Earl's imminent demise, since she now realises she loves him. And Earl's kindly nurse Phil is having a hard time keeping order around the deathbed, what with the dogs and relatives and all. And it's raining all the time - in LA!All is resolved, of course, though with the aid of a supernatural event. My problem is that some viewers will see the ending in literal terms when all we really have is a bunch of clever young film makers sending up soap operas. Still, it's very funny at times and the script allows for some very good performances. There's a galaxy of good actors here - Jason Robards as Earl, Julianne Moore as Earl's wife Linda, Tom Cruise as son Frank, Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse, Philip Baker Hall as Jimmy Gator, John C Reilly as the LAPD officer, William H Macy as Donnie the ex-quiz kid, and Jeremy Blackman as the present quiz kid. Tom Cruise was particularly good at projecting Frank's bottled up rage behind his insufferable manner and his scenes with Jason Robards are genuinely moving.Movies like this, set in Hollywood with Hollywood types as characters are in some danger of disappearing up their own fundamental orifices - irrelevant to all except voyeurs. But here we can relate to at least some of their characters - their predicaments are not necessarily peculiar to those in show business. Perhaps what the film-makers have done is to show us that Hollywood folk suffer just like the rest of us from the human condition.Just a comment re the quiz show (much of the movie has us watching the making of an episode). The questions were ridiculously difficult eg "I'll give you a line in English from an opera and you sing it back to me in the original language after telling me which opera it's from". The kid answers perfectly. When he later refuses to answer another question the production assistant hisses "You know the answer, you always know." Is the show fixed? Surely that's not still going on? I don't know. Next thing somebody's going to show the Oscars are a fraud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endurance test, just about worth it (contains SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God this film is a mess! There is so much to admire, but so many miscalculations; the whole thing is self-important and self-indulgent, and not simply because of its great length (Kenneth Branagh's magnificent, full-text version of Hamlet was four hours long but to me worth every minute).The Good: The acting from Philip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffmann and Tome Cruise (and the woman who played his interviewer, of whose name I'm not sure); Aimee Mann's songs; the sheer ambition of it; a lot of the script; John Reilly's underplaying.The Bad: some of the female parts were (as some have commented already) woefully underwritten: I've never seen Julianne Moore in such a one-note performance, and I'm not sure it's her fault; Melora Walters is appealing but similarly hamstrung; the portentousness of the opening sequence is not matched by any great revelations in the script - it's as if Anderson thought nobody had ever done a film with a huge cast of people all linked together, to which the inevitable two-word response is: Short Cuts!The Ugly: The unbelievably obtrusive soundtrack. I've never walked out of a cinema in mid film, despite seeing some dire films like Pret A Porter and Sliver, but I wanted to run out screaming because of that bloody soundtrack, which at one point did not let up for what seemed like hours. It drowned the actors, made some of the dialogue inaudible, and was for me the most serious mistake, even worse than the frog rain - although I'm damned if I can see what that is supposed to be about.I would recommend this film to someone who has patience and a long attention span, and doesn't mind a film whose reach far exceeds its grasp. I think Hard Eight was an infinitely better film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with very high expectations. Being a big fan of Boogie Nights and of a number of the actors in the movie it was eagerly anticipated. I am happy to say I wasn't disappointed. Even though the running time seemed a little daunting at first the 3 hours seemed to fly by. All the performances are superb and Tom Cruise deserves the recognition of the awards and nominations. However the best of the performances goes to John C Reilly. Can this man do no wrong??? Never has a loser appeared so likeable without appearing dumb or being used as comic relief. The only gripe with the movie is that it is so damn confusing. It seemed to be about nothing in specific and just random stories connected by the most narrow of threads, and nothing really coming to a satisfactory conclusion throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rain, Rain!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least two thin people striving to burst out of one fat one? At least two two hour films are aching to burst out of Magnolia. But still these would be two very interesting movies. Boogie Nights, with which writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson announced his presence, also took its time. The over ambitious Magnolia, Anderson's latest movie, with its Altmanesque intermingling of at least nine plot lines, still paints a good many poignant portraits. It's worth the effort if you can choose to offer the time. But it's petty to harp on the three hours issue. The Green Mile is two hours seventy five minutes long someone quipped recently and no one is complaining.  Not many winged about the very long Schindler's list, not if they had actually seen it. And the comfort of the seats in a theatre is always inversely related to the quality of the entertainment. The plot elements of Magnolia are linked by the pervasive influence of television (screens are everywhere) by coincidence and by suffering. Magnolia begins with some outrageous real life coincidences and then begins to slip and slide about between its characters, gradually revealing what's interesting Anderson. A cop (John C. Reilly) comments on his job and his aspirations while he's on the job as they do in those TV shows. He unaccountably falls for a coke addict (Melora Walters) and eventually we learn her secret. A television game show host (Philip Baker Hall) is mortally ill as is the bed ridden Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). Their children and wives have a lot of soul searching to do. Tom Cruise plays Frank Mackey a woman hating motivational speaker with venom. Philip Seymore Hoffman portrays a caring nurse for the dying. William H. Macy, who's career has blossomed since Fargo, is Donnie, a miserable former quiz kid. And they there's Julianne Moore who's sorrow is palpable as she battles with guilt as her husband dies. As you can see Magnolia isn't a happy film. Gnashed teeth are everywhere and sometimes this becomes tiresome. But then again much of Magnolia is memorable, sometimes remarkably so. The scuba diver spiked on a tall pine tree, the earnestness of the nurse, the bartender with braced teeth and an astounding "rain" storm made this Magnolia well worth a sniff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short. Some superb moments of technical dexterity, several excellent performances - Tom Cruise reminds me again of what an undervalued actor he is, and Philip Baker Hall is quite extraordinary - and some moving scenes - I found Jason Robards' desperately poignant monologue very effective. It's too diffuse though, and the ending doesn't quite tie the package up as it seems intended to. It's too diffuse to be a masterpiece, and it doesn't have anything as exhilarating as the opening ten minutes of "Boogie Nights", but it's still much better than most of the pigswill that calls itself popular cinema. Nice to see it get such a wide release as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A POINTLESS, BUT FAR FROM BORING, TALE OF THE VALLEY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My god, what a mess. What a crazy, glorious, inspired mess. Much like the characters who Ping-Pong around the eventually surreal milieu of Paul Thomas Anderson's Let's-visit-the-San-Fernando-Valley-again follow-up to "Boogie Nights," this is a film out of control. Which is not to suggest that "Magnolia" is a bore. Unlike "Three Kings" that seemed to run out of steam as far as innovative and kinetic presentation (come on, who really gave a s**t about Clooney and Co. helping the fleeing Iraqis once the third act limped in?), "Magnolia" goes full-tilt until the credits roll. The only way you know this film clocks in at 188 minutes is to time it.Anderson keeps things moving at a clip that makes your average Joel Silver production seem like Merchant &amp; Ivory. Expanding the use of the techniques he used expertly in "Nights," Anderson zooms around these scenes so energetically you might think you had stumbled into an action film by mistake. Tracks with zooms, tracks with whip-pans propel you into and around scenes. No boring static shots here. A dinner scene between "Nights" alum's John C. Reilly and the wonderful Melora Walters is shot from a low angle so that even though we know that both are flawed, their stature is raised so we can admire their attempts to connect.Fancy camera moves and superb editing can only hold your interest for so long. As with "Boogie Nights," Anderson excels at getting top-notch performances for his characters. With the exception of Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlburg (who was out underwhelming in the aforementioned "Kings"), almost every actor shows up in "Magnolia." Tom Cruise is good, damn good in his juicy role of a very un-Alan Alda-ish self-help guru for p-whipped males, yet at its core it's still a part we've seen him play before in "Jerry MacGuire" and "Rainman." He's no more impressive than Julianne Moore, and Moore's quite impressive. For my money, the best performance rests either with Walters or Phillip Baker Hall. Until his turn here, Hall has always seemed a bit too arch (like his library detective on a "Seinfeld" episode). Even "Hard Eight" doesn't let him show the character's vulnerable side as he is allowed to in "Magnolia."As for Walters, if nothing else she should certainly have etched her name into the consciousness of a casting agent or two with a performance that manages to be brittle, hard and very endearing. Similar to the character she played in "Boogie," porn neophyte Jessie St. James, here she adds an edginess to what could have been a standard lost waif role. When added to the others, it makes it very hard not to recommend this film. But Anderson never really goes anywhere with his One Day In The Valley story that seems to be more than inspired by "Short Cuts." Unlike the end of "Boogie Nights" that finds Dirk Diggler returning to his "family" having learned some hard lessons about his place in life, it's hard to draw any such points from "Magnolia," although the events of the last half hour are loopy enough to almost forgive that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine, if heavily misunderstood film, with the most profound subtext of any movie I've seen recently. To sum the story briefly, Magnolia is director/screenwriter P. T. Anderson's attempt to adapt the songs of Aimee Mann to the screen through an extended metaphor of Exodus 8:2. Sounds ridiculous I know, but it works extremely, and surprisingly, well. This is the best combination of contemporary music and film I've seen (I haven't seen The Graduate, so I can't compare the two).In fact, a large part of the reason Magnolia works as well as it does is the almost constant presence of background music; it enhances the emotional effect of Anderson's story greatly. And this is a quality ensemble cast, too.But be warned, Magnolia isn't for everyone as it requires great patience for its payoff, which is highly symbolic. Furthermore, it is extremely vulgar and may offend some (several other IMDB users have indicated this very fact).And I do have a couple complaints about the film, myself. First, the opening sequence, while interesting by itself, doesn't seem to fit the context of the movie as it foreshadows a different type of ending from that which we get. Secondly, I think a couple of the characters could of received a little more attention than they did (even in a movie of this length). But, with Magnolia, these are minor quibbles. Definitely one of the better movies of 1999. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most people, Magnolia is like sauerkraut -- you either love it, or you despise it. When I saw this movie for the first time I was torn for the same reasons as everyone else -- good, but too long and too much. But after reflecting on the film, I feel have a better understanding on the whole picture. This movie is a masterpiece with one major problem - It is not cohesive. Magnolia's lack of unity separates it from other classic films that have the same interwoven character plots like "Pulp Fiction" and "Nashville." But this film does, however, have a great "feel." The acting was great, and the cinematography was innovative and truly breath taking -- not obnoxious.This film is NOT perfect, but it SHOULD be seen by everyone. Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius, along with Wes Anderson, I believe he will lead the next generation of filmmakers to great things. Once Anderson stops writing parts for actors (ie. Bill Macy) and starts being true to the basic idea of the script, he will truly produce the "Great American Film."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restored my faith in American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot for a film to affect me in any way. Previously, the only film to truly grasp me and violently shake me awake to the harsh and brutal reality of human nature was "Clockwork Orange," and possibly "Amadeus." What truly summed up the brilliance of "Magnolia" for me was when the final scene abruptly ended and my friend who attended the movie with me turned to me, eyes widened, and said, "Oh, my God."This movie is a complete masterpiece from beginning to end. It is the most satisfying saga of associations between people and interpersonal relationships, to say nothing of Paul Thomas Anderson's genius cinematography. Visually, this is the most stunning film I have ever seen. The uses of color and the absolutely brilliant lighting (like Tom Cruise's first scene in the movie, the bright light drowning out his facial features and exposing him completely, foreshadowing how he will be exposed later in the film) is INCREDIBLE.This is the most thought-provoking, beautiful, and intelligent movies I have ever seen. What is the most impressive is that it is almost effortless: every time there is a flicker of genius, it doesn't seem pretentious or intentional; it flows so smoothly that I was in awe of every second.The acting is completely incredible. Every single person in this film fits their role perfectly. There is not a frivolous moment; no wasted dialogue at all. An author once commented that J.D. Salinger loved his characters "more than God does," which can certainly be said about everyone in this movie. The characters are embraced so wholly that this is a surprisingly smooth three-hour long movie.This is an emotional workout: if it seems too long, then it is because it requires a lot of thought to involve yourself in this movie. I didn't hear anyone complain about "Titanic" and I believe it was longer than "Magnolia." Now why the hell did "Sixth Sense" get nominated for best picture</fullReview>

The brilliant, uncompromising script, the solid ensemble acting, the luminous cinematography are the hallmarks of the great Swedish director that Anderson has made his own.

Although there were an abundance of characters, all of them were basically flat... a single motivation, a single problem. Additionally, the very beginning of the movie sets us up for an ending which just doesn't come through.Converging storylines is a difficult feat to pull off. Although Anderson does a decent job, it is nothing new, and his work falls well short of other previous attempts such as Robert Altman's Short Cuts. Even so, I'm glad I saw this movie, and Cruise definitely deserves the Oscar Nomination for his role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I took a risk by deciding to watch a 10:30 showing of this 3-hour+ film only to come out of the theater well past 1:00AM wide-awake and marvelously unsettled. We talked about this movie til 4:30AM. This film rocked my world. P.T. Anderson drove his actors to an emotional edge that few films ever allow. His characters were so dynamic that despite the long run-time, the film maintained a dramatic tension that ran the entire length of the film.I have to say that this is one of the best thematically written screenplays in a long, long time, and Anderson's execution could not have been better. Pitting "adults" against "children" on a nationally televised game show (at a time when people are flocking to the quiz show revival in real life) thoughtfully addresses a sad truth in modern society - children are completely marginalized by adults. This same marginalization extends to the whole of humanity, and the film makes us question, "Who are the bad guys?" Can the bad guys really be the good guys, or are any of us really the good guys?Generations of dysfunction have crept into the collective unconscious to produce an entire society of psychologically damaged people. The depth of this film rivals even "American Beauty" in its thematic portrayal of society's misguided but misunderstood bourgeoisie. Anderson brilliantly brings this to a boiling point - aided by a haunting soundtrack powered by Aimee Mann - through the most clever and disturbing deus ex machina in recent memory.I'm seeing this film multiple times. I'm sure I'll catch more subtext on a second viewing, but I am forever changed for having experiencing the beauty of Magnolia.</fullReview>

Not the individual shots or anything nit-picky like that, but the overall picture.I found myself shifting uncomfortably in my seat. I got extremely restless about half way through.

It was just too long because there were some scenes so terrible that they should have been edited out of the movie and burned. I liked the movie. I thought that there were more good scenes than bad. Tom Cruise's scenes (until he started to cry, then it hit bottom) were great, and John Reilly's cop was an amazing character. The game show scenes were also very well done. But the scene where Phillip Seymour Hoffman starts talking about how "this is the scene in the movie where you help me" was ridiculously awful. The group song did not function well on any level. There were also scenes that were utterly unconnected to anything else. What was the point of the little kid's rap about who killed that guy if no one for the rest of the movie will care about who killed him? In short, the movie would not have been too long had he replaced all the bad scenes with less bad scenes, because, as I said, I was not bored at any time. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating movie for those who know how to enjoy a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a fascinating movie that not only tells a wonderful story but also takes the time to tell it well. A story that is not only a pleasure to watch but also one that requires a true love for art! I have read many of the reviews and I am always amazed at the few critics who take the time to make a comment on a film when it is obvious they do not enjoy watching movies. I sat in a theater for a little over three hours watching a film that was mentally stimulating, fun to watch, beautifully acted and well directed. For those who left the theater early, felt it was too abrasive in language or too long need to seriously re-evaluate their reason for watching movies in the first place. Just as Magnolia did, movies are created to take the viewer to another place. A place that allows you to escape into a world that is not your own. You as a viewer must allow this journey to take place by not over analysing it as the story is being told. Allow your mind to take in all of the visual and audible aspects the movie has to offer without trying to figure out who the killer is, who stole the money, who you like or don't like. Wait untill you have left the theater to put everything together and create your summation. I feel it necessary to say this because it is quite apparent that those who wrote unfavorable reviews about Magnolia or any film like it (American Beauty or Meet Joe Black) didn't watch the movie. Instead they critiqued and analised a film while still supposedly viewing it in a theater. Because of this they missed the story that was being told, missed the beauty of the film., all the while creating a miserable movie going experience. Magnolia gave me a wonderful insight into a group of characters lives that kept me in total awe. I have nothing but praise for all of the people that worked on this film. As for those who did not like the movie, I suggest you watch it again for what it is supposed to be(entertainment)- not as if you are watching it because you have a high school book report due on it or because you were dragged there by your girl/boy friend. Take my advice and you will stop feeling as though you wasted $7.00 every time you see a movie not staring Arnold Swarzennegger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what do other people want to see?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>why is it when a movie that has substance, message, and life comes along, all people can do is complain? is everyone who thinks this movie was bad so secluded in their little huts that they cant take to a movie that is worth seeing? gee, i wish adam sandler had a new movie coming out this week. or maybe carrot top will team up with pauly shore and make a slasher movie!!seriously, what do people like if they dont like this?it could be intelligence. this is a movie that is worth seeing a few times. there is a lot going on here. first of all, there are nine characters that are integral parts of the story. plus, each character encounters one another. thus 3 hours. sure its long, but you get to know the people. you understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. anderson is lucky to have squeezed all he wanted into a 3 hour movie. you could make a 2 hour movie about each of the characters, but that would be just ridiculous now, wouldnt it?the script is one of the best of the year by far. so theres swearing. who doesnt hear some of that every day? who hated pulp fiction? hmmmm? exactly. the parts arent stereotypical characters taken from other things, theyre original. a sexist infomercial host? a loving at-home male nurse? a druggie born again loving wife? you have seen people like this before? where?anderson molds a perfect script and superb acting to create one of the best films that this decade will see, and one that the last decade wishes it had seen.and yeah, biblical references can make a movie great, and they help make this one even greater.so stop complaining and wait for freddie prinze jr. to make a new one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best ensemble piece, almost ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so proud to have seen this movie. I am a lover of films, but I have never felt this proud of a movie and its director for achieving so much. Proud is the only word that comes to mind. PT Anderson is way ahead of his game as an artist and a filmmaker. Magnolia is a work of art.We've seen Pulp Fiction and we've seen Go and many other wonderfully creative films that intertwine the lives of a long list of characters, but none of them do it as unexpectedly and subtly as Magnolia. With as many as nine main characters, each exhausted with the pain they experience in their lives, the film unfolds beautifully in its strange form of storytelling, also avoiding the cliches of "we are all depressed people" movies.I must also add that what I look for most in films of such buzz is good acting. I was overwhelmed by the performances in this film. The standouts are Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore, both of whom deserve oscars, but the rest of the cast was also amazing. Also perfect dramatic subtlety in the music, wonderful lines, and some twisted scenes. Lovers of film NEED to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much more to offer than the average movie. And the acting is superb. I think it's clear that Anderson is an actors' director. But this has a downside too. For my taste, there were one or two many scenes displaying intense emotion. And Anderson, as a writer, seems to bend over backward to avoid on-the-nose dialogue.But the theme (repeated, I think, three times)-- You can let go of the past, but the past won't let go of you -- does come though.Those who liked SHORT CUTS will also like MAGNOLIA. (BTW, shouldn't we at lease see the street sign that explains the title? Maybe I missed it) Like SHORT CUTS, we have interconnected stories. And yes, I note that Earl Partridge was the originator of the kids quiz show. But that mention in rolling credits doesn't exactly tie things together.Basically, MAGNOLIA is a morality tale. And one worth seeing. I plan to rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all , I want to say I am a fan of P.T.Anderson from Boogie Nights.Secondly I want to say that I loved most of the actors and actresses that were in both movies.So maybe I am somewhat biased.But I thought the movie was very creative and reminded me of a good piece of literature that was assigned in college.The viewer has to make his/her own assumptions about what the movie was all about.To the naysayers, I say ,whats wrong with a little creativity and a little imagination? I will admit however, that some of the film could have been edited down.Some of it is kind of cheesy,but it still makes you think.Ie ...The scene where all the characters sing along to the song.....It doesnt seem to fit and it is quite pretentious..but it is unique and it is very daring. The other aspect of the movie that was excellant was the acting.Tom Cruise,Juliette Moore,Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall( ? ) give outstanding performances.William H Macy is his usual manic self and Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a very convincing job as the nurse.I give the movie a nine out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well written epic of human emotions and conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of the best films to emerge from 1999. Paul Thomas Anderson once again proves how gifted he is at being an adept storyteller. "Magnolia" is the story of a cop, a dying game show host, a dying man and his trophy wife, a self made guru, a coke addict, a male nurse, a washed up genius, and a kid prodigy all of them facing a conflict. "Magnolia" is a three hour epic that tells the story of these unfortunate souls in the San Fernando Valley. Each of them with a dark secret or desire that is eating them from within. Not only is Tom Cruise oscar worthy but the entire cast as well. The performances are first rate from a movie that doesn't waste anytime on it's characters. Anderson regulars Hoffman, Hall, Moore, Reilly, and Macy deliver powerful performances. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, Audacious and Uneven - Why You Shouldn't Miss It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with the Old Testament is all that original sin business. In Genesis, we find the roots of the philosophical view that human beings are born to be bad. We just can't help it. But that's not the half of it. Our real troubles come after we've committed our inevitable sins, and we must live with the anguish and regret. We wander the planet for the remainder of our days, seeking both redemption and punishment for what we've done.Such is the state of every character in Magnolia, and that's why a lot of folks aren't going to like it. Anderson dares to take us to the places we'd prefer to keep hidden below the veneers we see in the mirror, and he rubs our noses in the stuff from which we have been hiding. What makes this movie such an astonishing achievement is that he actually dares to do it; unabashedly, unashamedly, and with an audacity that would cause Andy Kauffman to stand up and take notice. It isn't so amazing that he fails, but that he comes so damned close, given the ambition.Anderson is telling us that our regret is what holds humanity together. It's the one thing that links all of us, and it rains down upon us like, like... well, see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my thoughts on the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have been very articulate in sharing their opinions re: the movie. In adding my 2 cents, I thought it was a very thought provoking movie, one of the best I have seen in ages.The movie interweaves many issues, making it difficult to make sense of it at first glance. Exodus 8:2 has been mentioned - where God's people are being held captive by Pharoah and God is raining down plagues on the Egyptians as a consequence of their refusal to release their captives.In the movie, a main point seems to be how some individuals like the 2 older men (as an example) hold others emotionally captive. The point may even be how parents can scar their children, putting them in emotional bondage. The behaviors such as obsession with drugs or sex were possibly part of this. The characters seemed to be trying to free themselves of this bondage in several ways, with the only successful way seeming to be confrontation, as moses did with pharoah. Plagues of cancer and frogs fell on the pharoah types - people can't escape their crimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the movie knowing NOTHING about it. Not even that it was by the same director as Boogie Nights. When I found that out, I could see some superficial similarities, most notably the stable of almost a dozen actors who appeared in both films. But the similarities basically stop there. Boogie Nights, to me, was fun but forgettable, while I was blown away by Magnolia. Of course, I didn't fully understand it from my first viewing, and I may not anytime soon, which is the mark of many great films (Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are Dead, Eraserhead, Lost Highway) and. admittedly, many bad ones (Mission: Impossible comes to mind). Just the sheer power of the characters and the imagery, the frantic pace of the plot, and the startling absurdity of one image (those who have seen it will know instantly what I mean) are enough to leave me satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I really say???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading all the comments made by others who have seen this artistic piece of work called Magnolia. Everyone opinions differ and that's a good thing. We can only take from a movie what we get. So don't fret if everyone doesn't have the same view point as you.For me? Well, I'm still trying to figure lots of things out. However, I can say that the film is excellent in that it's different. I'm a big fan of PT Anderson because of the way he tells a stroy, unlike anyone else. I'm not going to sit here and brag to you how intellectually sound this film is or go off on tangents about how it being a masterpiece unlike anything I've ever seen because I don't know that yet. But I find the film fascinating just because I know it's telling a message and it has a theme. What that message and theme is, I really don't know, but it's real, truthful, and unquestionable. Overall, it's a reprensentation of life as either I see it, you see it, or PT Anderson sees it. And that, to me, is what matters the most. All life really is is different people, different stories, different experiences, different goals, and different feelings. And as we travel the road of life, sooner or later, we come to realize that we are not so different after all. And in the end, when it's usually too late, we realize love is all we really need. If you think back to all of the relevant characters in the film, what was the one issue each one had with themselves? Issues of love! With it, we all have something in common, without it, we are all different, lonely idividuals looking up for an explanation when things fall down.Congratulations to the cast of this thought-provoking film. This three-hour plus film would not have been bearable with anyone else. Cruise and Macy made me sit up in my seat with their flawless performances. And of course who could go wrong with Moore? Her work is becoming revolutionary of our time.And most important...PT Anderson, who scares me with his brillance. You are right on the mark!And that's what I got out of the film. And it's not a matter of me being correct, because it's what I feel, not what I know. Try to remember that the next time you see a film. Until then...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but needs more discipline and editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Boogie Nights and Hard Eight, but MAGNOLIA has the feel of a picture whose director doesn't know when to quit. the first ten minutes of this picture seemed like previews for a movie I didn't get to see. Just about everything that worked well in boogie nights -- the large cast, multi-faceted story line, etc. -- worked far less successfully here. This is one of the few pictures I can think of (REDS was another one) where the whole movie would have been improved greatly by removing about 25% from virtually every scene, and removing some of the scenes altogether. For one -- THAT DAMN LIP-SYNCING SCENE. Other than that, I'm not sure. I ENJOYED the scenes with Wm Macy and Henry Gibson, and I can see why PT was loathe to cut them out of the film, but that's why you get the big bucks as the director/producer. In any case, this film is still far superior to, say, 1941, or Heaven's Gate, or Scarface, or any number of other movies where the director got a little undisciplined. PT's a real talent, and I look forward to his next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I've seen American Beauty, Malkovich, and some of the other best of the year. Magnolia is just a great film in a year that brought us a new generation of filmmaking. OK, it was probably a bit long, but how come nobody whined about that when it took an hour to sink Leonardo DiCaprio? Seriously, though, I am a huge Aimee Mann fan who went to the movie mainly to hear her songs and know that someone else actually likes her music. And this is some of the best music she has ever done. Buy the soundtrack and listen to Wise Up a few times. It's one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard.***NOW FOR A SPOILER***** I mention this because I didn't see it earlier. Did anyone notice that as the credits to What Do Kids Know roll, you see that it's an Earl Patridge production? Thus tying him to Jimmy Gator, and thusly, the entire story together. For those looking for something that ties the whole thing together there it is. All the relationships come from that.By the way, for those who like Magnolia and complicated stories, rent Playing By Heart. Multi-layered story but not quite as good as Magnolia. It's worth a watch if you are looking for a similar film.</fullReview>

I'd say many more will agree before long. Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Hard Eight all venture to declare human connections deeper and farther than most of us care to look. Anderson loves his actors and they respond by performing their best- enjoying the task of making these pictures bracing, intense, and hilarious. It's hard to say which of the three is best, but Magnolia is very important, and it features some of the best child actors I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOADS OF SPOILERS!!Hey, first off: read my first comment "I have some real news that will enlighten you" first, because this is merely supplementary material of what I have discovered upon second viewing of the film and browsing the internet.Notice that Earl's wife's name is Lilly, Jimmy's wife is named Rose, bit flowers, just like Magnolia (which was the name of the intersection's street, for those who didn't notice).Notice the less noticeable references to (Exodus) 8:2 or "82":-Jim's dating phonebox number is 82 -the blackjack dealer provides an 8 instead of a 2 -when the rain stops a busstop lights up reading Exodus 8:2 (I didn't see this, but heard about it) -82 is the number on the firefighter's plane -82 is part of the phone number (this might seem far-fetched, but isn't my own finding either) -When the kid jumps from the roof in the beginning we see a rope spelling 8:2Notice that the black rapping kid said that he is a prophet (always the last people to be listened to until 'tis too late)The frog-fall give the people something (a problem?) new to concentrate on and make them forget their own worries. Look at how Mackey visits his stepmother, and how he hates women because his mom died on him when he was just 14 (although my buddy says that this is not true, that there is no reason why he hates women--IT JUST HAPPENED (as the theme of the film is))Why does Donnie feel it is righteous to steal the money from his boss? Because he wants braces? no... because his parents stole from him, and this is his chance to get back at them!Jim Kurring speaks of a "twenty-four hour job", used as a metaphor for being a parent or just a cop?Also, I am beginning to doubt this fact: DID Jimmy die or DID he NOT? Did the frog just trigger the gun, shooting him, or stop him from shooting himself? Help.</fullReview>

Andersen's kaleidoscopic narrative, so involved with his characters, so moved by the seemingly off-handed novelistic sophistication belied by the film's naturalism. The film's structure is beguilingly simple, taking an hour each to build, maintain, and denoue: its second hour is a breathtakingly sustained hour of unrelenting narrative suspense.

		<shortDescription>Divine Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A virtual remake of Robert Altman's ambitious but flawed "Short Cuts": same 3 hour running time, same general theme of interconnecting private lives of various Los Angelenos, ending with a similar (albeit far more effective) climactic jolt, yet executed in a completely different style, in a way, far more interesting and progressive than Altman's later work. Little doubt of P.T. Anderson's emergence as a major filmmaker of the new century, remains after seeing this film. If it wasn't already obvious in "Boogie Nights", the director treats his subjects as if they were characters in a sprawling epic of biblical proportions, in which his own role, quite literally is that of an omnipotent diety who can either answer their prayers, respond to their negative karma in an appropriately ironic manner, or simply demonstrate his power by launching a "plague" or two. And like the patriarchal, Judeo-Christian God , he deeply loves each and every one of his creations, even the most rotten ones, relishing in their troubles and pleas as if they were a collection of Jobs. The kind of self-indulgent, wrenching melodrama that continuously unfolds across "Magnolia's" reels, rarely appeared in American cinema since the days of Douglas Sirk. But make no mistake about it, this kind of intentional tearjerking is a polar opposite of typical Hollywood fluff. The screenplay may be overwhelming, and occasionally far-fetched, yet in essence it's brutally honest and heartfelt. When it comes to sheer humanism, even the bold "American Beauty" fades in comparison (after all, it was trying to make a social statement more than anything else), although the later was still better structured as a film. The wonderful cast is given plenty of intoxicating substances to spice up their acting, so for the most part, their emotional string-pulling is well justified. Tom Cruise, an outsider to the indie world, manages what may be his best performance as a walking defense mechanism (complete with references to his "Risky Business" period); while most of the others, just as good, are the director's favorite ensemble who had appeared in his previous movie (William H. Macy as a former child prodigy robbed of his quiz show winnings, and Julianne Moore as a repentant wife of a dying cancer victim). Imperfections aside, Anderson's maverick achievement defies the bitter cynicism that permeates so many of its thematic counterparts: it's not afraid to get under the character's skin, no matter how unsettling the results may seem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good actors; 4-6 subplots with common themes; long; over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting is uniformly good. Some scenes are memorably done. The themes presented are fairly true (although presented one-sided and incompletely). The movie is worth seeing for what it does give and enduring its length and arty or psychological pretentions.The film starts with a demonstration of an unusual coincidence that results in a person's death. This same scene also demonstrates the pain that parents can inflict on a child. And, as a further reminder, one of the Exodus references is to the general and universal: 'and the sins of the father shall be visited even unto the 3rd and 4th generations' while the other Exodus reference reminds us that extremely unexpected, unusual events do sometimes occur. The movie is composed of what are roughly 4 - 6 short stories (depending on how you count), some developed very little, some more. But the stories have two things in common: Foremost, pain that parents inflict on their children can be indelible. And also with that pain, the children may (a) continue to inflict that pain on themselves; or (b) love their parents despite the pain and/or (c) inflict pain on others. The second thing they have in common is that all of the characters ( we'll finally see) have some kind of thread in common, from acquaintance, shared common history, etc.The movie does a great job of showing the ambivalence that's felt whenever hurt and love are mixed, of portraying how people can be let down in trusting someone vital (like a parent). But it's almost completely silent &amp; blind to any redemption or any reasons for the love to be there in the first place, except from position (parent, spouse).If we go back to the movie's Exodus 34:7 (sins of the father) reference; why do these parents treat their kids so bad? We can see lots of examples of parents mistreating kids -- were they passing something on? -- why would they do such things? -- did they also endure a similar pain that they were trying to reduce in this way? As if by repeating it with their children they could say, "Ah, Father (or Mother), I must forgive you for the way you treated me because I, myself, have loved my child and also treated it badly." Ah, now that might have made a more significant movie (for me). At least it would be more psychologically interesting and complete, and also fit the Exodus reference. As for the pertinence of the other Exodus reference, it's used to justify a "_deus ex machina_" event which, if omitted, would have left the movie less dramatic, far flatter and less interesting (maybe "Titanic" without the iceberg?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTHey, I'm back again, expression my sarcastic feelings to the lame-o's and shallow-o's among us. So, I understand that some of you did not like Magnolia because a) it was weird; 2) it was long; c) the ending was more open than something that's opened really wide. Guess what? Of course it's weird, a reflection of every day life usually is (you'd probably think American Beauty was weird too). But if you can't understand that this film is a masterpiece because it gives the most realistic reflection/portrayal of life as we know it (long, and you never know what'll come next), well, I'm sorry, but then ya might as well die or something.What about the frogs? Oh yeah, bringin' up the frogs again, eh? Well, here's what i think: The surreal falling of frogs (+ gun) is merely a metafor, meant to symbolize--and in a way, mock--the narrator's "Just because things on TV seem weird to you, doesn't mean they don't happen". Another example of this was the fact that Phillip Baker Hall's character supposedly didn't remember abusing his daughter--just because you don't remember something, doesn't mean it didn't happen. because, as stated under a painting in the film, "But it DID happen". Speaking of paintings, did anyone notice the magnolia paintings in 1) Jimmy's house and 2) behind the pilot's head when he shoots himself in one of the first scenes?Notice that at the gameshow, someone holds up a sign saying "exodus 8:2", which is taken away by a stagehand. (Exodus 8:2--And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs).Notice the resemblance between Jimmy Gator and Earl Partridge: Both are estranged from their children. Both are suffering from cancer. Both have cheated on their wives. Both die when the frogs fall. (symbol: the TV--cause of everyone's suffering, or a medium at least--is shot, ending all the bad with the mens' deaths).Notice how Stanley asks about the weather station to someone on the show.Notice how the black kid raps about how the Worm (his brother, the black woman's son?) comitted the murder. And how he sais something about the love of god sending forth a vengeancefrom the sky or something similar.What do the flashcards on the show say on the back? OUR KIDS (...) US did anyone catch the blank?Notice how Mackey speaks of what society has done to little boys. This referring of course to the killing of innocence.And which book was it that spoke of the past not being done with us?Brilliant cinematography, music and direction bring out the best in the ensemble cast. Cruise was great, but no better than the rest--an oscar for him? Give one to the rest too, after all, the only reason they choose to nominate him is because he's made name already. Hall was great again, Reilly is just a big fluffy puppy, Moore is a genius, Blackman gave a helluva breakthrough performance (even better than that Osmond kid), Macy is the biggest loser ever (that's a compliment) and the ever so sensitive and to me most teardrawing Hoffman gives a superb performance opposite Moore and the master Robards. Now if I hear one more person tell me it was weird, I'll suggest they look around--now there's weird for ya.ps: notice how people constantly say that it's raining cats and dogs... or was it cats and frogs?</fullReview>

I kept expecting that it would be like the movie "Go" or like "Jackie Brown", and in the end all the characters will end up meeting like at the end of "Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World", and have big hilarious ending. Only when Tom Cruise's character was confronted by his past, and the way color disappears from his face, did I realize it was going to be about something darker. Paul Thomas Anderson should be congratulated and rewarded wholeheartedly for approaching human nature in sort of comical and spiritual point of view. Just the fact that he was able to present "No Plot" in a way where it seemed like as if it was a great complex plot, is worthy of the applause. I say "No Plot" because the objective of the movie is to put a mirror in front of each character about their life, and it not any particular series of events that causes that, but just regular incidents that occur in life. The trick was to get each character in different physical location to open the closet door at one single point in time, that made the movie work.All the actors did tremendous job. The music was not particularly moving or interesting. I think it would have helped movie become instant classic, if it had memorable moving theme, that enhanced tremendous characters that PTA created.Having said all that I still have complains. I think PTA took way too much time to setup unfolding of the plot. I think the characters he created were so tremendous, that you did not need to see them for too long to figure out what they were all about. I think he took longer than it was needed to set those characters up, and could have saved half hour and keep the audience from dozing off.I also think that even though the director took us on a journey to deepest valleys in human heart, and undressed human nature, for some reason he did not believe bringing tears to audience's eyes was necessary. I didn't see anyone wiping their cheeks or blowing there nose in theater. I think if he had done that, then that would also help this movie succeed like "Green Mile". I think when a director asks us to make emotional investment, we deserve to be brought to tears. I loved the ending of the movie, and specially on the positive note that it ended. How the characters just seemed to accept raining toads as natural phenomenon was just a moving and masterful touch!In summary, a little less time to set up characters, a better musical score, and just a bit more focus on bringing out the emotions in the audience would have made this one of the most excellent movies ever made.The great achievement of this movie is that, although it may not get you to feel much, but it will definitely get you thinking, about opening and cleaning your own closet!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As dazzling, stunning piece of creative art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is daring film about fate. The first ten minutes of the film is narrated by Ricky Jay, showing a few urban legends of coincidence and fate, and telling us that strange things do happen. It sets the scene for a shocking display of coincidence, interwoven stories, and perhaps the meaning of life itself. Some of these things are hidden, and Magnolia is not a film that allows its viewers to sit back and relax. It's intense, involving, and requires you to abandon your inhibitions and prepare for the twisted reality that is Magnolia.Everything it does, it does flawlessly, and with a spark of revolutionary creativity. Sometimes disturbing, sometimes shockingly funny, sometimes scary, sometimes emotional - always intense. This will be regarded as a classic, perhaps even a twistedly brave cult classic, in years to come.Paul Thomas Anderson, acclaimed director of Boogie Nights, brings us Magnolia, a film of infinite creativity. It is truly one of the greatest masterpieces ever to richly emerge from the silver screen. Magnolia is a revolution in cinematography; the camera moves as you never thought possible. It's an artistically thrilling, electrifying vision. The artwork always fits with the scene and allows other elements to finish setting the mood. The acting is perfect. If this really happened, the real people couldn't have acted it any better. A team of about a dozen of P.T. Anderson's favorite actors play the roles of unusual, yet not so unusual people. It captures so much by telling the simultaneous storiesof 12 different people. In essence, there are many plots, but one story. It is a story of fate and coincidence.The music is a pulsing background that fits perfectly, and captures the emotions, especially in the most intense moments. Aimee Mann's inspiring songs weave together some of the film's most important scenes. In the technical category, this film is absolutely stunning. Everything from the sound to the special effects (provided by George Lucas' ILM) is perfect. The editing is poignant in itself; many scenes never cut for about ten minutes, just to make it seem longer.Magnolia is a social analytical masterpiece. It touches on every aspect of society and life itself, but is mostly about the uncontrollable element of fate in everyone's life. We are told that it is pointless to plan our lives out like we actually have any control over them. It pushes the bounds of reality. Through the course of the movie, it will change what you accept as reality, and it will make you believe unfeasible things. When the movie is over you will realize you have been tricked, and you will still fully accept Magnolia's version of reality only as it exists in the movie. However, it is easily realized that everything in this movie has either happened, or could happen - even the movie's most well-known, yet unspeakable scene. It is a movie about coincidences, fate, life, and different kinds of people. The characters portray most of the different varieties of people that exist in the world; some good, most bad.There is a certain scene in this movie that is unexpected, to say the least. People that have seen the movie understand. This scene has been the breaking point of many Magnolia viewers, even critics. Their ideals of normal film-making have been shattered. They break down and abandon the film as a whole. This happens and will continue to happen to people that see this movie. Why? Their perception of film itself has been stained by the monotone flow of "normal movies," as I call them. They are ill with the expectancy that all movies should be predictable, even in the slightest. This inmfamous "scene" from Magnolia is so unexpected that it crushes the traditional movie viewer into a confused pile of disitengrated expectations. For the more open minded, it provides a thrill of extreme proportions. It makes you believe it. What happens in "the scene" has actually happened, and there is a book on Stanley's table (the boy genious) that explains it. Magnolia is richly crafted before this point, and "the scene" adds even more.This is an intense, flawless masterpiece not only of cinema, but of art. Strong words for a strong movie, one of the best films ever to throw itself in your face. It's completely involving in its sublime storytelling, flawless elements, and flowing creativity.4starCritic.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia Is The Most Irritating Film I've Seen In Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of those films that you either like or hate. I feel the later best describes this trash. For starters, the music is so loud and continuous that you simply can not pick up on the dialog. The story rambles, switching from one depressing scene to another and back again. Between the music blaring and the characters screaming, I absolutely couldn't take anymore and my wife and I walked out. What ever prompted great actors like William H. Macy, Jason Robards and Tom Cruise to accept roles in this tripe? Having said all of this, I'm perfectly aware that Magnolia will probably win best picture next year. Go figure????</fullReview>

Along with this, the people who were left behind, laughing because the people who left just "couldn't take it". I loved Boogie Nights, have no problem with "symbolic meaning", but raining frogs? Yes, in the bible (Exodus 8:2) it mentions frogs, but give me a break. Should this movie last another week in the theatres, I will be amazed. Notting Hill lasted, which up until I saw this waste of time, I thought was a complete waste. Save your money &amp; 3 hours of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The friend I saw this film with afterwards, when I asked her if she liked it, said "I didn't like it, but I thought it was good."It's a trip led by an overly-caffeinated auteur who is completely on the top of his game. Whether or not you want to take the trip with him depends on what you bring to the table with your own taste and personal histories.In fact, personal histories is what this film is all about. It's a grand guignol soap opera, the interweaving storylines and intersecting characters, the dying patriarchs and the drug abuse and marital infidelity. But it's all self-reflexive. At one point, the old man's nurse ( ) tells a phone operator, "This is like one of those scenes in a movie where the dying old man makes his last request to see his son. But it's real." Except it isn't.There's so much going on in this film that it seems obviously written by a former film student, someone who knows how critics like symbolism and layers. It's destined for cult status. Every scene packs some sort of dramatic wallop. Like it or not, this film attempts something very few other American films have: it lets the scenes go on until a character says their piece and reveals a little bit more of who they are. It's bravely not in a rush.I can criticize a lot of little things - which enervate the people who dislike this film - but they for me are overshadowed by what it attempts and what it accomplishes. Just as with "Boogie Nights" the film's too long. Anderson seems so sure that every thing he puts up there will be interesting to everyone else without bothering to rethink it. It's like a bloated novel by a brilliant writer (like, say Don DeLillo's "Underworld"), wherein you want to skip over certain parts where the writer gets carried away with their own brilliance and the depth and breadth of what they are attempting. The film could also be criticized for falling prey to what I call "Spike Lee Syndrome" - incessant use of the music soundtrack overlayed over long sequences to string them together; here sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's as if the filmmaker is insecure about the ability of their dialogue to carry a scene or sequence, but music can drown out and then blunt much of the emotional impact. The film could also benefit from more humor - there's some, coming naturally from the human situations and dark comedy moments - but not enough to give the audience a breather for such long emotional stretches.And yet this is still an astonishing piece of work. To weave so many lives together, to bring together such an amazing cast and illicit a string of superb performances, is not an easy task, and, in this day and age, it's a rare Hollywood film that actually is about something. To criticize the film for not having enough plot seems narrowminded, ie, revealing how much people have become accustomed to the "Plot Point every 5 minutes" film structure. This film is highly structured, it's rarely boring, and at the end it reaches a catharsis, an epiphany even (replete with Biblical imagery, either laughable or mind-blowing depending on your point of view, but undeniably a major surprise - an event, which by the way, really did happen). Particularly outstanding are Jason Robards, in that most thankless of roles, stuck on a deathbed for the entirety of the film; he nonetheless brings to it an enormous amount of pathos. Phillip Baker Hall (the gameshow host) and John Reilly (the cop), who have both been in Anderson's two other films, are also excellent. Reilly's may in fact be one of the most realistic and humanistic portrayals of a police officer in film history. Tom Cruise, the misogynistic male empowerment guru, is quite remarkable (although some cynics would merely say he's playing himself) - although it's hard to watch all of his scenes preaching to the whooping throngs of males awaiting advice on how to bag babes. (What's scary is it isn't all that farfetched to imagine this really happening.) The child actors are frighteningly good (particularly the lead child prodigy boy). Although the women are excellent I still get the feeling that Anderson is less comfortable developing and understanding female characters. (Here at least, he has a wonderful African American TV interviewer, a woman who cuts through the Cruise's BS with acute sharpness.)Although Anderson's direction is occasionally too overexuberant, overall it's beautifully filmed and orchestrated, from the lighting and composition right down to the small background touches (the artwork on the walls, the furniture, the background players even). The recurring themes and symbols make this a film to go back and watch a second time (when you have another three hours to kill, of course). Especially big is the theme of power, inherent in each scene, wherein one character has power over the other, forcing them to sit down, to be quiet, to listen. It's a thought-provoking film, open to debate and interpretation, full of life (and death), of black comedy, and in the hands of a less-ambitious director the same film could easily have been reduced to a MOW (which, one of the child prodigies in the film criticizes another for not knowing , means "Movie of the Week"). Criticizing it for not being more short and sweet, like a typical movie, is to forget that it's not a movie at all, but a Film with a capital "F" - and all the pretensions which go along with that. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky made films unlike any other, sometimes entertaining but more often difficult and philosophical. Anderson's no Tarkovsky, but he may be as close as (mainstream) Hollywood will allow themselves to get. And if people don't want to sit through "Magnolia" there's always the James Bond film playing next door. Just remember: there's room for all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well-let me tell you-I didn't want to see this movie but because I had a few hours to kill and it was the only film starting at the appropriate time...I saw it! I went into this film expecting 'not much' and what I got was exactly the opposite. I can understand why some people wouldn't like it-hey, we all have different takes on things. However-I loved it. Yes-the language was a little excessive-if you have delicate ears this one's a no-no.I never saw 'Boogie Nights' so I can't compare the two but if it was anything like 'Magnolia' I have to see it! The acting was stunning. I was particularly impressed with Julianne Moore's performance. She brought her character across masterfully. Tom Cruise was also breathtaking. I didn't like his character but the acting was superb. In my opinion-I don't think we are supposed to like him. I found 'Magnolia' to touch every sense in my body. It made me angry, it made me sad, it made me laugh and it made me cry. All in all, it was quite simply terrific. If you loved 'American Beauty' you'll love 'Magnolia'. I highly recommend it. It may be 3 and a bit hours long but it is so completely riveting that you won't even notice the time. Just a suggestion-go to the washroom before you sit down-you aren't going to want to miss any of this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbelievably great film with an unbelievable ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is quite a flick. I cannot wait to see it again and again, to pick up all the things I missed the 1st time, just like I have done with Boogie Nights. PT Anderson is an original and groundbreaking film maker and it's no wonder his favorite actors keep showing up and coming through for him. This time, however, he gets to play with Tom Cruise and Jason Robards, and he, and they, deliver big time. Cruise, Robards, Phillip Baker Hall, John C Reilly, Julianne Moore and Melora Walters give my favorite performances here. I did not enjoy William H Macy's character/storyline or that of his younger game show whiz counterpart, unfortunately. Their stories aren't fully developed or resolved and I was waiting for Macy to explode and get violent, which didn't really happen. And, for some reason, Alfred Molina is terribly underused. I am sure Molina has scenes somewhere on the cutting room floor. I know PT Anderson had to cut a lot from this movie, I wish he would have cut most all of Macy's stuff and given us more Molina! You may remember Molina as the drug dealer who thwarts a robbery at his house in Boogie Nights, what a scene.The ending is another story, I think it was a bad choice, even if it is based on biblical/meteorological phenomenon. That kind of thing would never happen in LA, and I don't think you should have to run to the bible to understand a movie. My opinion....They tell you not to end movies this way if you study film making and screenwriting, but PT Anderson is groundbreaking and maybe that's how you get that way as a writer and director, by breaking the rules. There are many references to the ending as you wind through the movie, but it is so grotesquely humorous that I was taken out of the film's stories. I'd say half of the storylines go unresolved as a result of the ridiculous ending.However, the movie is almost 3 hours long and I'd say that 2 hours and 15 minutes of it are as good as films get. A must see no matter what I think or you think of the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You told me this was good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the opening was superb. Trouble is, each of the vignettes were far more worthy of a three hour film than what was actually shot. You'd think someone might have noticed that at some point.Not just the prelude, but the prologue was excellent too. Take heart, you'll be sitting in an uncomfortable chair on a sticky floor for a long time before the movie actually starts. But when it does, you will be so pumped, because everything is so good. The introduction of the characters is masterfully handled. You see short shots of each of them doing various things: dying, crying, snorting coke, whatever. You don't know who they are or why they do the things they do, but it gets you started in a very subtle and effective way. Now it's time to go to the bathroom, and while you're there you may as well just get back in your car and drive away. You won't miss much.The performances are great, mostly. The cop was desperately dull. I had no sympathy for him at all, and I didn't like him. Although, to be fair, that's not really the actor's fault. I never really connected with him either, and that is. Nor did I connect with the coke snorting girl at all. Macy was great but wasted. He should have been cut. Hoffman was great, as always. Moore and Cruise were fabbo, and the old guys were also very strong. The direction was strong as well. Excellent use of music. I love the effect of having background music playing over a scene that has music in it already. Splendidly done. Very disconcerting. It reminds you that you're in a movie, as does the script, in places ("This is the part of the movie where you help me."). The problem was the script. This was seven films condensed into one, and any one of the seven would have been more satisfying than the one. This film is less than the sum of its parts. The sum of its parts are amazing and awesome, but this film is flat and dull. As for the "originality" of the ending... I say "ha!" It wasn't original at all. It's the same device as Ang Lee used in "The Ice Storm". It brings together in a single experience of it all of the disparate characters. But it was better in "The Ice Storm" because it wasn't a gimmicky joke, and it actually advanced the plot. This movie should not be in contention for Best Picture. Best Director, sure, that's fine. But not Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, great characters, a few really hokey sequences, and waaaaaay too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a really interesting movie. People are going to love it, and people are going to hate it. I loved it and hated it.The Good Stuff:The cast (and casting) is fantastic, with stellar performances across the board. I particularly enjoyed the performances of Jeremy Blackman (Stanley Spector, Boy Genius) and John C. Reilly (Jim Kurring, Dorky Cop), although there isn't a weak performance to be found in the movie.The characters were all really enjoyable, albeit often slightly over the top, particularly "Frank T.J. Mackey" (Tom Cruise), "Phil" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and "Claudia Wilson" (Melora Walters).The incidental nature of the separate plots is interesting and the individual plots are often compelling. The centralization of the plots around "Earl Partridge" (Jason Robards) works well, and I particularly liked the use of the opening sequences to explain the nature of coincidence and make the entire movie seem more plausible.The Bad Stuff:Many people are going to tell you this film is directed incredibly well, which, in my opinion, is only partially true. There are a great many interesting sequences and film techniques used, many of which often work quite well. However, I found the overall nature of the direction to often be so heavy-handed with the use of bizarre camera movement that I think it somewhat detracted from the emotional content of the film. Granted, it doesn't compare to the all-time offender in this respect, Oliver Stone's directorial farce in "Natural Born Killers".There were a few sequences in the film that were so awkward and out of place that they seemed merely put in for bizarre effect. I refer particularly, of course, to the singing interlude with all the characters, and the rain of frogs. No one will ever convince me that these two ridiculous occurences enhanced this film.This movie is really just too long. As interesting as it was, I started to lose interest after the singing sequence. This is a particular problem because the pacing of the film starts out so intense and then continously slows as the film progresses. This is an interesting (and pretty effective) device, but it hurts in a 3 1/2 hour movie.I personally think some of the "Frank T.J. Mackey" character sequences and a lot of the interaction between "Claudia Wilson" and "Officer Jim Kurring" could have been removed to shorten this movie by about 45 minutes, and maintain interest throughout the film. And my god it would have been wonderful to remove that damn singing sequence.My Conclusion:Overall, "Magnolia" was a very interesting movie, but mostly just because it was filled with such wonderfully portrayed and wholely unique characters. I felt more like I was watching a set of virtuouso vignettes than an actual movie. While I thought the acting and casting were some of the best I've ever seen, in the end I didn't really like this movie as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier (and really great) work on "Boogie Nights".I gave it a solid 8. If you're easily put to sleep in a movie theater, skip it. And you may want to wait for videotape anyways, to give yourself some quite possibly needed pauses during a 3 1/2 hour long set of truly great audition reels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PT Anderson is gifted but too arrogant to edit himself. Which is a pity because this could have been a truly great film had he not been so self-indulgent. The first 2 hours are fantastic and then he doesn't know how to tie things up so he starts playing God and it's all downhill from there (the effects are spectacular,though). Another thing that works my last nerve is the preachiness, the moral grandstanding. He's too young to take himself so seriously. However, I admire his gumption and his uncompromised vision. Also, the acting is so good, that Tom Cruise gives the best performance of his life. He may finally become a good actor after this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is a Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is not a perfect film. Certain plot threads are left dangling, and maybe a few characters could have either been developed more complexly or eliminated. But how can you argue these points when the final result is such a stirring success? This is about as good a movie as you are going to get this year. There is no one out there in his generation with an eye for the cinema like Paul Thomas Anderson. He borrows from greats such as Scorcese, Demme, and Altman, but gives it all his own unique and brilliant spin. In one instance he is impressing you with fancy camera work, the next he simply sits the camera down and lets the actors do their thing (which they all do marvelously). I personally think that one of the best things going for Anderson as an upcoming director is that he clearly has a profound respect for his actors, and as a result he rings incredible performances out of all of them. Jason Robards is heart-wrenchingly realistic as a man dying of cancer, Melora Walters gives an excellent turn as a stressed out coke-head searching for stability and love, and John C. Reilly gives his usual excellent best as the cop who falls for her. While is may not be perfect, Magnolia is nevertheless an awe-inspiring, sweeping masterpiece about regret, forgiveness, and "the things that happen".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Break through the quirks and noise to get to life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to enjoy films more when they don't follow the ordinary scheme. Magnolia certainly is extraordinary but almost too much so. I like to leave a film with a strong understanding of what the writer and/or director wanted me to know. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced Anderson knew, himself. The characters are refreshingly multi-faceted, real-life people with depth, foul-mouths, and a generally apparent inability to realize their own faults. I absolutely loved the opening sequence and the premise it presented. I would have liked to hear more about those stories and people, though. The characters we spent 3 hours with ended up in the same old, ordinary blackholes we've grown accustomed to: incest, drugs, homosexuality. Aren't these just safety nets for writers who can't come up with anything else that might not be as shocking yet more true to life? Just a little frustrated, I guess, that Anderson didn't capitalize on the superb characters and story lines he began with. The climax never presented itself for anyone but Cruise's character, whose transformation got butchered in the edit room. So sorry. I'll still praise it for its groundbreaking directorial images and its efforts towards luscious characters. LOVED the clever elements used in the sound department that forced the audience to lean in and pay attention. Lots of metaphors hear on a 3-dimensional level. For this, kudos!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well p.t. anderson has created another sprawling picture set in the San Fernando valley. Unlike his previous "Boogie Nights" which was spilt into two totally different tones, (70's fun, free and full of possibilities and the 80's, which was payback time.) Magnolia follows many subplots in 24 hours that are connected visually only through a game show that seems everyone is watching. However emotionally everyone in the picture has seemed to reach one of the most important points in the're lives...all at the same time. Julianne Moore feels that killing herself is probably the most noble and unselfish thing she has ever done, and when some pharmacists try to mock her act with hints of possible unethical use of drugs she rightfully goes berzerk. What if the boy on the game show did get to the bathroom and never stood up to his father? I am sure that this boy never gave his father the resources to swindle him the way the Bill Macy character was when he was a "freak" back in 60's. What if Tom Cruise never went to see his father before he died or the J.C. Reilly character never went back to the "coke" womans apartment. The movie is very "a" leads to "b" which enables "c" and "d" to happen, and it is quite breathtaking to see it unfold on screen. What some viewers might not know is that we are (hopefully) falling back into another age of "directors" movies. I'm sure that people who went to see a p.t. anderson movie were astouded, while people who went to see it for Tom Cruise were perplexed (albeit not as perplexed as the Eyes Wide Shut masses) and wondered how somone suckered them into seeing a picture about ideas. Like the three intro stories that begin the film, with so many coincidences going on, something must give.(the awesome faux-conclusion). This "event" should not be over analyzed, it is just a symbol that represents the entire picture. Like the sing-along before it, the "event" is just to show how universal our experiences and emotions are. During the sing-along everyone was basically at one of the lowest points of their lives, while the "event" turned everyone's lives into chaos which made the characters show their true colors when it looked as though the world might just be ending. Magnolia is a piece of art, like a painting, and Mr. Anderson's painting is messy and not quite a masterpice but it helps me to answer the question of what is art? Art is something that moves you and sticks in your mind for longer than it should...and your not sure why. Like this years "American Beauty" and "Fight Club", I love a film that makes me think of things that I have never thought of before. I am not a better or worse person...just different. Isn't that what good art does, it grabs you and shakes you and dares you to open your eyes...and keep them open long after you have left the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a movie that in its length could have dragged and bored its point into the ground, but it didn't. It was brilliant in its complexity just as "American Beauty" was in its simplicity. I usually do not like Tom Cruise much but was impressed by his powerful and perfect performance. Every character shined. Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves more credit as an actor and the young boy should have been the Anakin in star wars. (If not him, Haley Joel Osment) People will say that the ending was non-sensical and meaningless, but anyone who was keen enough to catch not only the foreshadowing and the clear statement of the theme of coincidence at the beginning of the movie, should also look into its biblical significance. Oh, the only thing i was wondering, was that the police officer character talking to Jullianne Moore at the end of the movie? Listen to the things he has to say people, it makes things make a lot more sense. The guy who wrote this must have a brain the size of a watermelon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the movie is good, but still a little weird. This movie comes along near the end of the Oscar year, and of course, will have buzz surrounding it until and after the nominees are announced. The reason, if not because of a genuinely enjoyable film, is because of its strikingly original screenplay. 1999 Has undoubtably been a great year in moviemaking, and along with titles like Being John Malkovich, and American Beauty, this movie is definitely going to top critics' lists.Watching this movie reminded me of P.T. Anderson's most notable work to date, Boogie Nights, in lots of ways. The most obvious to me, while maybe not so to many others, is the incredibly long steadycam shot during the first quiz show scene. The camera follows (typically from behind) lots of different characters, as though the audience is strolling through the halls of the studio. Like the opening of Boogie Nights, this is just simple exposition, but is really slick and comfortable. And on aside from the actors (the cast is basically the same as Boogie Nights), the long, slightly relentless shots of high emotion are everywhere (Jack &amp; Earl for example), and while being almost too long (my attention almost drifts), the shots do make the viewer uncomfortable.The story (or stories) throughout this movie left me impressed, as although they all aren't connected, I found myself interested in all of them. Each time the focus shifted from one subplot to another, I found myself thinking 'o ya. I wanted to find out what was happening here'. Some might complain that so many stories lead to the 'tedious' three hour length, but I didn't even notice the length, because I found myself always interested in coming back to a story that was left hanging a few minutes prior.The ending of Magnolia will be forever talked about as being completely unique, and without giving too much away, it is reminiscent to 2001 in its cryptic style and context. This movie just impressed me from start to finish. Every time I leave a movie thinking "I don't get it," but still feel like I've been entertained, I feel like it was $8.50 well-spent.Go see this movie. You'll either like it, or completely hate it, there doesn't seem to be a happy medium with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich, complex and a mirror to ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a rich and complex story of several people living in the San Fernando Valley in modern-day California. Textured and insightful, the film comments on redemption, true love, forgiveness and second chances in a way few films have managed to do. PT Anderson has created vivid and interesting characters, full of frailties and doubts, and creates an interwoven story of a day in their lives. By the end of the film, each has learned something about themselves and about each other. With poignant music courtesy of singer/song writer Aimee Mann (of the 80's band Till Tuesday), Magnolia is a magnificient, touching and thought provoking film. Anderson has created a fascinating tapestry of these people's lives and the viewer can't help but be overtaken by their responses to life and to each other. Tom Cruise shines in this film, and showcases what he can do when given interesting material. Likewise for John C. Reilly who is completely believable as a good hearted cop looking for love. Indeed, all the actors shine in this ensemble piece.This film has many personal touches to it. Look for the numbers 8 and 2 throughout the film. I counted 28 instances when they were placed together as "82" in some background scene or another. The numbers refer to a Biblical passage in Exodus which underscores the climax of the film. (Note: If you are someone who will look up Exodus 8:2 before the film, don't. See the film, then look it up. It's more poignant and funny that way - trust me). Also, look for the magnolias scattered in various forms throughout the film, as well as the reason why the film is called Magnolia - the explanation is there, you just have to look for it.Magnolia is similar to American Beauty in that both are an examination of life, truth and redemption. Both are about ordinary people in ordinary circumstances and the interconnectedness of us all. Like American Beauty it is a mirror to us all, reminding us of the here and now and how precious and fleeting life is. Both films show us the beauty and ugliness of the human condition through the eyes of their characters. Both films challenge us to re-examine the relationships in our lives. Magnolia is touching without being overly sentimental and the narration at the end summarizes everything the story is about. Listen carefully to it because it reveals a lot of interesting thematic information. The film is bookened with short documentaries/commentaries on coincidence and random chance, and is again a comment on Magnolia's and Anderson's themes. This is a movie that needs and deserves to be watched more than once</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wise Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson would like to dazzle us with manic excess in the film, "Magnolia" but unfortunately, it is a prolonged (over three hours) exercise in misdirection. "Magnolia" tries to convince us that coincidences don't occur in life without an interdependency and that the present maladies are the direct result of the sins of our past. But the three areas where "Magnolia" tries to draw its strength are so contrived and excessive that it becomes self-defeating. It uses the quiz show, ?What Do The Kids Know', and the character, Stanley (played with deft seriousness by Jeremy Blackman), to accentuate the turmoil of child prodigies'; it redefines manliness with the character Frank T.J. Mackey (played a little over the top by Tom Cruise) and his assault in the battle of the sexes with the ?Seduce and Destroy' seminar; and finally it draws us into the languishing deathbed character, Earl Partridge (played well by Jason Robards Jr.) who has yet to make peace with what he did to his wife and son. Yet all three situations are so overdone that Anderson literally beats it to death. We are also treated to two off-the-wall scenes involving a singing song of lamentation and an act of providence that don't make much sense. There are, however, bright morsels interspersed in the film that almost make "Magnolia" palatable. The quirky relationship between Officer Jim (John Reilly) and Claudia (Melora Walters) is indeed refreshing. They don't seem to communicate on the same wavelengths (Jim is convinced Claudia is hiding domestic violence from him while Claudia is hoping Jim won't discover her cocaine habit and later Claudia is sure Jim won't love her because she hasn't been truthful while Jim thinks he is a disgrace because he lost his gun) and yet the one commonality they have is a desperate need to love. The other nugget is the troubled Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) and a great scene he has explaining why he wants braces as he tries to find salvation from loving a stud bartender. "Magnolia" is filled with other wonderful characterizations including Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, and Melinda Dillon and yet it remains a smorgasbord when it could have been a better defined meal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy effort that ultimately suffers for its own excess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is a big, often loud and commotion filled emotional jumble of a movie. That is not to say that it is a failure as a story or an entertainment. Quite the contrary in fact, for I found myself often mesmerized by the dizzying pace and imagery with which P.T. Anderson constantly bombards his audience. The length, at 3+ hours, flew by with only an occasional complaint from my backside. There are moments of great pain and revelation played with, at times, expert depth by a very fine cast that includes standout performances by Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Tom Cruise. Richard Elswit's camera work is rich with texture and sheen as we travel through either the money saturated or financially bereft homes and lives of a panorama of interrelated characters living in LA. The current of the story flows with the turbulence of an estuary, twisting in eddies of plot and character examination that turn back in on themselves several times, before leaving us, somewhat shaken, deposited on the silted shore of redemption.This movie travels in much the same territory as Robert Altman's 1993 masterpiece "Short Cuts". Both films examine the lives of a disparate group of Los Angelino's and the way that fate and a unifying natural disaster can ultimately link people in the strangest of ways (the event in "Short Cuts" was an earthquake. I won't reveal the event in this film, except to say that any Cajuns watching this movie might have to seriously reconsider their taste for frog's legs!). Yet what separates the two films, and keeps "Magnolia" from being cast in the same brilliant light as "Short Cuts" is the restraint that a much older (and perhaps wiser) Altman used in dealing with his sprawling cast (22 characters) and story. Anderson pulls out all the stops, right from the beginning of this movie, and never (not for a minute) lets up. In musical terms this movie plays as one big three-hour crescendo of visually arresting imagery and emotionally charged performances. There are no adagio's here; no quiet moments of reflection or subtle exposition. It's as if Anderson keeps playing the last three minutes of the "1812 Overture" over and over, without giving his audience or his actors a chance to catch their breath. The actors here try their best, and deliver some very rewarding (if somewhat too actor-ish) performances. . Julianne Moore is the formerly gold-digging wife of a dying television producer (Jason Robards) who now faces the grueling pangs of guilt as she watches her husband wither away from cancer. Tom Cruise plays the misogynistic, self-help guru son of said producer who, estranged from his father, channels his misguided rage into an empire built upon the degradation of women. William H. Macy is a former child prodigy who, having been robbed of his quiz-show kid fortune by his parents, seeks only to find a source of love and fulfillment in his failed life. Melora Walters plays a frazzled junkie whose miserable family experience has delivered her into the arms of drugs. The lives of these people, and several other maladjusted or mistreated souls, are all in the midst of one fracturing crisis or another. They sustain the plot on a seemingly endless crest of emotion that plays out over a 24-hr. span of confrontation and semi-redemption. Perhaps that's the problem. In merely focusing in on such a short span of time, Anderson forces us to see only what is germane to the actual events of the picture. When examining something so closely, one needs a great deal of light to see. In this case, we are bathed in a dazzling light of intense storytelling that unfortunately, by the end of the picture, has washed out much of the subtlety and definition of these characters.Take Moore's character, Linda Partridge for example. As the guilt riddled wife of a dying man, Linda careers from one confrontation to another, challenging her doctors, lawyers, pharmacists and ultimately herself to explain and alleviate the pain she feels for the man that she knows she married for all of the wrong reasons. Moore's performance is a tour-de-force; she is electric in her rage and anguish. Yet what Anderson's script never does is give us a clear picture of who she is when she's not in crisis. Where did this woman come from and what has made her who she is? The characters in this film seem to have no underpinnings. They are all spinning wildly as tops, never stopping for a moment to let those of us watching get a steady glimpse of what they look like still. The filmmaking too left me with a sense of being twirled around at great speed. Anderson's camera never seems to stop moving, swooping in and out of rooms and situations, following one character and then the next. The editing is swift and at times unfocused, leaving us hanging in the middle of one story line and jumping to the next with neither preamble nor explanation. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the cumulative effect of all this showmanship is exhaustion. I felt worn out by the end of the film, not by its message or impact, but rather by the sheer breadth of the filmmaking and Anderson's attempt to cram as much as possible into the movie. Ultimately the film suffers for this excess. By the climactic moment of the film, when the aforementioned natural disaster takes place, what should have been an emotional and spiritual epiphany, turns into a very funny, but rather hollow summation of the film's message. Anderson wants us to feel enlightened but I merely felt depleted and disappointed. This could have been a great film, with a firmer hand on the performances and the cinematic trickery. What is left, however, is still very rewarding and at times as brilliant and shimmering as any film in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the Kubrick comparisons?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers here have been comparing PT Anderson to Kubrick. Why? Yeah, I guess you can say "Magnolia" is like a lot like some of Kubrick's works in the sense that it was panned by many at first only to be worshipped years later, but people have been raving about this way more than "Eyes Wide Shut" and so far it's enjoyed a lot of acclaim.Kubrick's far from the only artist to be panned in the beginning only to be revered later; I don't even need to list all the artists this has happened to.Kubrick has and will be regarded as one of film's greatest directors, like it or not, and a lot of people have been heralding him as "the genius of film" now that he's dead. I think a lot of the comparisons are made because people love to be a part of the spectacle of genius. It's fun to crown another artistic messiah, and many people think Kubrick was the most recent one, so I guess that every promising director hereafther will be touted as "the next Kubrick" until we finally confirm our next artistic genius. This is the only way I can explain why I've seen these comparisons.But you can't tell me that these directors are alike. They made totally different movies, you don't need a critic to tell you that. You can compare DePalma and Hitchcock (no contest), you can discuss all the Kubrick references in Danny Boyle's stuff, but I don't see enough of a connection between PT Anderson and Kubrick to warrant some of the comparisons I've seen. Maybe Anderson was incredibly inspired by the guy, but I don't see anything in his movies that warrant the kind of relationships people conjure between the two.Just because two movies in one year last about three hours and feature Tom Cruise doesn't mean they should be placed side-by-side.</fullReview>

As the crowd exited the theatre this evening the usual rush for the exits was not present. I could not help notice the small clusters of people huddled together to discuss their theories on what we had all just seen. This movie is loaded with irony and remorse with each and every character. I found the acting to be absolutely superb by all of the players. But, one actor's performance stands out like a beacon on a foggy evening, Tom Cruise. Cruise's portrayal of a sleezy almost carnival-like sales preacher was done to perfection. This is the best I have seen Tom Cruise in a very long time, Bravo! The supporting cast in this film was equally wonderful as they led us through a journey of mixed emotions and ideas. I did find the movie a bit long, but at the same time I was sorry to see it end because I wanted to solve all of the movies' puzzles. Still, as I sit here nearly an hour after leaving the theatre I wonder about so many sequences in this film, and I'm sure I will continue to rewind this movie in my mind many times over. Myself and two friends saw this movie and we all have so many angles, too many to write in a few short words. See this movie with your friends and you will know what I mean.

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE BLEW ME AWAY!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. i had read both great reviews and also scathing ones. One thing I Knew from this is that i would either love it or hate it. The reviews gave me that impression, that there was no middle ground, one was going to love it or hate it. Well. I loved it!!!! Paul Thomas Anderson (that P.T. stuff sounds cheesy!) is the most talented filmmaker to come in a long time. As in his previous film Boogie Nights he presents his story in an epic scope, this time he tells the story of various different characters that are emotionally scarred, through events that happened in their families. The film does an incredible job of weaving these stories into the length of the film. the film is long but never boring, though not all the stories work equally well, the one that works the most is the one dealing with Tom Cruise and Jason Robards as father and son. i dont like giving story details so i wont, all i will say is that it is a story of pain and regret that is the center of the film. Tom Cruise does his best acting since Born on the Forth of July, he is absolutely brilliant here. Everyone is great in the film, but Cruise takes the cake. This movie done in a traditional way would have been a typical tearjerker, but Anderson turns it into an engrossing piece of work,though the movie is somewhat of a downer, it has energy which keeps you involved. In the last 30 minutes of the proceedings he presents us with an event that is simply astonishing, i wont say what it is, but lets just say that it is a jawdropper!!!! Im sure that this event will be the most talked about part of the film, it initially caused laughter in the audience, but put in the context of this film, it has relevence. The scene doesnt exactly improve the film but it is a brilliant change of pace.Many people im sure will say that Anderson is being self-indulgent with this film, but i dont agree. He has an energy in his style that is strongly reminiscent of Martin Scorsese. Though he is not yet in Marty's league, he shares in Scorsese's type of passionate filmmaking. This film is not for everyone, if you are looking for a film that is pandering and conventional you will be disappointed! If you are ready to spend 180 minutes thinking about what's going on screen you will love it!</fullReview>

But the more I have thought about the movie, and I have thought about it a lot, more so than any other film in recent history, the more I believe there really isn't a profound universal message. I'm not going to pretend to be some cinematic scholar, or dissect the symbolism. For some reason, this movie just has an effect on people. For some it is positive, and for others it is very, very negative. Whatever emotions this movie draws out, it does so to one extreme or the other. I'm going to see this movie again. I'll decide for myself whether it is genius or garbage. But no matter what, I will consider it a success in that it is able to elicit such strong emotion from everyone who views it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see Magnolia, I really didnt know what to expect, except a little of the basic plot, which is pretty much explained in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Ironically, the first five minutes of the film do nothing more than to explain, the next ( and unknowst to me) close to a 2hr 45 min movie. The film examines how people separate lives are all intertwined some how, and each have a involuntary impact on another. At first, it is difficult to remember who is connected to who and what, but by the end of the film, everyone flows smoothly into another naturally. I throughly loved this film, especially when all the characters sing along with a song at the same time, and the camera cuts to each one. I was almost in tears. The director could have ended the movie not long after it, but then an interesting thing happens. I won't write it down, but I'm still trying to figure it out! I also want to add that the actors performances in the film were pretty good. What surprised me was Tom Cruise, and his change throughout the film...definite Oscar nomination! Some things I didn't like? Well, at certain parts, I felt the movie drag, and I believe it could have ended earlier, and still get the point across, but hey?

But there is no earthly reason why this had to drag out for 3 hours. It could have been a ten for me if it had been trimmed of some of the excess verbiage and reiteration of the obvious.

Magnolia didn't score on the top of my list, but it definitley made an impact on me. I saw this film opening day on its wide release, January 7. Months before hand I knew about the film, and I couldn't wait for it to come out. When I saw the film, I wasn't dissapointed at all. I saw the best acting and the best editing of any film this year. The screenplay was amazing also. One thing I love about Paul Thomas Anderson is that he gets you into the characters. He makes them seem so real, and he makes you feel for them. Whether its hate, love, passion, etc. You feel something toward all the characters at the end. Now this movie is not the most redeeming movie. So dont expect to walk out of it with a big smile on your face. It's a movie about hardships, and reality. That's as much as I'll say about this film without giving any of it away. I feel this movie will either be loved by you, or it will be hated. But in 30 years from now, everyone will say they loved it right from the beginning. It is truly a magnificent film.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prime example of why one should distrust the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with "professional" film critics is that they are aware they are writing for history as well as for their employers. Any critic writing for a mass audience knows that his or her reputation depends in part on how often his or her judgment jibes with that of the public, which is the real and final arbiter of a film's success or failure. Every critic writing must be wary of sharing the wretched fate of those 1939 pundits who panned, say, the Wizard of Oz, or Gone With the Wind, or the scribes who in 1941 turned thumbs down on Citizen Kane. So when there appears a movie which bears all the signs of being a "big" film -- big budget, big stars, hot director, contemporary subject matter -- critics get curiously pusillanimous about reporting the flaws that may ultimately be identified as having turned that "big" production into a big turkey. This phenomenon, I believe, explains why the critics have been raving about Magnolia -- a film so arrogant in its ambition yet so confused and inept in its execution that the appellation turkey hardly does it justice. Other critics in this forum have already competently catalogued Magnolia's myriad shortcomings and I do not propose to cover the same territory. Suffice to say that when I saw this thing the other night a number of people walked out long before it splattered to its long-delayed and eagerly sought conclusion. There is the judgment totally independent of history. I stayed until the end, but I envied those who didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie kept me riveted for most of the 3+ hours. The acting is superb, some of the finest I've ever seen! This movie is very original, too - not in its themes, but in its format. The intensity level was very high more than once (this is a plus for me). The only complaint I had was that the music in one scene was too loud to hear the conversation going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly human film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when I was stuck at a mall with nothing to do while my car was being serviced.I wouldn't have been surprised had I completely hated Magnolia. I don't in general admire new, young directors. Their movies seem to be cruel and valueless and use human misery as a cynical punchline (e.g., Tarrantino and his buddies).Magnolia is a beautifully UN-cynical cautionary tale about the dire consequences of treating those around you in a selfish and cruel way. In brief, it's a film about the power of understanding and kindness. What a wonderful, refreshing, much needed premise! It's hard to speak great truths and seem fresh and original, which probably explains why so many new directors opt for a cynical smirk instead of reaching for something greater.There's nothing "post-human" in Magnolia, and for that I'm grateful. I missed boogie nights expecting it to be more of the usual Tarrantino-clone crap. Maybe it is, but now at least I'm going to give it a chance on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After my friend and I came out of this movie, she said, "My girlfriend is waiting for me to call her and tell her if she should go see this movie and I really don't know WHAT I should tell her!" That about summed it up. When you get out of this movie after three hours of visual and audio assault, you are spinning. Spinning with plots started and never resolved, spinning with awe for the actors, spinning with trying to realize how someone could write this and put it all together. Perhaps the whole idea of this film is to get the audience into the minds and souls of its pathetic characters and, since most of them are on the brink of destruction, we are kept off-kilter from the very beginning with the bizarre opening sequence about coincidences. The music is probably the most effective way to drive the audience mad, as it is overbearingly loud through most of the film. The songs are given center stage and are never faded out, but play, full-volume over dialogue and anything else that happens to be going on. In my opinion, very annoying, but maybe the point was to make me annoyed, on-edge and raw.The acting was unbelievable! YES, Tom Cruise was fantastic! He had some of the best lines with his seminar "Seduce and Destroy". Hilarious and an excellent parody of real seminars. Jason Robards...wow! He is supposed to be playing a dying man and he IS that dying man...his physical appearance, the way he forgets what he's saying, his lines are all REAL. Melora Walters is PERFECT as the coke freak. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's wonderful little part, perfectly portrayed, as the old queen.This is one of the few movies that I would have preferred to see at home, alone, just me and my video, because then I could have rewound it to listen to parts that flew by, watched the great bits twenty times and stopped it in the middle and come back when I had more strength. And that is exactly what I would tell my friend's friend, and anyone else who asks me if they should see this movie, to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a series of impressive scenes, but that's easier to do when you make no pretense of establishing narrative cohesiveness. The acting is uniformly superior (Tom Cruise is particularly brilliant)and the writing powerful, but one big scene after another gets redundant. And the portrayal of a TV game show is ludicrous, especially given recent developments in TV quiz shows. It's a good film trying hard to be a great film; it gets points for trying, but it doesn't quite make it. It's not a swing and a miss; it's a swing for the fences that results in a double.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are 2 kinds of people in this film: those who seek salvation by seeking forgiveness and those who want to forgive. Does this make the movie interesting? Not really. The story starts out by engaging us in the theory of coincidence v. divine intervention (or some other otherworldly force), but after 1 hr. (yes, I checked my watch), the story dries up. Characters offer no insight other than each one confessed infidelity, children want their parent's to love them, and Tom Cruise just wants his mommy. Speaking of Cruise, what makes him think he's acting? He only stares, seemingly at the bridge of his co-actor's nose. He never shows any emotion with his eyes; he doesn't look around the other person's face; he just stares fixedly at a single point and yells, complains, cries, curses. That's not acting. And believe me, I tried very hard to get something from his performance....there just wasn't anything there. Most of the characters lacked depth. There was an illusion of characterization, but no substance. Philip Seymour Hoffman did a great job as did Julianne Moore, and frankly, the other actors were good, but there wasn't much written for them. It's a writing problem, a story problem. Each successive scene gave each character less and less to say and had me counting the minutes until it's end.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" may be one of the most ambitious films of the year, possibly of the decade. A complex 12-character storyline, the demand for the audience to absorb large amounts of info at a time, and a running time over 3 hours. All of these together means that you will either love or hate this film. But, altogether, how does work out? Perfectly.The plot of the film is so complex it can't be explained. Trying to explain the plot would be like trying to describe the taste of a 4-course meal in one word. The numerous sub-plots(which is probably the wrong word to use, their is no "main" plot of which the sub-plots branch off) are so complex and intricatley woven that you would otherwise feel like you are watching 12 films at once(but you're not). I read an interview someone did with the director P.T. Anderson, and when the interviewer asked him, "So what's the movie about?", he just responded with a blank stare. He did this rightly so, you cannot say what this movie is "about".The character development and acting are amazing. Earlier I said that it feels like you are watching 12 different films, but the characters all have things in common that (acted so well), everything flows together. It's a wonderful study of people's emotions on love and being alone as opposed to an editing disaster like it could have been. The dialogue in the film also occasionally lends itself to melodrama (not always, just sometimes), but everyone in the film makes their dialogue so real that it doesn't seem that way.The film's detractors for this film all have their own slighly varying opinion's on it, but most of them are all saying (either with directly or with intelectual trimmings) "Its too long and its boring". I think that these people are more used to evenly paced films, something that moves along at the same speed, until eventually coming to a climax. This film is not that, and is not for everyone's taste. If you want to see a film that consist of predictable plot structuring, I dont think you would like this film. However, if you are more open-minded towards new idea's in cinema, and want to see one of the best movies of the year, see Magnolia. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most creative movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is the film that will change the future of movies. Brilliantly written by P.T. Anderson, one wonders how he can come up with so much for one movie. Magnolia takes twists and turns that one would never have dreamed of in a million years, leaving audiences in either shock,awe, or dismay. Personally, it left me in awe. I have never seen another movie remotely like this, nor expect to again in the near future. Magnolia's story is smart and brilliant and each of the characters has so much emotional depth it's hard to fathom. With an all-star cast (who all deserve Oscars for their performances) and Anderson's script, Magnolia will take audiences where they've never been before and for some people, it may be too much, but for the smart movie-goers, it's a movie they will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Magnolia. The writing, acting, directing was the best that I have seen in a long time. The character development was possibly the best I have seen. The only contender here is "all quiet on the western front."However, this movie is not for everyone - in fact I think it is only for a small part of the movie going population. It is for people who are willing to take a chance, and follow through on it. I don't think I've ever seen so many people walk out of a movie, but it felt like the movie was trying to get rid of those who didn't have the guts to make it.I don't reccomend this movie to anyone, but if someone wants to go see it - I'll be happy for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great great great followup to Boogie Nights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I'm very happy to see come out. This being one of the last films to come out in 99, looking back it was a great year for films. American Beauty, The Green Mile, Run Lola Run, Being John Malcovich, Three Kings, and Fight Club all came out this year. And to end it off, we get this stunning, make that astounding, piece of cinema.The story to this is complex at the same time it is engaging and very interesting. Paul Thomas Anderson is todays Stanley Kubrick, Hard Eight and Boogie Nights were outstanding (Boogie Nights being one of my all time favorites), this however is a near masterpiece.The acting from Tom Cruise and Julienne Moore is by far the best of both their careers, this is the film Cruise should be remembered by and he should hold that Best Supporting Actor award up high in March when the Academy Awards come along. John C. Rieley is also outstanding playing one of the most believeable cop roles I've seen since Serpico. Just watch his actions to everything, he makes Jim Carrey's performance in Man on the Moon almost look tame. I could go on and on about every character, but this is so well casted it's like every actor was born to play these roles.Again, Paul Thomas Anderson (make that P.T. Anderson now) is just pure genius. Watch for the long cuts and some brilliant camerawork throughout. I almost forgot to mention, Magnolia also has one of the best opening scenes that I've seen in recent years, it entirely sets you up for the film. If you would consider Quentin Tarantino the master of screen writing today, then P.T. Anderson should be considered the master of directing.Like a Stanley Kubrick film, half will love and half will hate. But like another reviewer said, those same people that said they hated it will say they love it 20 years from now. Why? Because those are the people that don't know how to appreciate cinema and need to start learning there is a lot more than special effects, blazing guns, and toilet humor that films have to offer us. I work at a video store and it's the same people that seem to love crap like Universal Soldier: The Return and bad mouth The Matrix. I guess films like this are meant for a more mature and understanding audience. That would be my only concern for the film, the childish reviews that don't know how to give chance and justice to a true masterpiece like this. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw 'Magnolia' tonight. I'd have to give it about a seven out of ten, earned almost exclusively through brilliant editing and acting. Many will leave puzzled, I did, what does it all mean?? One can't oversimplify this movie, it conveys many messages at many levels, towards everyone from child to dying elderly. The acting, as one would expect from such a cast, is brilliant: Tom Cruise seems to somehow fit perfectly as the 'man power' guru, and William H. Macy turns out another strong performance a former child-star, who's life has diminished into confusion, and low-self esteem. It is certainly in a league of its own, and will probably be regarded as one of the innovative cinematic triumphs of the nineties, by critics. That said, my butt was pretty sore after it, and lets face it, many people won't go for this type of film because of its 'slow' scenes. I don't need to bash those people, they have their tastes, I'll definitely be giving this film a second look sometime though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weird but just as memorable (***1/2 out of ****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having already seen "Boogie Nights" and the trailer for "Magnolia," I was very eager for the arrival of this movie. After all, Paul Thomas Anderson is great when it comes to character studies (the only other film I've seen from him is BOOGIE NIGHTS, but watch that and you'll see what I mean). In the end, it's tough to argue which of the two is a better movie, but MAGNOLIA undoubtedly presents a greater challenge. This is one of those rare movies that cannot be explained in a simple plot synopsis, it basically tells numerous different character stories and interwinds them as time goes along. Simply put, this is unusual mainstream fare.Ah, where to begin..... I'll start by saying that the acting all around is excellent. Since this is an ensemble piece, there are no leads and no supporting characters, but everyone turns in a memorable performance. This, however, will be a problem for the Academy (that is, if they can improve their short memory spans). If MAGNOLIA gets a handful of acting nominations, it will be tough to decide which categories to distribute actors to. Much of the cast from Boogie Nights is back, and it's great to see that so many of them like working with Anderson so much that they'd return a second time.I have read some complaints about the "soap opera" nature of this movie. There may be an element of truth to that statement, but really, MAGNOLIA succeeds wonderfully when it comes to character relationships. If there's a hint of melodrama, there's certainly a good reason for it. Soap operas and TV sit-coms try desperately to engage the emotions and/or the funny bone with cheap, formulaic, and predictable writing and acting (Seinfeld being THE LONE exception). Movies, on the other hand, sometimes sccumb to "TV" tactics, but in films like MAGNOLIA, the idea is to keep the narrative flowing and the chracters realized. The emotions should just naturally evolve out of whatever is there.For a three-hour movie, MAGNOLIA generates a surprisingly fast pace for most of the time, and because of the unpredictable nature of how the movie is going to end, it's very difficult to walk out. Unfortunately, there is a bit of obvious lag early on in the movie's final hour, and that's what causes MAGNOLIA to miss a four-star rating from me. Speaking of the ending, I won't give it away, but it has to be one of the most bizarre sequences in modern movie history, rivaling anything in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH. Jaws will hit the floor throughout the theater! Of course, I'm still wondering what the point of it is, but it must somehow contribute to one of the movie's two themes, that the strangest things can happen by pure coincidence. Nothing prepared me for MAGNOLIA's conclusionThe other theme in Magnolia is stated several times: "You may be done with the past, but the past isn't through with you." All of the characters in this movie have a troubled past of some sort, and while they move on while hiding behind a mask, the events that take place strongly suggest that their pasts aren't yet through delivering an impact.Simply put, Magnolia is not for everyone. Those who are looking for something conventional should alter their expectations. Yes, Magnolia is easily coherent and realtively straightforward, but there's an underlying weirdness and audacity that will turn off some viewers. For everyone else, I highly recommend this motion picture, and I see it as more of an experience than a mere movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways, "Magnolia" is a remake of Robert Altman's 1993 "Short Cuts". Both are stories about the disparate lives of far-flung Californians who come together in unexpected and intriguing ways. Both even climax with cataclysmic and powerful natural events (though "Magnolia"'s is admittedly more unusual, novel, and certainly more memorable). However, while Altman views his characters with his usual omniscience and ironic sense of reserve, Paul Thomas Anderson, the writer and director of "Magnolia", is down in the trenches with his characters, feeling them, bleeding for them. This film is a startling act of cinematic empathy, more nakedly emotional than perhaps any film I have seen this year. The film whips up a tremendous group of characters into a propulsive, teeming mass, and sets them at us with tremendous ingeniuity and power. The film basically centers around Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), a TV executive dying of cancer and tended by a sensitive nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a trophy wife (Julianne Moore) who married Earl for his money and who now finds, as he's on his deathbed, that it's really love. Earl's dying wish is to be reunited with his estranged son (Tom Cruise), a deeply scarred man who runs misogynistic seminars guiding men on how to "Seduce and Destroy". Also in the mix is another cancer victim, a game show host (Philip Baker Hall) with an estranged, cocaine-addled daughter (Melora Walters) who sees through her haze long enough to feel the real love from a gentle, lonely police officer (John C. Reilly). Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), the star contestant on the game show, is heading for a breakdown much like the one suffered by "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a former child star who's now a broken down sad sack. The way all these characters fight and share secrets, love and hate and waste away, is brought together by Anderson with a beguiling combination of tenderness and ferocity that all leads up to a real head-scratcher of an occurence that nonetheless allows the characters to gain perspective and see the changes they must make in order to get through things properly. The film touches on issues of family, the way the past haunts us, and the cosmic design that hides behind the randomness of everyday life.Anderson's grandiose and emotional direction and screenplay are fully supported by brilliant ensemble acting. Among the stunning performances, Reilly stands out with his goodness and sincerity. Walters makes us feel for the addled druggie she has become and the hurt, confused little girl still lurking inside. Hall just has to drop his eyes, and it's devastating. Robards has a deathbed monologue that's wrenching in its clarity and helplessness. Moore once again impresses with her laser-accurate anger. And Cruise, pretty boy Tom Cruise, is a knockout here, strutting, spewing obscenities, and finally playing a breakdown scene so naked and confused that it's truly painful to watch. The other standout star of the film is Jon Brion, who composed the moody and insistent score that Anderson audaciously plays almost continuously under the middle hour of the film. It works, giving the moments a stirring turbulence that clarifies the emotions onscreen. Aimee Mann also contributes several touching songs (one of which is sung, in a terrific scene, by the whole cast, all in separate places, all alone)."Magnolia" isn't always clear in its intentions or its conclusions, but the questions it raises are potent and important. It's a vital and exciting film, one that will be talked about for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performances, poor plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is a tale of the intertwining lives of 12 or so characters living in Southern California. The film starts out interesting enough, with an explanation of three supposedly bizarre circumstances, which the narrator says must be more than mere coincidence. The film goes on to display ten stories that...you guessed it, all are related. However, some of these connections are minimal at best. For example, take the dying game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who cheated on his wife and molested his coke-addicted daughter. His connection one of the other main characters (Earl Partridge) is that Patridge's production company produces "What Do Kids Know," the game show that Gator hosts. This bit of information is revealed as we view the credits of Gator's game show. It's moments like these that make the movie feel forced.The film also has an overwhelming air of pretentiousness. Paul Thomas Anderson tries way too hard to make his movie seem abstract, deep, and complex. The result is wannabe-art-house, neo-eccentric crap. Other problematic scenes include Phil Pharma's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) "this is like a scene in a movie" monologue, which desperately tries to be ironic, the scene in which all of the characters sing the same song, and one scene involving a plague of frogs that is just too long and too bizarre. Anderson is saying, "I'm so brilliant," yet the audience (at least myself) is thinking, "Enough already!"Other problems include subplots that are completely unimportant. Although I usually really like William H. Macy, he was a major detractor in this film. His character, former quiz kid Donnie Smith, seems to stick out like a sore thumb; his story just isn't interesting -- AT ALL. Many have complained that this film is too long (and I'm inclined to somewhat agree -- 3 hrs. and 20 minutes); they could have entirely cut out Smith and his story, and the audience would have been all the luckier.However, there is some saving grace to this movie, and that is the performances. Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters are all fantastic. So is Tom Cruise in a bold role as sex guru Frank TJ Mackie. In fact, I liked all of the performances (save William H. Macy, but that was mainly because his character incited nothing but boredom). I really recommend that anyone who reads this and hasn't seen the movie skip it. If you really want to see the great acting, wait until this one appears on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People condescendingly call this an "artsy" film without realizing it IS art. This was a beautiful film along the lines of American Beauty and Eyes Wide Shut. It follows the same path of Boogie Nights and Hard 8 as in the pacing varies quickly yet with such fluidity. I love the idea of coincidences and the seemingly ridiculous way in which people can drastically affect others' lives.The performances were flawless and I couldn't help but be drawn in and feel exactly what each was feeling. Tom Cruise is true to his character as an unwitting but steadfast sexist pig. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a believable and sympathetic victim. I would have to say that the best performance came from John C. Reilly (P.T. Anderson likes actors with long names it seems :) Simply a man trying to do right by everyone around him and a beautifully honest individual. And in the end with each characters' regret being so painstakingly drawn out, the suspense is built without the dramatic Hollywood score but with incredible acting. Beautiful.I had only one problem with it and that was the bit of drag during Jason Robard's speech to Phil which I think could have been taken in a bit. But I trust the director and just as Stanley Kubrick, I left the film full and satisfied. I think Paul is one of the best directors of the 90s up there with the Coen Bros. "Artsy," no.

What you are about to witness is like a three-ring circus. Try to keep your interest high because it will all pay off.For those who want eye-candy and witless entertainment, go see "Deuce Bigalow". For others who want to be challenged by what they see on the silver screen, drop your ten bucks on the table and enjoy. There's no need to go into the details of what the movie is about, because it'll be different for everybody. Just know this, it's loaded with comedy, high drama, and heart-wrenching tragedy. It's nothing you've seen before or are likely to see again. Three hours long and I was craving for another three. S*** Happens, and that's all "Magnolia" is trying to say. Don't look for hidden meanings and deep thoughts...they're not there. It's a very simple premise, as shown in the first three stories before the actual film starts. Follow along, listen to the narrator, and fit the pieces together. S*** happens everyday!</fullReview>

I found the Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore roles hampered by too much ACTING (remember Jon Lovitz' ham on the old SNL - that's what Cruise and Moore were doing - ACTING) BY contrast O'Reilly and Hoffman showed us real people reacting to real life. I also thought the part of Donnie Smith was a bit off - his dialogue sounded strained and unreal, in spite of the wonderful Wm. Macy. However, those comments aside, it is a terrific movie, a terrific set of stories and I hope Paul Anderson wins every award in the book. a truly original, creative film maker.

		<fullReview>This film is a tour de force in all respects including intricate storytelling, ominous portents, and the sheer test it makes of the audience's patience.It has impressed many reviewers, and I can see why -- great performances and elaborate interweaving of stories about pain, love, and redemption. BUT...The film is also overly indulgent in its longwinded plotting. It has weight all right -- the weight of an opera that seems to be going somewhere, but, like life, seems to get nowhere. Yes, it's like an opera, and at the same time, it's like a crossword puzzle. In other words, it is clever the way all the tiny pieces come together and seem to make words, but in the end, perhaps it was not worth all the ado.And don't miss the heavyhanded hints: watch for the signs reading Exodus 8:2. In case you are wondering or don't have a Bible handy, that's the verse about the plague of the frogs. At the end, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or yawn. Thumbs down on the plot but thumbs up for the actors.</fullReview>

Not the best picture of the year by any means, but it is definately "different" from most of the films made today. It was worth the money just to watch the techniques used with the camera.

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A lot of people complain that this movie lacked a real plot or storyline and I have seen some reviews that say the characters are not well developed. Well this movie did not intend to do any of that. It was basicly a slice of life and each character had their own story. A lot of "good" movies out there are good because they tell a good story. Saving Private Ryan tells a very good story of epic proportions, but Magnolia is so much better because it does not do these things. It tells a story about average people who make mistakes, average people in which you can relate to. This is a much needed change to other heroic almosy super human characters in other movies. One of the best parts of this movie is its ending. While it has no real ending each character is given a secound chance at fixing their life. Overall Magnolia is the best movie I have seen in a long time and is well deserving of an Oscar for best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sit here with my movie ticket stub in my hand amazed, shocked and awed. Having heard nothing of the film "Magnolia" before yesterday I am stunned. Almost impossible to wrap into so few words my advice is go and see it. It is without a doubt one of the highest of calibre films I have ever seen. It makes an intelligent man/woman think and keeps everyone else entertained. Seen from the view points of multiple characters the film takes us through the nature of the human condition. We see abuse, we see death, we see depression and we see addiction. "Save me from the ranks of the freaks, who suspect they could never love anyone". These words are spoken straight from the theme song of the movie, Aimee Mann's "Save Me". They describe the movie to a fuller extent then anyone else can in one phrase. Pain is shown. The world is shown. Biblical references and a load of sub-text is thrown at the audience. This is a film that will keep you thinking for hours. Not about the film so much. More about existence, and while that sounds superficial it is unbelievably true. I can't remember when my mind has been so provoked to think. So here's my advice: Go see the film. Then see it again, and while watching the film "Magnolia" keep in mind Aimee Mann's words."Save me from the ranks of the freaks, who could never love anyone."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's brilliant, complex, and a bit too much. I still liked it.All the criticisms of this movie are right on. It's too long, a bit excessive, and not entirely sure what it is trying to do. The several Exodus references were a bit excessive (okay, PT, we get the point). But I was fascinated nonetheless. Visually, it's brilliant and inventive. (Check out Stanley looking up at the coming rain, the back-and-forth movement of Claudia and Jim, or an oddly hilarious recounting of a suicide shown in the style of an NFL chalkboard instant replay.) The plot has a simple core yet extends and folds upon itself in several wonderful ways.Perhaps I just want to give Anderson more credit than he deserves - he has taken on an absolutely enormous project here, more ambitious than nearly anyone in Hollywood would ever dare to be. "Magnolia" will probably be a commercial failure, and it may teach Anderson to exercise a bit of self-control next time - either that or he'll never work again. (Let's hope for the former; he really is talented.) I'm not sure what to think of this movie, but I know that I want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woo Hoo! Paul Thomas Anderson has created his opus! Magnolia is a gripping, intense, flippant comedy-drama that keeps its motor going for its entire 179 minute run, never once running out of gas. An homage to great films like Nashville, Magnolia tells the stories of several different characters over the course of one fateful night. Unique to this film is the fact that the characters all seem to carry some painful secret that comes to full fruition with the help of some great music. As the film opens, doors to the past are opened and painful memories are slowly revealed. One of the opening scenes has Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) investigating a domestic dispute. He finds a dead body in a woman's apartment. This story isn't explored, so much as it is used (I suppose) as a metaphor for the stories to come. Open up the closet and the skeletons come pouring out.Magnolia explores a multitude of subjects mostly surrounding family troubles. The characters are intense, emotional wrecks. Some of them may appear strong, however, as their pain creeps up on them they manage to crumble. Anderson plays with our heads a bit in this outing. Characters who we think are gentle beings turn out to be monsters. Characters who we think are selfish pricks turn out to be fragile. I must say that twenty four hours after seeing this film I still haven't got it all together. Scenes are still swirling around in my head. There is no point in running through the plot of this one because there was just so much happening on the screen that it would take forever and it would never make sense. As a matter of fact, I think the narrator of this film warned us that that was the point of this film.The acting here is first rate. Everyone delivers an Oscar calibre performance. Stand outs include Tom Cruise as the 'Stephen Covey for macho men' guru and Julianne more as the frantically guilt-ridden opportunist who's rich older husband is dying. Anderson reminds that Altman's style has been borrowed for this film by including Henry Gibson is a supporting-supporting role. However, this is not an all-out rip off of Altman's work. Somehow I doubt that anyone would have the guts to include some of the wonderfully bizarre plot twists that Anderson uses for this film. I write this on December 30, 1999 and I suspect that those bull frogs will go down as the most indelible film image I have seen this century! --- And I have seen a lot of strange stuff!Just when we thought film makers had done it all, 1999 turns out to be a great year for unusual and original films. Magnolia is certainly the coup de gras!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a close up is so close, you don't get the whole picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many will say the acting was great, but the set-up of "Magnolia, " cutting and pasting together the "big" scenes, limits the range of acting. There's no time/space for the aura of a "personality" of a character* who is constantly seen in the "performance" role; otherwise the camera is on a face that fills the whole screen. The spotlight is always on; I'd like to know what is happening on the side, as that can be more telling. But there is no time for subtle transitions or shades of gray here; everything is over the top and hence, a bit much! Sometimes a close up is so close, you don't get the whole picture.  I liked the difference-ness of the movie and would see it again, but I think most would find it somewhat tedious after the initial humor and then going places not very appealing. The cinematography is good with many authentic, life-like scenes (yet no landscapes which often imply great cinematography).*John Reilly's officer is the exception; some of his scenes are more "background" than in your face, and hence more fully developed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As P.T. Anderson slips further and further away from the staged drama of "Hard Eight" (Sydney to everyone outside the U.S.) his audiences are rewarded by modern epic masterpieces. In Magnolia, Anderson assembles his most impressive acting troupe yet, in a movie which should hold theaters captive for years to come. If Boogie Nights was Anderson's take on the porn industry, then Magnolia will be enshrined as his take on loneliness. This film is, at it's most basic, the story of 5 lonely people whose inability to find ways to give and take love to and from others winds them into a complicated maze of plots circling around each other like a Maypole. This movie should be seen and re-seen: there's a lot going on inside this film. Most instantly laudable is the best acting of Tom Cruise's career, and more notches in the belt for Julianne Moore, John Reilly and Phillip Hoffman who all turn in Anderson-inspired turns of greatness. Don't miss this film - it will be with you for a long time.</fullReview>

This film is brilliant in its intermingling of characters and stories, but this complexity lacks a defining single character. Each actor performs their role tremendously, and the human drama is extremely powerful in this film. It is interesting and reassuring to see that so many actors from Boogie Nights are included in this film, and each does an amazing job in Magnolia. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one actor in particular that has a bright future. He has done amazing work in the past, and he seems to be headed in the right direction for the future.

They might even extol MAGNOLIA for the same reason. To do so, will be a disservice to one of this decade's most gifted filmmakers. Yes, there are cinematic nods to Mr. Altman's influence (for instance, in the casting of Henry Gibson from NASHVILLE) But in this wonderful film, about the weird synchronicity of life; Mr. Anderson playfully tosses these kinds of filmic treats throughout the movie. He does this in his choice of casting and even soundtrack music.MAGNOLIA is a funny, mesmerizing display of parallels.of synchronicity. And MAGNOLIA is also an examination of how one person can impact the lives of other. It's like the Kabbalist teach, when we act in a wholly negative manner, that act will create an evil angel. That angel will do its work.There will be lots of blah blah blah about Oscars and it's all deserved, especially for the cast. I've gone this far without revealing the plot(s) of MAGNOLIA. I wouldn't dare. This is film that is rich with surprise from a director who obviously enjoys MOVIES. After spending three hours with MAGNOLIA.I want to spend three more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia a movie produced, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson Magnolia ties together multiple narrative stories in this 3-hour production. Theme in the movie is seen as parental neglect and abuse. A good aspect of the film is the editing and the shots taken. It creates a good flow of the movie and the consistency of how fast the movie went. The Overall performance was good I find, however, the some scenes were random and maybe irrelevant which did slow down the film and affect my experience toward it. The acting was amazing and would say that Tom Cruise was the MVP both his acting and the character he played were both amazing in the film. Then we see the cop, John C. Reily, who played a good cop performance. Now the two weakest characters I found were Macy's and Moore. Macy's character, the whiz kid Donnie Smith, didn't impact as much. His scenes and his character were random all through the movie. Although he fits the theme of the movie as we see his back story explained. William H. Macy although a good actor his performance as this character didn't draw much attention and I find didn't seem all that relevant in the movie. Moore's character was a lot of the time mad and flipping people off and being all crazy though out the film. Maybe without her in the film, the film would've been tighter and maybe would've been a better overall performance. John C Reily's voice over in the film, I find, to be the second best part of the movie. Although he comes off as pretentious and religious, Paul Thomas Anderson, uses his monologue to create a feeling like we were actually his partner in crime is the film. The near ending of the film, the other whiz kid, Stanley and his interaction with his father was really weak. We see at the end of the film many resolutions found in each of the individual characters problems. His interaction mixed in it was flat and could've been a more powerful and meaningful dialogue between the two. The best performance, of course, in the film was Tom Cruise and his character. His monologue and scenes all taking in one shot was near impossible not to get drawn in and really intrigued with this character. Overall I rate this film 8/10 and would watch again.</fullReview>

Magnolia is based on the principle that coincidences, no matter how absurd or unbelievable they may seem occur quite regularly. This is told through a series of characters that are related to each other in one way or the other. The acting from almost every actor is delightful which takes this movie to another level. Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore are the best performers amongst a number of worthy performances. The film is complex and one viewing will be insufficient to understand the various intricacies surrounding the movie. A movie like this demands to be seen.

		<shortDescription>Review: Magnolia (1999) - A Visually Striking and Heartfelt Drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six months ago, whilst spending some time in Tulsa, Oklahoma, I came across a copy of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia on Blu-ray?. It has since sat on my media shelf accumulating dust, as well as a couple additional "I'll watch them later's," atop it. With Inherent Vice on the horizon, I decided to watch the very film I've been neglecting for six months, and as some would say, my life. I figured, "I've more or less enjoyed everything that PTA has put his hands on, so I'll make some time to watch Magnolia tomorrow". Three hours after pressing play, I am left happy and genuinely affected by this film. Let me tell you why.Marked by outstanding performances and extraordinary cinematography, Magnolia is one of the last film-making punches delivered by the '90's. Robert Elswit (Nightcrawler, Michael Clayton) brings his coveted expertise to the production. It's no wonder that Anderson has worked with him on most (all but one) of his features. The framing of shots is impeccable and lends itself well into the context of the film. Some of Elswit's shots were so perfect that they felt, to me, otherworldly. That level of attention to detail in a film like this is what sets it far apart from any similar in scale. At 188 minutes, not a shot outstays its welcome. Anderson and his crew have created a water-tight film in many respects, but none more than his cast.This film is one about human beings; people who are trying to make a connection, and the happenstances that bind them to one another, whether they are aware of it or not. There are no weak or one-note performances in this film. The story does not unfold, it is commanded, transition by transition through the performances. Particularly John C. Reilly in his role as Officer Jim, William H. Macy as Donnie Smith, a former child genius, Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Phil. I believed these actors in their respective roles; each seeking something entirely dependent on their connection with another human being. The juxtaposition of Donnie Smith and Stanley Spector is my favorite character oriented decision made creatively for this film. William H. Macy provides something of a window into latter's dismal future, as it would be, were it not to change course. Some proving to be more successful in their quests than others.What I was not expecting when endeavoring into Magnolia was the visual poetry and eloquent little flourishes that pepper this film. I constantly found myself relishing in the genius of some of Anderson's touches throughout the film. Even the most intimately sized scenes in this film, such as Donnie Smith's conversation with Thurston Howell (Henry Gibson) feel organic to the nature of the film's scale and serve the over-arching premise. When other films try their luck at letting small occurrences and scenarios serve to usher the plot forward delicately, it most always comes off as too quick, heavy-handed, or unnecessary, but here, such touches as "BUT IT DID HAPPEN" on the painting in the apartment do more for the story than any human words possibly could. Or perhaps the sequence in which all of the characters, in each of their states of life, sing along to Aimee Mann's "Wise Up". It caters to an almost euphoric tone, which perfectly stages the remainder of the film for the masterful execution it receives.Forgiveness, acceptance, and love take center stage in this somber tale, and culminates in a more than satisfying ending. Paul Thomas Anderson is quoted as saying that Magnolia "is for better or worse, the best movie he'll ever make". I think he set the bar pretty high with his sophomore film, but continues to create great works. All said, Magnolia can be most concisely described as a master stroke on the canvas of cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Facing the past !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Paul Thomas Anderson admirer. He is one of the very few directors working today who can genuinely be called a master director. Magnolia is considered to be one of his best films and I decided to check it out. It involves a huge ensemble cast. There are a large number of characters all of whose lives are tangentially connected. They deal with their lives in their own ways, while the spectre of melancholy hangs in the air.Like all other Anderson films, Magnolia is thematically very deep. There are a large number of themes that are at work like parental ignorance, parental abuse, sins of the father affecting the child, how a traumatic childhood can have long-lasting and mentally scarring effects on a person even during his/her adult life, the torturing effect that your past can have on you, forgiveness, achieving some form of redemption, searching for a deeper meaning out of random coincidences and last but by no means least, what can be forgiven and what can't.As expected the movie is visually vibrant. The colour blue plays a great role and sort of chases every character as a mark of pain, suffering and melancholy. Like "There Will Be Blood", god is very much present in Magnolia. Like humans, god also makes decisions regarding what actions are worth forgiving and what actions aren't. The film is 3 hours long. But due to the fast nature of the screenplay, the time just flies by without the viewer noticing. The film boasts of tour de force editing. Anderson's love for Scorsese is again very much apparent in the movie with the long tracking shots.The acting is good from all the actors. Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman deserve a special mention.While watching I thought there were some scenes which went a bit overboard and crossed the limits of theatricality. However on retrospection by considering how the film ends, I think a film dealing with such larger than life themes has to include some overly dramatic elements. The movie ends with a scene which I consider to be one of the most awe-inspiring moments in cinematic history. That scene has both visual brilliance as well as thematic potency and relevance. That climax alone makes the film worth viewing again and again. The film has religious undertones, but Anderson never allows the characters to get drowned under the weight of the religious themes. He loves his characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable and Heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm struggling to begin this review as there are no words that are equal to the experience that is 'Magnolia'.'Magnolia' is a 188 minute extravaganza that interlinks the broken lives of several residents in the San Fernando Valley. Directed by PT Anderson and starring Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, Jason Robards and Jeremy Blackman, this film boasts an endless list of good qualities.First on the list of praise is the story, or should I say 'stories'. The film follows nine different story lines that connect with each other in one way or another. Each narrative creates an impact that induces a range of emotions from empathy to hatred to pain to redemption. I think this goes without saying but the film is very melancholy in its themes and characters. The film explores several themes including impossible love, infidelity, drug addiction, terminal illness, sexual abuse and suicide. The film's 3 hour runtime may throw some viewers off but the steady pace of the stories keeps audiences interested with something always happening.The cinematography is executed gorgeously to make the audience understand the stories and to build a suspense for the film's unique and controversial climax. The song 'Wise Up' by Aimee Mann accompanies one of my favourite scenes in movie history and adds to the sombre mood that this film perfectly portrays.The casting of this film is just perfect. Personally, I dislike Tom Cruise as an actor but he gives an outstanding performance as a televangelist who tries to teach men how to seduce women. He's dislikable and cold which is why it's perfect for this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a great performance as the caring nurse to a dying Jason Robards and Julianne Moore plays Robards' wife who slowly delves into insanity. The rest of the cast play great roles and they all maintain the solemn attitude that this film boasts.The conclusion to this epic strikes a controversy with religion when its weather of biblical proportions throws audiences out of the stories towards the end of the film. It acts as a perfect counterpart to the ten minute introduction on coincidences before the film begins. PT Anderson displays a series of stories that end disjointedly and abruptly to remind audiences that this is the real world and life doesn't always end on resolved issues.Overall, this film is a definite 10/10 for me as it ticks every box technically and emotionally and I'd recommend this to anyone who has a spare three hours. You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant epic with emotional depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's third feature film 'Magnolia' is a mosaic account of the intertwining lives of several characters in the San Fernando Valley. It is an interesting storyline and a fascinating study of human emotions. Echoing the great late Robert Altman, this three-hour epic divides screen time between each member of the ensemble cast, among which Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly, Phillip Baker Hall and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) has a chequered past, abandoned by his father Earl (Jason Robards) when his mother got cancer, and this scar caused him to become an expert in women manipulation. The emotional depth shown by Cruise is impressive, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar nod. Like in a Magnolia flower, the leaves of all the characters are connected. They are all connected by their scars left behind by terrible childhood experiences. Indeed, the phrase "we may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us" echoes throughout the film. Insecurity, infidelity, regret are such fascinating themes and they are excellently explored in all of the characters. What's more, coincidence and luck play an essential role in their lives, and that makes you wonder if maybe, just maybe, the hand of God touches us sometimes.When I watched the film for the second time, I noticed the great emotional depth, the tenderness shown by all actors, which reflects on the viewer. 'Magnolia' makes you question yourself and your decisions. We all have something we regret in our past, a breaking of trust, a difficult or sad moment. Thus, the greatness of 'Magnolia' lies in our recognition with the feelings of Frank Mackey, Claudia and others. Aside from being a constructional masterpiece, this film will teach you about movie-making, about how to watch a film, and moreover about life. You just might find yourself humming along with Aimee Mann in one of the greatest emotional scenes: "it's not going to stop."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like a cross between Grand Canyon and Crash but lacking the intensity and payoff of either. That is not to say it didn't have its moments: Robards speech about regret is pearls. The Cruise performance was juicy and I loved his reaction to the interviewer pushing him for details of his childhood. Reilly is entrancing and likable throughout and Melora is deeply affecting. Seymour-Hoffman was decent but I didn't think it was his best. The rest just seemed forced to me. I just didn't buy Julianne Moore's character or her woe-is-me attitude. William H. Macy was just a sad sack as well and the whole bar scene was just a sorry mess. The child game show story just seemed like filler that dragged on and went nowhere (I get it the father was living through the Stanley) and Felicity Huffman just seemed wasted in that role. The little boy at the scene of the disturbance call just bugged. Overall, I feel like I just endured it and moved on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is an unknown gem that few have the pleasure of discovering. This film changed the way I view cinematography, script writing, directing, and the way films are made in general.Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia is an articulately woven film that flawlessly captures the emotional struggles humans face regularly while keeping you enthralled for the whole 189 minutes. The main events take place all in one day and follow many characters who are all cleverly connected in one way or another. These story threads don't ever feel forced and are all equally entertaining/ thought provoking. This film is packed with many riveting subjects with the main theme being regret. All the characters are strangely relatable even if some of them are dealing with very unreal situations. This is partly because of the casts exceptional performances. I was drawn into every one of their stories and actually cared about them as if they were real. This is the best performance I have ever seen from Tom Cruise by far. Aimee Mann provides amazingly unique and emotional songs that are scattered throughout the film flawlessly. This film is impressively written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. I will continue to be blown away by the films screenplay as long as I live. The dialogue is realistic, clever, and poetic.I am not being dramatic when I say with all sincerity that this is truly the most amazing film I have ever seen. Coming out of it I was in awe, inspired, and emotional drained. For anyone who is interested in the art of filmmaking, you need to watch this, take a deep breath, and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Thomas Anderson's towering opus to life and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the petals on a magnolia, we are all connected. Not always directly, our paths don't always cross, and like one facing north and the other south we may never know each other exist, but the emotions that we share are universal and the needs of our hearts often fulfilled just as we feel the wind is stirring and our grip is loosening. Paul Thomas Anderson's grand opus on life, pain and loss begins with vignettes on coincidence, and ultimately fate, and throughout ponders on its recurring theme that "we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us" before reaching its now legendary conclusion and having just one thing to say after 3 tumultuous hours? All we need is love.Winner of Best Film at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival, Oscar nominated for Tom Cruise's fearless performance and Aimee Mann's wonderful original song Save Me and my 26th favourite film of all time, Magnolia is a day long journey through the lives of both tortured and hopeful souls in the San Fernando Valley all seeking a connection, or redemption. Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), a good man seeking a companion responds to a 911 call for disturbance where he happens upon Claudia Gator (Melora Walters), a drug-addict and victim of child abuse whom he immediately cares for. Claudia's father is Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), popular host of long-running game show What Do Kids Know? and secret cancer sufferer with a month to live. The current whiz kid on What Do Kids Know? is Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), being used by his neglectful father and seemingly following in the footsteps of 'former whiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy),' who is suffering severely with depression and loneliness. This show is produced by Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), who is currently lying on his death bed being cared for by Phil Palmer (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a nurse desperately wanting to help track down his estranged son Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), a raging misogynist and motivational speaker encouraging his audience of men to "seduce and destroy," while Earl's second wife Linda (Julianne Moore) is overcome with regret after finally falling in love with him now that he is dying, having cheated on him a number of times and only marrying him for his money.As the tagline says: things fall down, people look up, and when it rains, it pours.Julianne Moore and Jason Robards Julianne Moore and Jason Robards Around the midpoint of Magnolia, in the audience of What Do Kids Know? a sign is briefly visible curiously reading 'Exodus 8: 2,' referring to a passage in the Bible speaking of Israel's captivity in Egypt: And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. Those who have seen this film can understand the frog reference, and I believe that its meaning lies with the feelings our tortured characters are harbouring; grief, regret, sorrow, heartache? if you can't let these go then an incredible act will help dissolve them for you. Of course there are many theories as to Magnolia's ending, and in fact it's very title, and with Anderson refusing to comment whichever you agree with is ultimately that which is correct.With every element conquered with such precision, from the acting (in particular Cruise and Moore who throw caution to the wind with stunningly brave performances), to the lively though lyrically melancholic music of Aimee Mann and Jon Brion and the cinematography, editing, writing, directing and running time, this is a masterpiece I absolutely cherish and hold in incredibly high regard as an example of the story-telling format that is film. The interwoven narratives are not used as a gimmick, but rather essential in conveying a truthful and heart-felt central theme, and the lesser attention paid to the documentary-like opening the better, as although it is indeed an outstanding sequence it quite intentionally promises a different journey leading to a different outcome than what transpires. We can't predict where life will take us, but as Officer Kurring tells us, we can "do good," perhaps leading to not only fulfilment for ourselves but love and happiness for others.Like the petals on a magnolia, we are all connected.As evidenced in Magnolia's final, beautiful shot, these connections can be life-changing.5 Wise Up sing-alongs out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is a symbol of the vulnerability of the American society today, and the hope that the future brings more optimism than bleakness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh from Boogie Nights (1997), an uncompromising and open look at the American porn industry in the 70s through the story of porn star Dirk Diggler, Paul Thomas Anderson's next film, Magnolia, a three-hour epic tale of a group of dysfunctional people over the course of one day and night, assures his status as the most ambitious and talented American filmmaker of his generation. The Academy Award-winning oil epic, There Will Be Blood (2007), his best work to date, confirms him as a modern film master, and the probable successor to the likes of greats such as Stanley Kubrick and Robert Altman.Magnolia features an ensemble cast which includes Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the more famous names. There is no leading performance here; every major role is given almost equal screen time and treatment. And each role is written so splendidly and masterfully that the characters take a life of its own, reflecting almost a whole spectrum of personalities that define people as diverse as a celebrity host with health problems to a home nurse who cares for a patient on his deathbed.Magnolia charters the paths of nine people in a small town in America over the course of one rainy day and night. Each character is linked directly or indirectly to one another through blood, shared media, chance, or past history. All of them have their own sets of problems: the fear of dying, fear of what the future brings, and fear of reprisal, as well as the loss of freedom, harboring past guilt and sorrow, and the inability to forgive. All is to change during the final quarter of the film as P.T Anderson pulls a shocker of a rabbit out of his hat, conjuring up an incredible, jaw-dropping climax of almost biblical proportions which changes the lives of these people, for the better or worse. Some will find redemption; others will find themselves more exposed than before.P.T Anderson's tale of chance and coincidence is so keenly observed that it is like numerous undiluted slices of American life interwoven perfectly together into a cinematic quilt that one can pull over and enjoy the warmth that it radiates. Scrupulously edited and filmed with energy, Magnolia is a symbol of the vulnerability of the American society today, and the hope that the future brings more optimism than bleakness. This film is a near masterpiece. Recommended! SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better movies of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the Right Stuff, this movie is flawed, but great. It has the best ensemble cast you'd ask for, delivering great performances(that's true with Tom Cruise); 9 story lines that converge into 1 major one very well; multiple themes, the most prevalent ones being chance and coincidence and the Exodus 8:2 references; emotion, humor, and beauty all around; its ability to build tension, especially towards the middle of the movie; its great choice of visuals in the set design and cinematography departments; its masterful direction and storytelling by P.T. Anderson; and its ability to run smoothly or not feel long despite its 3-hour runtime. The problem with it is that the "Worm" storyline isn't resolved, and some scenes are slow. I thought that the more memorable scenes (towards the end) were weird but pretty awesome. It's an interesting film, which isn't surprising, seeing as 1999 had many interesting films to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice capper to the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is very much in the spirit of some of the legendary films of the 1990s - sprawling, mixing surreal humor with drama, using pop music as a score, making inventive editing a part of the experience. It holds up well and, while I personally wouldn't rate it above the likes of "Pulp Fiction", I would hardly say this isn't a good movie and very much worth watching."Magnolia" is the story of a bunch of related characters having a very dramatic day and night in the San Fernando Valley. A great deal could be written about the parallels and contrasts between characters, but I think a lot of the fun of a movie like Magnolia is the viewer can notice many of them on their own and have fun thinking things out for themselves. If "Pulp Fiction" is all about the randomness of how the stories interconnect, how those intersections are purely by chance, "Magnolia" is about the incredible and meaningful coincidences that seem to be almost divined in advance. I don't think there's a lot of intellectual depth to Magnolia's fixation on unlikely events, but there's enough to make for a fun movie.The big flaw that many reviewers seem to take issue with is that the characters are all shallow. This is a judgment call that all viewers have to make, and I don't profess to have the "right" answer, but yeah, I found them mostly shallow too. Ironically, the character who shows the most depth is Tom Cruise's pickup guru, seemingly one of the most shallow constructs imaginable, who by the end of the film shows genuine emotional depth and complexity that can't be discounted. Also, I would point out that the characters in "Pulp Fiction" can't really be said to be three-dimensional, fully formed creations for the most part. So "Magnolia" is good enough for me, even if some of the key characters are a bit flat."Magnolia" works, it's that simple. I approached it with utterly no knowledge of what was in it, and I think that worked well for me. It's fun to sit there and try to figure out what on earth is going on, since the format is so clever and unexpected. Above all, this is a movie for people who are bored of formulaic drama. Whatever else it is, it's not like anything else out there.</fullReview>

Here we cannot help mentioning Moore's emotional role. This actress can impress. And of cause Cruise - he's at his best years. The second plot line tells us about a top-rated TV-show, it's creator and his family. Actually TV-show isn't something special in human activity. It's just something you do in front of many eyes. That's why it's so painful to leave the screen. Especially if you are seriously ill. The film again tells us that every profession is hard and that's the profession that helps us build our life no matter what you are: a TV-host or a housewife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all its commendable efforts Magnolia strains under the length of running time. The melancholy at times is overbearing and although the acting is first-class the film does out stay its welcome.The ensemble cast is quite exquisite and they all perform with great aplomb. Tom Cruise does enough to make comment of only because he plays an individual much against his usual character-type, and he delivers a real and powerful display.The cinematography manages to entice and enthrall the viewer in equal measure with its concerted unedited running shots and focus. The screenplay is steady, and when this is merged with the musical score the narrative flows quite nicely. However, the film prolongs its conclusion too long, you do toss and turn, and change your seating position regularly as some character arcs are not as responsive or enduring as others.Magnolia does have a lot to say, coincidence or connections being the main narrative tool. For that very reason it felt rather fancy for the film to have a prologue when it was quite explicit in Magnolia that lives were intertwined. The down-pour of frogs, a biblical reference to veer the story from the possible to the hypothetical was off-key, and much of the melancholy I believe could have been expressed in a much more cohesive structure.The best way I can describe Magnolia is as a failed attempt at greatness. It has its elements of brilliance; the screenplay really grips at times; the original use of the heartfelt song 'Wise-up' by Aimee Mann and the cast of characters is vividly memorable, the intelligent and smart cinematography and the great acting really do plant you into the world. However, the story is rather tiresome, and its running time eradicates the emotional heart of the film. I finished the film rather unfulfilled and disappointed in consideration of its patches of greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance, "Magnolia" (1999) may seam to be merely a nice film to look at. Director of photography Robert Elswit does a wonderful job in presenting the countless characters and locations. And countless they are, which explains the three-hour length of the film. The characters in themselves are extremely complex and well represented, so the viewer is never left with a boring scene. When the credits begin to roll, one might at first see no relation between the different stories or personalities in the characters, but after a few minutes of thought the thread that weaves this complex quilt that is Magnolia slowly becomes apparent.Each character has something going wrong. Frank Mackey, the horny author who wants to enlighten men on the sure-fire pick up strategy, appears to be successful and complete in his life. But when he is being interviewed, his true colors begin to show and his life is not so great after all. One story depicts a boy who is under extreme pressure from his father to get every question correct on a whiz-kid game show. When something happens and he does not want to answer the winning question, the father erupts in anger. The host of the show, whose crack head daughter takes a liking to a lonely police officer in her own story, finds out he has terminal cancer and drowns his sorrows in alcohol. The show falls apart when the host faints, and he returns to continue the show only to find that the young boy refuses to answer his question.Most scene changes of the film are separated by an on-screen weather report that seems to only separate scenes or days, but in reflection on the content of the film we realize that the weather is the only consistent aspect of the character's lives. Nothing is going as planned, but the weather does go on planned. In the end we realize, when something far from rain falls from the sky, that not even the weather can be predicted."Magnolia" outlines the utter unpredictability of life, and how we can meet some people who might change our lives completely or add to the reasons we do certain things. "Magnolia" is beautiful and long, and you might never figure out what it's about. But you'll never stop thinking about what it may be saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this film, as I had heard many complaints about the ending. After seeing it twice, I was shocked that the ending was so heavily criticized. Many lesser writers and directors would not have known how to keep the film's focus intact while such an outrageous event was occurring. Fortunately, Paul Thomas Anderson uses the raining frogs as merely a way of developing the themes of chance and coincidence, while continuing to develop the characters' story lines. On my second viewing, I was more impressed with his directing as I noticed how close he brings us to his characters, to the point where we share their emotions. I actually felt Stanley's discomfort as he had to go the bathroom, and his disappointment with the way he is treated by adults; I felt Phil's hopelessness as Linda destroyed hours of his work by tearing the phone from his hands. Sometimes though, I felt that the characters became too emotional and Julianne Moore overacts in a scene or two. Yet my biggest problem with the film was the scene in which we see the characters singing simultaneously. This scene has no place in this film, and it briefly left my detached and disappointed. Other than that, I absolutely enjoyed this film and would recommend this to anyone who appreciates ambitious film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Paul Thomas Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, Anderson's basic dramatic situations (incestuous fathers, lonely singles, children denied their parent's love and provocative material about the unhealthy aspects of hyping whiz kids on TV) are written with depth and played with such overwhelming intensity. His eye is so commanding and accurate, and every angle of every shot so perfect, that we always feel we're in the hands of a true master.Magnolia was a thoroughly life-changing experience, a rarity considering the normal fare in the moviescape. The use of music was exceptionally effective, as the music itself became a character in the movie, and a part of all the characters in the movie. The best Tom Cruise performance I've ever seen after "Born In the Fourth of July" (incidentally, it's a scorching critique of his other performances), some delicate work by John C. Reilly as a sensitive cop. Philip Seymour Hoffman also plays a great role as an extremely sentimental, gentle and hospice male caretaker called Phil Parma, who is one of the main emotional anchors in Magnolia. John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Michael Bowen, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Alfred Molina, Jeremy Blackman, Julianne Moore and Melora Walters also deliver great performances.How this movie didn't get honoured for its achievements is beyond me. Like "Boogie Nights" and "Sydney", this is a PTA film to remember. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second movie of Mr. Anderson's that I have watched. The first was the phenomenal "Boogie Nights." "Magnolia" is just as awesome an achievement as "Boogie Nights." The fact that is deals more intimately with familial relationships makes it, in that respect, a bit more difficult to watch than "Boogie Nights." The movie follows certain residents of the San Fernando Valley in a day. To say that they are in the midst of a storm is a masterpiece of understatement. The cast, many of whom were in "Boogie Nights" is again positively first-rate. And as in "Boogie Night" there is no real or structured "plot" but more importantly an observation of human reactions to various intimate stimuli as well as the culmination of those responses. The calming influence in the midst of all the turbulence is John C. Reily as a police officer who is lonely and in need of someone to love, so much so, that we become appalled at the fact, that his need of love is so strong as to cause him to make a monumentally horrible choice.Each relationship depicted has its own fabric that leaves much to be desired. If you are in to character study, this is indeed an excellent vehicle.The cast, again, is positively fabulous. We have Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, and last but not least, Tom Cruise who, generally is not one of my favorites, but his performance, actually mirrors the intensity of Mark Wahlberg's in "Boogie Nights." Tom's performance here is riveting.The movie culminates in one of the weirdest and most disturbing climaxes I've seen in quite a while. This is one of those movies where, if you smoke, you will certainly need a cigarette afterwards, as it is emotionally taxing, but no less entertaining, thought-provoking, and ultimately worthy to be included in any movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, Convoluted, and Audacious - In a Good Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly everything that can and should be said about this movie already has been, so I will just put in my two cents and skip all plot summary.This film most certainly has flaws. It is drawn out, has uneven pacing and strange unexplained events, and is at times a bit too aware of its cleverness for its own good. The ending I also found unsatisfying for reasons which can be boiled down to "inconclusiveness".But I believe that the REASON this inconclusiveness is upsetting is to the films credit. Mr. Anderson has created an incredibly interesting cacophony of personalities that somehow manage to mesh beautifully, and the viewer cannot help but get caught up in their struggles. This film is a great example of a director creating with complete freedom, letting loose with all the flair and gusto he has. Virtuosity is a word that came to mind many times throughout its towering 3 hours.Magnolia is big in many ways - its length, ambition, and subject matter to name a few; but this sheer ambitiousness of the movie in the end is its most stunning characteristic. The magnitude of confidence (cast and crew alike) required to pull off this movie, whether entirely successful or not, is most admirable, and at its best moments Magnolia could even be considered genius. Admittedly imperfect, Magnolia still manages to be a fantastic film, even if it does lose its way from time to time (and although it has been said many, many times - Tom Cruise delivers an unbelievable performance which I had not even thought him capable of, and is, even on his own, more than reason enough to recommend this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The writer could have made a big mess out of it, but was able to form it into one solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already seen several movies that try to merge different and seemingly unconnected stories into one movie and if I'm honest I must say that that didn't always work for me. Take for instance the French movie "Code inconnu: Récit incomplet de divers voyages". What happened there is that the writer had added so many different story lines that the entire movie just started to look messy and almost impossible to understand. Knowing that "Magnolia" has been written in the same way, made me doubt about the fact whether I would like it or not."Magnolia" studies the lives of nine individuals, but when you look closer, you will see that the entire movie is in fact divided into two parallel stories. One story evolves around the life of game show host Jimmy Gator. He has cancer, is married and has one daughter who no longer wants to have anything to do with him, but who constantly uses cocaine. The other man is Earl Partridge, he too is dying, he's married to a much younger woman and has lost all contact with his son who has become some kind of guru who teaches men how to get as much sex as they want. Besides these two families you'll also get an insight into the live of the current and past whiz kids on Jimmy's show, the male nurse who takes care of Earl, a nice cop,... And all the time it is raining cats and dogs (and in the end more things than that). All these people have a lot more in common than they ever expected, the only question that remains is: is this a coincidence or not?If I had to give a more detailed description of the story, than I would be writing for hours on this review. Does that mean that it is so complicated? No, not really, although you have to stay focused if you don't want to lose an important part of course, but complicated it is not. I would even say that Paul Thomas Anderson has avoided THE big trap he could have stepped in and which others didn't seem to see: he hasn't made a mess out of it by adding too many different story lines. It's all still manageable and stays interesting thanks to the way the entire story has been merged. Even though it seems like an impossible task to start watching a movie about the lives of 9 different people, this really isn't the case. It has been written so well that you'll automatically be drawn into it (at least I was) and you'll almost certainly be touched by it. And all the surreality in the beginning and at the end, you'll just have to keep an open mind towards it I guess.Of course you can also expect a lot of good acting. People like Julianne Moore, William Macy, Jason Robards, Melora Walters all do a wonderful job in this movie, but if I have to pick one actor out of the entire cast that really astonished me, then I'll not have to think twice. Tom Cruise was absolutely brilliant as the sex guru / lost son. I'm sure that the role had a lot to do with his performance, but I'm also convinced that there wouldn't have been that many actors who could have done better and who would have been able to get more out of that character. This was the Tom Cruise like I would like to see him more often.Overall this is a wonderful and touching movie that has been excellently written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. I admit that I had never seen any other of his movies, but I'll definitely try to change that. I just hope I'll not be disappointed by them after seeing this masterpiece since I might start to expect too much of those movies. Fact is that I really loved this movie and that's why I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant movie - but difficult with the (almost annoying) music in the first part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is truly a very good movie, I definitely liked it very much, the story about fate of people. You can can relate to the characters involved because they are not supermen, although they all act "weird" in a certain sense - but who is normal anyway? All characters had a unusual and important event in their past which influences them to the point when the movie takes place and keeps the story interesting to watch until the end of this (quite long) film. BUT what really annoyed me very much during the first hour (or more) and almost made me stop watching the DVD was the unsteady set of the film. For most of the time there is music during the dialogs. It doesn't change while switching from the story of one character to another character's story. After one song is over, there is a new, different song which made it to a point almost unbearable to stand ... plus the often used steady-cam which follows the persons and makes the film very hectic - even "Terminator 2" at least has some moments to calm down a bit! BUT fortunately I kept on watching, and I am sure it was is exactly the conception for the use of the music. It supports the images and the atmosphere/story, the "unsteady" minds of most of the characters - so I excuse the persistent and annoying use of the music as a stylistic device. In the second part of the film the tempo and the continuous use of music changes, it becomes more selective and literally a part of the film - thanks to Aimee Mann for some very beautiful songs. It makes the viewer more involved in the development of the characters to a more peaceful, and steady "state of mind" in the end of the movie. In the end I liked the use of the music and the music itself very much, because it gives this absolute wonderful movie its right atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've now seen Magnolia five times, and I remain convinced that it is one of the best films I've ever seen. PT Anderson crafts such a rich tapestry of human foibles that every time I watch, I find a different "Waldo." The greatest testament to his directorial genius is how he manages to control Cruise's performance. Cruise is insufferable in every movie save this one. The only time he "acts" like Cruise is when he chews up the sheets at Jason Robards' death bed. I figure PT must have gone to the bathroom and missed that part. The framing of the film in the "coincidences" sequence is a work of art. The seemingly disparate tales with no reasonable expectation of convergence (something that turned off a lot of viewers) I find exhilarating. I cry every time.MD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the End of the movie you get a really unsatisfied feeling. The story is quite static. No development of anything.It's a slow movie with some fast scenes which is a good combination. It's innovative. But the dramatic moments were unrealistic. So it's OK the Highlight of the movie is an amazing frog-rain. The intro was great. They tried to close with that story at the end, but they failed. I never felt sorry for any person.The movie does impress many people with some spectacular scenes which were all quite unrealistic and not plausible. Not because of the chances-thing, even for themselves. So I think this movie must be overrated. All in all it was pointless. It was provocative and innovative narrated, but pointless.I don't think this is a must-see-movie, but it's entertaining and interesting. Not a perfect motion picture but with a lot of good ideas just a little mindless converted. Acted very well but not outstanding.I give this film 8/10 for new innovative cinema and the beginning of a new kind of movie. (kind of)</fullReview>

Why would a woman threaten her husband with a gun, regularly, knowing the gun wasn't loaded? Why would a husband care if she threatened him, if they both know its not loaded? Why would he load the gun if she regularly threatens him with it when they argue?2. Why would they not let a child go to the bathroom before or during a TV show? Why would his "friends" force him to go up in front of people when they know he's pissed his pants? Why would the female in charge of the children, then deny she knew why he wouldn't go up in front of the audience, exposing himself? Wouldn't she instead try to fix the mess she had created? Wouldn't she try to get one of the other kids to go up? Why couldn't he answer any questions when he had to go? His brain is linked to his bladder?3. Why would Julianna Moore get so upset that a pharmacist called her Lady? "How dare you call me Lady! how dare you!" ENOUGH ALL READY! shut up about it!4. Why would a very annoying, abrasive, callow junkie, ever go out to dinner with an intrusive goody too shoes bible thumping cop who has zero charisma, and won't leave her house and who clearly annoys her very much?5. You don't lose a modest amount of intelligence by being stuck by lightning. You don't go from being a genius to being a normal guy. Totallyillogical.This is just a sampling. The movie was depressing, disturbing, dark, and impossible. None of it made sense.This movie was three long boring hours of unbelievable characters, saying unbelievable things, and doing inane, illogical things.Zero out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 out of 10Maybe I just don't get it, but I thought Magnolia was a very, good film, and another solid piece of work by Paul Thomas Anderson. However, I'm in the minority in that I can't score it above an eight. Tom Cruise was outstanding, which goes against the grain because I think he's an overrated actor. He does shine here, showing versatility from his alpha-male speaker to tension during his interview. Also giving top-notch performances (in no particular order) are Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Melora Walters, Jeremy Blackman and William H. Macy. I especially liked the chemistry between Reilly and Walters. Yet the movie can drag at times. I thought some of the dialog between Jason Robards Jr. and Philip Seymour Hoffman slowed the movie down, although the movie was quick for fitting on two VHS cassettes (the movie rental place was out of DVDs at the time!) What irked me was it felt like I was force-fed Aimee Mann. Her version of "One" playing at the beginning of the film while the characters was just irritating. I can't stand milquetoast remakes of old songs, and they plopped one in. It felt like neighbors making too much noise when you're ... well ... trying to watch a movie! I also felt that the scene where the actors were singing along to one of her songs was forced and unnecessary. Mann has been a critics darling for years, yet she can't make more than minor waves to the public since she was in Til Tuesday! Obviously the powers that be for this film are in the former category. Still, overall solid work. Anderson hits a triple after a home run with Boogie Nights. Reilly and Walters should work together again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable and straight-forward film about coincidence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A critic once said about Magnolia that it was a movie where "Director P. T. Anderson just wanted to masturbate all over film." The same thing was said about Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo." It could been seen that way since Tom Cruise, William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are given surprising tasks in their performances... as if it were planned to take the biggest actors and have them do very out-of-character things. It can also be given that criticism because the film is over three hours long with continual shots of beautiful cinematography and subtle film tricks.The tone of this film is somber and reflective. As each story unfolds, each character has made a grave mistake or was "at the wrong place at the wrong time" and takes the rest of the movie to work over it and/or reflect upon it. While all this does not sound like the most interesting storyline for a movie (with no brainless action sequences like Fast and the Furious), the dialogue and the chain of events will keep you glued to the seat. Yes, you will have to "think", but if you are that ignorant of meaningful language you might as well stick to the action movies because this movie is not for you.What must be taken into account is that this film is based on the interesting facet of life called "coincidence." In fact, the film opens with three weird stories, all very remarkable, all interesting and immediately to the point. From then on it sets a tone that weird things do happen at the strangest of times... but sometimes they aren't as surprising as they seem. The story of Magnolia is based on this concept, and with the fact that you have more than seven different storylines going on at once, three hours is a minimal amount of time to display such a story.I won't go into exploring all the storylines as that would take up too much room, but I will credit the film in many cases. First off, the pace of the movie is fantastic. It may seem slow, as many P. T. Anderson movies tend to be, but they are always with poignant moments to keep your attention. Just when you want to nod off you're brought back by another coincidence or intense image. The acting in this movie is some of the best in film history. Each actor gives the best performance they can muster with their given lines. Sometimes you are so caught in the emotion of the performance that you're caught with your jaw hanging open.The dialogue in this movie is incredible. A friend of mine once said that P. T. is able to take the most mundane of conversations heard in reality and screw with it to become an amazingly poignant speech. Magnolia is filled with this. The lines are believable while at the same time off-the-wall, all contributing to the overall madness of this film.There are moments of utter insanity. P. T. is a master of tension, and it builds and builds to the point where you cling to the seat, just wishing the end would come. This is like Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream's" climax except the tension is wrought out longer and more excrutiating as the sequence of events coincide with everyone's storyline, making it a long, drawn out process of breakdown. Every character is driven to the edge, every character is holding back, the rope holding the bridge is on its last strand. By the time the climax hits, you're drained, and the events that occur slowly loosen you, like a drawn-out orgasm.Not to be forgotten, Aimee Mann gives this film a wonderful tone. Her voice and her music blend in perfectly, carrying the song through its rough edges and reflective tone. Her song is even sung by everyone in the movie, a very important moment to note.Three hours long with excellent... everything. Many of you will be turned off by having to listen to words the whole time and make sense of things but you must realize there is nothing to figure out, this is no puzzle of a movie. It's all clearly placed for you to see for yourself. There is no mystery or game behind it, there's just a lot of unexplained symbolism and social extremities that you must bear through in order to see just how beautiful this movie is. Give yourself a day where you've slept fine, have a nice dinner, call up a friend or see it alone, just be comfortable and let yourself be taken into the environment P. T. wants to present. It's a breathless three hour trip into the weird events of life and the consequences of our life, as well as the validity of our very existence. Remarkable. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episodic, elegant and brilliantly performed portrayal of life, love and death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: PLOT SPOILERSP.T. Anderson's episodic ensemble drama really is a piece of work. It is a complex, sprawling and gripping character study of hope and destiny. Perhaps it is a bit too strange for the mainstream audience though, and the film isn't flawless.The storyline is that on one day in Los Angeles, the lives of loosely connected people intertwine and interact. The film only vaguely remains true to this plot. There are really only two ends of the story (the Partridges and the Gators) and in the end there is no real link between the two families. At the start of the movie, we see some unusual coincidences that occurred in the past. So the film is supposed to be one long coincidence from start to finish. But the conclusion needs a bit of figuring out and even then it is still a bit unsatisfying.Over the three hours, there are there are eight or nine different plots. All of these are equally entertaining and engrossing. When one plot reaches a climax it switches over to another plot. This keeps you engaged to the actions and wondering what will happen next. The only minorly disappointing plot is the one involving Jason Robards grieving over his inevitable death. This seems a rather soap-opera like and drags on a bit too long. But the strength of the other plots, the originality and unique quality prevent the film from going to far into the realms of TV movie hell.The large ensemble cast work brilliantly together and are well suited to their roles. The most impressive is Tom Cruise as the shallow, arrogant, misogynistic and just plain b***ard sex-guru, Frank T. J. Mackey. Julianne Moore character is a depressive, gold-digging, hysterical and unstable woman. For most of her scenes she is complaining and being paranoid, which is a shame because she gives a terrific performance. I'm surprised she didn't get an Oscar nomination. John C. Reilly probably has the most interesting story and gives a very humane performance as the unloved cop. William H. Macy is brilliant is the disillusioned ex-child prodigy. Jason Robards and Philip Baker Hall are both very good as the distraught, dying sixty something-ers. So the acting standard is indeed, outstanding.The directing styles are strange to say the least. The film starts out as a humane, lightweight and occasionally humorous slice of life. Then it's a drama about disparate people finding a meaning and a place in life. It then escalates into a heavy-handed tearjerker focusing on family relationships. The film finally climaxes with surrealness and a minor degree of horror. These odd directing techniques never quite blend in and the overall effect is uneven. However, this does add to its memorable and one-of-a-kind atmosphere.The film's ending isn't bad, but doesn't make a huge amount of sense and isn't so much an explanation but rather a surprising conclusion. As you can see, the film isn't perfect but flaws are inevitable. The more you think back on it, the more sense it makes and the more you'll probably like it.Overall, I think that `Magnolia' is a brilliant and highly memorable movie. It is an unusual movie experience and for a three-hour movie you don't feel the time going by at all. It should have won the Best Picture for 1999 instead of the blatantly manipulative and much overrated `American Beauty'. I give Magnolia 8.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed like in a Bosch painting or a Dali dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not that the three hours passed quickly - they really didn't - but I was mesmerized the whole time. It was like not only watching, but being contained inside a painting by Bosch, the Medieval "surrealist", or a dream in the head of Dali, Bosch's 20th century equivalent. Everything in the film - the scenery, the characters, the events - had a heavy scent of higher truth, of outlining the world as it really is.No, I'm not sure that the world according to director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson is more true than anyone else's - but his vision is portrayed with such clarity and emphasis, it is definitely true to him, and believable to us others.We get to follow the absurd situation of several characters, and how their drastic fates get interwoven. It's a sophisticated plot, indeed, which could easily turn it into more of an intellectual construction than a story of flesh and blood. It doesn't happen, though, and don't ask me why not. I guess it's simply too well told.Usually, the writer and the director being one and the same, lessens the end result. When a story is to be realized - on stage or on screen - it gains from the natural conflict between writer and director. Already there, a struggle is introduced. Anderson is one of the few to pull it off - which puts him way up there among Bergman and the like.But can he repeat his feat? I wonder. The width and depth of Magnolia rather suggest that he has, by this movie, told all the stories he had in his head. I hope I'm wrong.</fullReview>

Technically spectacular, and beautifully made, with outstanding performances from every single member of the ensemble cast. It's sprawling, and lends itself to the criticism that it spreads itself to thin. Instead I admire it's ambition, and consider it remarkable that such a massive effort could turn out so cohesively. It's not going to satisfy people who need a film to resolve itself in a nice little package, especially in the now famous climax. This scene, along with several others, while strange, capture the true nature of what cinema is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart and Dignity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson is an enigma to me. On both the MAGNOLIA and BOOGIE NIGHTS DVDs, he comes off as incredibly inarticulate and unenlightened, even in clips showing him directing. I keep thinking that there's no way that anyone who seems less intelligent than your average twelve-year-old could make such brilliant movies, but perhaps that's why in part, the characters in his films are so appealing. Take for example, the cast of BOOGIE NIGHTS.What they lack in depth and intelligence, they make up for in heart and dignity. It is heart and dignity that inevitably, make his films work and makes them fault-proof. One can claim that Anderson is overly ambitious, indulgent, or long-winded, or even not as 'deep' or as clever as some people like to think he is. There might be a slight ring of truth to all that but inevitably, to fault him for those reasons is like complaining that your spouse loves you too much. People originally flocked to see BOOGIE NIGHTS to see something about the porn industry. What they ended up seeing was a film about everyday people who have a great deal of charm and dignity, despite their obvious flaws. In MAGNOLIA, Anderson takes us further, back into our roots. He shows us how we have the same needs as adults that we had as children. Those needs are simply, love and respect. Those who don't get enough love and respect usually end up unable to love others, and are unable to respect themselves. This is certainly no deep philosophy. Yet lots of people are messed up all the same, so there is something to the idea of showing it in a variety of ways that are not preachy or didactic. The problem is, often when a director reaches out to an audience's heart and imagination, there are going to be more than a few people who will go on red alert. We get manipulated to feel all sorts of mush by Hollywood. Is this just another trick to pull our heartstrings in artful camouflage?I shudder when I read people complain about how Jason Robards "rambles on" on his monologue. It is certainly not comfortable to stare into the face of a dying man as he agonizes more over his lifetime of insensitivity towards others than over his personal physical pain. Perhaps those people are finding that "insensitivity" too close to home (?). As Anderson shows us, it isn't easy, and it certainly is "messy" (to quote one reviewer here), but we should be grateful that Anderson shows us the untidiness and the occasional lack of cohesion that is life. This film is a cathartic poem, and an opera, which is an audacious thing for a film to be. Because of the low-key acting and the pure simplicity of the action, the film feels realistic. But if we paid attention toward the beginning, we can see that we are being told a fable. Coincidences and odd situations sometimes blend into real life, or at least exist in such strong parallels in our imaginations that it is within the laws of fable-telling (and opera) that one may step over the boundaries of "legitimate" storytelling. So a scuba diver may die in a tree, people may break out of the boundaries of conventional storytelling to sing, and an aberrant rain could fall from the sky. The rule that has not been broken or abused in this film is its theme of dignity. Where most films in Hollywood like FORREST GUMP reduce human dignity to a philosophy that can be summed up on a bumper sticker, this film creates a whole canvas of the human condition. Some characters seem a tad overblown, but if one is looking closely, one can see their whole life and how it came to pass that their condition came to be so extreme.The film starts off with the song "One is the Loneliest Number", but we are then given the opportunity to see how our lives do connect, both directly and indirectly. We are not individuals lost in the wilderness. That is what the film is saying. It is simple, but it is pure in its sincerity. In the midst of individual despair, there is a collective consciousness that can be either destructive or cleansing. Perhaps it will take something like an "aberrant rain" to make us realize just how much whatever falls on each of us, falls on all of us. But watching and enjoying this film will do that just as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb editing, good performances, and Biblical allusions do not add up to a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie twice in 24 hours, not that I liked it so much but more because I kept dozing off in between and I wanted to check out if I missed out something that was profound or integral to the movie. This is my first and only P T Anderson movie. While I did notice that much of the film revolved around the Bible's Exodus 8:2 (82 on the hanging scene, 82 on the plane, Exodus 8.2 on the street signs, 82% humidity?and finally the frogs) on my second viewing, I could never figure out why this film's script HAD to use the word `f..k' nearly 200 times. Will Mr Anderson answer that one? Especially when the film's leading character the police officer Jim is vocal against the use of foul language and appears as an antidote in the film to excessive use of foul language. Would the film have been less powerful without the profanity spewing out of almost all the characters (including the fat boy on the quiz team)? I found it interesting that Anderson liked to make the film revolve around Exodus 8:2, while another great American director Terrence Mallick made his `The Thin Red Line' revolve around another Biblical verse-1 John 4:4 through tattoos and dialogues in his film made 2 years ago. Actor John C Reilly was a treat to watch in both these films, another common factor between the two movies. As a director, I prefer to watch Robert Altman's cinema?he has more panache than Anderson, (compare Altman's `the Wedding' or `Nashville' with `Magnolia', for instance). Altman has been more successful pulling together diverse situations with a common thread to provide a cinematic essay on a single subject.However, where the Anderson film scores almost a perfect 10 is in the handling of editing of sound and visuals. Take the sequences of Stanley answering the question on Bizet's `Carmen' followed by `Carmen' playing in Claudia's house. Brilliant I thought, but hold on--there's a minor flaw. Claudia could not be playing Carmen-it does not fit in with her character or lifestyle-it is evidently Anderson choosing to play `Carmen' on the soundtrack to suggest a parallel love story and connectivity between the situations. But is it a parallel love story between Jim and Claudia that is emerging? I don't believe it is. The flaw is not in the editing; it is in the direction. Anderson is intelligent and a cut above most Hollywood directors but he does not belong to the class of Mallick, Kubrick or even Altman. There are other such visual editing and sound editing examples (coffee being thrown out by Jim immediately followed by Gator being offered a drink, conversation of previous scenes continuing over other visuals) notable for their intelligent use of the craft. I cannot say if they were the contributions of the director or entirely that of the editor-but in any case the editing was top notch. The use of Richard Strauss's `Also Sprach Zarathustra' to introduce the Tom Cruise character was good but what's new? From Kubrick in his `2001'onwards, dozens of directors have used this aural metaphor. Yet his use of Aimee Mann's songs were good and effective-(again Altman did better with the use of Leonard Cohen's songs in `McCabe and Mrs Miller') but did Anderson have to have all the characters singing along with Aimee to underline the linkage between the characters? Somewhere, Anderson is not confident of communicating and has to use tacky methods to convey what he wants to say-which is what Mallick and Kubrick would not do. There were vignettes of the film, which I thought were absolutely lovely. They include the long shot of Jim the policeman (John Reilly against the police car) over the young black American's head in the foreground, the policeman dropping his baton in front of Claudia's door, the conversation on `difference between children and angels' at the bar. The performances of late Jason Robards (his last role), Julian Moore (the lady looked evil spewing out profanities), Reilly as Jim, and Melora Walters as Claudia, Tom Cruise, Henry Gibson as Thurston Howell, April Grace as the TV interviewer made the film a worthwhile experience for me. Hats off to the editor Dylan Tichenor and the collective sound department. I am sure we can expect better cinema from Anderson and his team in the future but `Magnolia' the flowering tree and the film have not impressed my senses in any exceptional way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quiz kid:-A perfect film"That is correct"Soundtrack by Aimee Mann. Magical. Tom Cruise:- Stupefyingly good. Julianne Moore:- Better than ever. Everybody else:- Outstanding.I cannot find fault with this film. It has been put together with the care, passion and artistry that a parent would lavish on their child or a young man would give his car.It is an intelligent film, with a magical quality that American Beauty despite winning a Best Picture award does not even come close to.It is a portrayal of human emotion, within its extremes of duress.By rights it should have won every academy award it was eligible for. But life is harder than that. Magnolia will explain this better than I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up the DVD of this movie used a day or two ago, and finally watched it last night. This movie is so full of amazing performances, it is a CRIME it didn't win Oscars for the actors and actresses involved. And I loved the frogs. They had the perfect touch of coincidence, absurdism, and fit the themes and ideas of the movie in a way that just -worked-!In spite of it being 3 hours, I felt that this was just an amazing movie, worth sticking it out. The "payoff" at the end was real - not cheapened by some cheesy or simplistic moralistic lesson, but real. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! BEWARE!!!I've seen this movie once and it ranks up with my absolute favorites. I saw it in the theatre a while ago and couldn't take my eyes off the screen, although i could hear the complaints of other people in the seats behind me. Up front, you should know that this movie is damn long, and that it's not for everyone (not that any movie really is, I suppose). Afterwards, in talking with friends about this movie, I heard comments as varying as the comments I've read on here. One friend mentioned "What was the point of that movie? Everything's interconnected? So what?" Another friend thought it was amatuerish and far too long. Another was excitedly talking about it for weeks after having seen it, still trying to unearth things she didn't notice initially. Regardless of what the reaction was, it definitely succeeded in eliciting just that, an emphatic reaction, from everyone I spoke with. Which, in a time where some may think we've "seen it all," is something worth noting. It deals with many extremely unhappy people in extremely depressing situations, but it is no way a depressing movie. It's ultimately a movie of hope. And while it's obvious that it's overall message is that of redemption and forgiveness and acceptance of our individual lives and everything that's previously bothered us, as well as the importance of owning up to the lives we've led before we can wholly move on to better things, it's told in such an unconventional way by today's standards that it gets lost for some.As far as the length, I figure there are plenty of movies out there that DID get edited down to a more readily acceptable length. Hell, somebody had to leave everything in to see what would happen. And while there, why not just go all out? I completely respect and enjoyed everything about this movie for not in any way (that I can see) giving in to the idea of what "should be done." Instead it seemed a work of passion. In regards to people I've talked with who couldn't make any sense out of the frog storm, I've said a few things from what I could figure out: Firstly, it's in the bible, which is made obvious throughout the movie by conveying the exact passage countless times to the viewers. If you have a problem simply with the frog storm, it's not with the movie, it's with the preivous book. Secondly, some people I talked to asked why the hell it had to be "frogs"......why not just a gigantic thunderstorm? To that I answer "I don't know." And I don't think anybody should know. If anybody did, it would ruin the effect of the event itself, because it's origins could be traced back to something human and/or earthly and 100% explainable without the existence of another higher power, so to speak. I saw the storm as a big reminder to all the characters in the movie who thought their problems were more overwhelming than any other problems imaginable (which would be pretty much every character). A reminder that, regardless of how bad it might seem to be, there's still something out there beyond our comprehension that/who is watching us and basically letting us know it's okay.......we're not that badly off. Frogs make no sense in the realm of logic, but logic has little to do with faith. All this said, I'm not really extremely pretentious or "arty" or any of that crap. After all, I loved "Happy Gilmore," too. And I guess in the big picture, I usually like a lot of stuff that does what it does wholeheartedly, without pandering or second-guessing what others might like, and stays true to it's focus, whether it's making the longest most message-filled darkly funny movie you can, or the cheesiest dumbest movie you can. Or, in other words, yeah, I liked Magnolia lots and lots.</fullReview>

It is filmed with such sweeping passion, such oddly nuanced grace, that I was willing to overlook some of the nastiness in the handling and the long sections of talk that really don't tell us anything. The acting by the all-star cast is terrific (particularly John C. Reilly as a dedicated cop who wants to be loved), Aimee Mann's songs are haunting, the production is flawless, however it's a difficult picture to sit through.

Brilliant performances by all involved, especially John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, and Philip Baker Hall.Though many people have trouble with the ending, the movie justifies that strange coincidences and strange events happen all the time. (Another strange coincidence: at the time of this comment, Magnolia is rated 8.2 and ranked #82 in the IMDB Top 250. The Numbers 8 and 2 feature prominently in Magnolia.

		<shortDescription>The Best movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year of beautiful, elegant, powerful films Magnolia stands as the most beautiful, elegant and powerful. Having experienced this film twelve times in th eTheatre and immediately purchasing the dvd upon it's release I feel confident enough to state that movies do not get much better than this. It has exactly what movies should have; believable characters, real situations honest emotion. Every character is somebody we all know or know of. The movie unfolds slowly not allowing ourselves to gloss over the complexities of the characters. P.T. Anderson has made a film that is unabashedly personal, not just to him but to his audience. Many people in my life live with the regret of things gone wrong. "The book says we may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us." These words should be heeded. Words as true as those are rarely heard on screen. For those who dislike the length go and Dude, where's my car which clocks in at below 90 minutes and will not challenge you in any way. Pearl Harbour has just been released and it clocks in at just around the time Magnolia did and yet offers none of the beauty and magistry of P. T. Anderson's directing. Magnolia will forver stand as a movie that people were just not willing to enjoy beacuse, perhaps, it hit a little too close to home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular, although I see the "language" issue has bothered some people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything, I'd like to thank 39 steps (see below) as I'm going to take a similar approach. Rather than de-construct the film (and I gave it a 10) I'd like to ask the audience some questions. First, however, I'd like to address the "language" issue. You can either accept that some people actually DO use the "F" word and slang terms for genitalia and go on and enjoy the film, or avoid it. If that aspect of reality disturbs you, you have the right to avoid the movie (movies these days DO have ratings, so don't complain about such things as though you've been victimized).Anyway, some questions: Ever heard of quantum theory; the interconnectedness of all things? You might want to read "The Holographic Universe" then go back and watch the movie again. Perhaps the simultaneous singing part won't trouble some of you so much. As others have cited, the "Sins of the Father" message was pretty strong throughout the movie. I see that's caused some religious discussions. Fair enough. So now then: Ever seen something happen that you cannot explain? Ever seen two people pick up a large person or object using only two fingers? I have and I know others who have, and to this day I cannot explain it. Strange things DO happen all the time. Ever heard about discoveries of scientific significance that happen simultaneously at several places around the globe without any contact between the research groups? Ever seen someone heal another person? Ever seen or heard of spontaneous disappearance of a tumor? I have. How does that happen? I don't know and neither does my aunt, but it happened; overnight. Western medicine and science is at a loss to explain most things. The physical models we build in an attempt to understand life and the universe are just that, man-made models. How many times in the past has science and medicine been proved wrong? If any of us think we have all the answers, then we are without hope. Perhaps there is a reason for everything that happens and we simply cannot understand the reasons for some (or all?) of them.As Dennis Miller says: "That's just my opinion. I could be wrong".Peace.</fullReview>

It's real people on that screen and unlike Anderson's talent as a film maker they're far from flawless.

		<shortDescription>Stands out from the crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A large number of excellent films were realised in early 2000, yet this film stood out from the crowd from day 1. It takes great bravery to write a film which incorporates raining frogs into a story of people living their lives, and absolute mastery of filmmaking to present it on screen without simply producing laughter. Paul Thomas Anderson pulls it off with genius.The directors previous film ("Boogie Nights") was a comedy that wasn't very funny, with sections of emotional pain for the characters that was heartbreakingly portrayed and perfectly presented. Magnolia ignores the humour (in the main, though there are lighter touches), and concentrates instead on heaping misery on the heads of its lead characters. Once again the acting performances are uniformly superb, and the audience suffers with them.Each of the performers lives up to the standards they have set themselves, and Cruise goes above and beyond anything I expected of him. The stand out performance, however, comes from Melora Walters, as Claudia, who has been criminally ignored in the acclaim for Cruise.All the Anderson flourishes are in place (long tracking shots, montages of different characters who are apart and yet together), and the add a great deal to the film. Stand out moments? Frogs, it's not going to stop till you wise up, quietly judging, confusing being sick and in love.Truly a great film.</fullReview>

All that I can say right now is that M is an amazing, highly recommendable movie.As for the discussion about the alleged overuse of the "f word", I find it bizarre (and very American).

It's a movie that you must have faith in, just like the characters in the movie that have faith as their only option. If you stick with it, and pay attention, and don't bitch because it's too long and doesn't have a zany jive-talking cyborg sidekick, if you're willing to USE YOUR BRAIN, it will pay you back in spades, I promise you.

		<fullReview>I give it a ten for a few reasons. Its very good basically. I've never seen a film that is so perfect cept maybe "Life is beautiful" and "American History X". I get the feeling that I could talk for a few pages and still not get close to descibing how interesting this film is. I won't though because there are plenty of reviews here for you to look at. I'd rather explore the best points of this film as I saw them. Ok it is very unexpected it takes you right from the start and really makes you think. I sort of knew about those two stories described in the first scene so I think that surprised and impressed me that they used real stories. Then you get into the grit of the characters. And its real grit from real people. They make big stuff ups and you can really identify with the people in it even though I've never had a husband dying of cancer or been addicted to drugs or LOL have frogs fall from the sky. It has no weaknesses in short people who give bad reviews have not really seen it. I really think you should rent this one and sit back one evening and relax and give this a good look. I had the privilege of seeing a DVD in a theatre and the sound came through big time. I really love some of the soundtrack and after the first song by that women I was so so pleased that they got her to sing another two. I'm going to go get some more of her music. Incomparable. Heck those songs are worth the price of the rental. Do go to the toilet before watching this because it is long. (you'll see one of the morals of the story is also go to the toilet earlier rather then later) LOL anyways it is not to long. I almost groaned when I heard it was as long as it is but like everyone said its totally captivating and is very well broken up with nice gear changes and scene changes. Wow you will be surprised by this.</fullReview>

A movie about the need to love, and to be loved, and, to be saved. Magnolia reminds us that we are all connected in this world. We are not alone. And, as Claudia's smile tells us as we listen to the closing song, we can all be saved "from the ranks of the freaks who suspect they could never love anyone." In short, Magnolia is a movie about everything that matters, and it is, in my humble opinion, not just one of those things. No, it is not just any movie. It is, dare I say it, the finest American movie since Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

No performances can be singled out more than another, but you will be surprised at how much Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore can REALLY act.

		<fullReview>So frequently, movie-goers, myself included, will describe a movie as being 'a waste of time'. Sometimes it's a fun waste of time, sometimes a horrible one, sometimes a pointless one, etc. And then there are movies like 'Magnolia', the exceptions- indeed, the very antitheses. Here is 3+ hours sitting in front of a television that is anything but a waste- 3+ hours of life that serve to enhance the hours afterward. 'Magnolia' is a meditation on life- one of the few movies to seriously shoot for that goal and one of the fewer still to achieve it. Each and every one of the actors give terrific performances, the ties between them bobbing and weaving until it all falls into place, merely great cinema humming along between moments that spark and flare and illuminate in ways seldom seen. May Paul Thomas Anderson always be as inspired and observant as he is now. 'Magnolia' is a marvel.</fullReview>

It brought tears to my eyes in the scene when he meets his father (the late Jason Robards) for the first time in years, and says what an awful man he was. The same thing about William H. Macy. I've always loved his performances in movies like Fargo and Pleasantville, but this was his best performance by far. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore were my other favorite performances.The only thing wrong with the movie is they cursed way too much. Even more than a normal person would. The only one that has an excuse is Tom Cruise, because his character is really sleazy. It just went way over the top. But even that is a small problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could be forgiven for thinking that Hollywood is out of ideas. They just seem to be remaking old tv shows or old movies. Worse Still they spend $100 million on special effects but nothing on a script. That is how I felt until I saw Magnolia, Hollywood has something special in director Paul Thomas Anderson who will go on to become one of the most original and greatest directors of our time. Rarly has a film been so rich in dialogue and character, a cast to die for and after seeing this film the characters stay with for so long and how many times can you say that about films today? You will laugh and cry with Quiz kid Donnie smith and the policeman who falls in love. Nobody in this film are heroes and nobody says and does the right things at the right time its simply like watching life unfold in all its glory and tragedy. Its a shame to hear some complain of the 3 hour running time but I strongly believe in this world of fast action editing that many people no longer have an attention span and it is a great shame because this is a beautiful movie and one which you will remember for the rest of your life. Tom Cruise even acts in this one!!! 3 hours of your life well spent 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever, perhaps the best - and for the ones who didn't get the frogs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm visiting IMDB.com very regularly since quite a time, but I never felt like commenting a movie myself, until I've seen Magnolia, it's unlike any movie I've ever seen.I thought it to bee quite like American Beauty (called after a flower, too!), and before I've seen Magnolia I really liked American Beauty. But compared to Magnolia, American Beauty is too soft, too harmless, too shy and too commercial. Magnolia is like a punch into your face (by the way: it has it's name because of the colors beige, red and brown, these are the sad colors of the flower called magnolia and the most used colors of the movie), it shows the real sickness of our western society, how un-self conscious we use to be at the beginning of the third millenium and how unsure our future is.The writing, acting, directing and the music is almost perfect, there is no scene I really don't like. A lot of people complain that it's three hours long. I only realized this the first time I saw it because I had two hours planned in to see this movie and actually would have had other stuff to do, but I just couldn't stop watching this movie.And for the ones who didn't get the frogs: (*** minor spoiler warning ***)What do you think it feels like when you realize that your life is nothing more than crap, when you realize that you have problems which are so old that they seem to be petrified, when you realize that you have been running against a wall for so long and didn't even see it and that you have wasted such a lot of time? This feeling is scary, sad, depressing, incomprehensibly and somehow surreal. That's what the characters are experiencing at the end of the movie. And now, what do you think is it like to see thousands of frogs falling from the sky, spilling their blood right at you? - It's quite the same. So you see, the frog-rain is a perfect visualization of the inner breakdown of the characters and their lives. It's the central scene of Magnolia and it's my favorite movie-scene ever."So Now Then": Did it ever rain frogs for you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't often that movies like this come along. Magnolia is one of the best films of 1999 because of its original characters, ideas, and twists. The only other movie of 1999 that comes close to Magnolia is Three Kings. Magnolia is something special because it takes you into the character's minds and emotions like no other film of recent years. Many people feel the ending was too far-fetched, but if you pay close attention during the movie, P.T. Anderson, the writer/director is setting it up brilliantly. The whole movie you were anticipating something spectacular to happen and I feel that the ending was completely satisfying. It was so nice to see a writer/director make a movie about something. Magnolia has a human substance to it that no other film in 1999 had. Everyone can relate to all the character's different emotions. As far as the ending goes, it was simply amazing...and that is what Magnolia is, amazing. Pay close attention during the movie for the numbers 8 and 2, and then, ONLY AFTER the movie, go read the Bible and look at the Book of Exodus, Chapter 8, Verse 2...that might help explain the ending if you don't understand it the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Paul Thomas Anderson's third feature is by far his best, and is by far the best film of 1999. The basic plot outline doesn't do the film justice, a group of people from different walks of life endure an amazing day in the San Fernando Valley and through the course of the day their lives interconnect and have some sort of influence on one another. Hardly enthralling viewing, you might think, especially given the film's indulgent running time of just over three hours. The real strength of the film is in the great ensemble cast, many of whom starred in Anderson's critically acclaimed "Boogie Nights" (1997), amongst them William H Macy (surely one of the greatest actors of the moment), Julianne Moore, John C Reilly, Ricky Jay (who also narrates the film) and newcomers to Anderson's world, the late Jason Robards Jr and a great performance from Tom Cruise, in surely his most outstanding performance to date. It's such a shame he had to resort to the dirge that was M:I-2 afterwards. Still, money talks. Anderson has already shown that he will be one of the greatest directors since Stanley Kubrick, with such dazzling visual flair and technique and the ability to choose the right actor for each part.Faultless (never have three hours flown by so quickly), Magnolia will surely go down as one of the greatest American films of all time; of course, the academy largely ignored it (I still think i is a better film than "American Beauty") nd if you haven't seen it, please make sure you do. On no accounts let is slip by you, or you'll miss the movie experience of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't anyone get the frogs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoiler alert! After seeing this movie on video, I was amazed at the symbolism &amp; all the things I missed when I first saw it in the theater! I was so overwhelmed with the performances &amp; engrossed in the emotion &amp; there was so much going on that it was easy to let things go by.The frog scene was incredible! The first time I saw it it was so absurd yet eerily plausible, especially in light of the beginning prologue of seemingly "coincindental" occurences, that I just started laughing. P.T. Andersen's dark sense of humor definitely shines through &amp; is obvious throughout. This was a wake-up call to the characters that was pregnant with symbolic meaning. A friend of mine who saw the movie referred to frogs as ancient eastern symbolism for spiritual rebirth, which was definitely happening to each character after sinking to the depths of despair &amp; realizing the need to be unstuck and move in a new direction. Each character was so caught up in their "reality" that they couldn't see beyond their petty existence &amp; needed a "sign" from the universe, or god or whatever. There are no coincidences in this world. Everything happens for a reason.Also, the biblical reference to the plagues of Egypt was not lost on this reviewer. There was even a direct reference to the frogs in one of the game show scenes where an audience member is holding a sign with the biblical reference to the plague, which is quickly taken from him by a staff member!Which brings up another theme. . . the game show, which symbolised the games the characters were playing in their lives to live up to others expectations. The flashy, psuedo-happiness expressed in the game show belied the seriousness happening below the surface.Sure, there were excesses in this movie but P.T. is an excessive guy and L.A. is an excessive, surfacey, neurotic place full of vice as well as virtue. You just have to dig deeper to find the virtue than other cities.Although I adore Aimee Mann &amp; her music I thought having the characters all singing "Save Me" at the same time was both corny yet so brilliant a move that I could forgive P.T. for doing it. You can definitely say it has never been done before!Ever notice the use of Paul Thomas Andersen's initials of his first&amp; middle name &amp; how it is a reference to a well known circus owner? Just remember "the greatest show on earth . . . must go on" &amp; you will have greater insight into P.T. Andersen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a wile, movies don't get the recognition they get. A perfect example is the annual oscar-event, several years ago. Titanic won, but a few years later, almost everyone agrees that it was LA Confidential that should have won. With this movie, it's the same. Though it wasn't nominated for best picture, I think it should have been. It's fairly difficult to make a drama without being soggy. Magnolia isn't soggy at all: it's more creative then the most drama's. The most critics share my view, and I'm glad dat it did get SOME recognition. I never saw The Cider House Rules, so I can't determine if Tom Cruise should have won the **** Thing he was nominated for, but he sure did well as the charismatic Frank TJ Mackey.The music is beautyful too. Aimee Mann has the ability to create songs which match the scenery perfectly and add an extra dimension to the acting, the story, and the plot. I was a bit sceptic about this movie - it seemed so exaggerate a whole bunch of livelines - but seeing it took away my scepsism. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Magnolia' is too long, in fact it lasts about 3 hours. Everyone (except maybe Kevin Costner) knows movies tend to get tedious after 120 minutes. There are far too many characters, too many sprawling storylines tenuously held together by two men dying of cancer, creating a lack of focus and leaving many loose ends. At one point the whole cast, for no apparent reason, start singing along to the soundtrack. The self same soundtrack features Gabrielle's 'Dreams' for chrissakes! So how come Magnolia works?Paul Thomas Anderson's latest ensemble melodrama doesn't cover the same timespan of 'Boogie Nights' but is more eventful and emotional; and despite all the things listed above, it is essential viewing. The film follows several characters through one day in San Fernando, documenting their lives, loves and losses. The element linking all the storylines together are two men, both dying of cancer and seeking forgiveness for mistakes they committed during their lives. However, Anderson includes many threads that are only weakly linked to this idea, all brought together under the umbrella of bizarre coincidence.Isn't it great when Tom Cruise acts? I don't mean onscreen flashing his perfect smile and tossing his flaxen hair. I mean really acts. Like in 'Rain Man' or 'Born on the 4th of July'. Or 'Magnolia'. His performance here reminds you why he is a cut above the average Hollywood crowd-puller, though I wouldn't say it was outstanding. This is not because he isn't brilliant, rather that the rest of the cast match him every step of the way; despite not being household names, writer/director Anderson knows he is privileged to be able to cast some of the best actors currently plying their trade and they will nail their given character perfectly.Despite Gabrielle's dirge rearing it's ugly head, the soundtrack is otherwise excellent, and Aimee Mann's songs seem to match the events perfectly. In fact, in the album inlay Anderson admits to having written Magnolia to fit Mann's songs, not the other way around. Unusual, but like so much else about the film, it works. So not perfect, but thoroughly recommended, even if just for the scenes with the frogs.</fullReview>

What is the significance of raining frogs? What did it have to do with the gameshow host's daughter's drug addiction? Or the quiz-kid's attempt to steal money? Two emphatic thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an outright masterpiece. Anderson possesses a mastery of the movie camera, as well as an insight into human lives and emotions, like no film-maker today that I can think of (I was disappointed that he missed out on an Oscar, but he's too talented not to be honoured eventually). It's difficult to watch at times, with several painfully intense scenes, and at 3 hours possibly difficult for some people to see through to the end. 'Magnolia' is, however, so ambitious, accomplished and rewarding in so many ways that it should be seen by anyone who appreciates and believes in the power of film. Compare 'Magnolia' to at least 80% of American films being made today, and they just won't measure up. It will probably require a second viewing in order for you to fully appreciate the beauty of the script, themes and characterisation, as well as the brilliance of the direction, photography and editing. A lot of viewers may think 'Magnolia' is too harsh, or long, or grim, or pretentious, or even offensive, but it's a truly beautiful and compassionate film which must be seen to be appreciated.</fullReview>

The music mostly composed by Aimee Mann touched me deeply and was perfectly in place...

		<fullReview>If Paul Thomas Anderson is still around making movies in 10-15 years, I have a feeling that he will look back on the excesses of "Magnolia" and say to himself, "what was I thinking?" He may be technically precocious, but he doesn't yet know how to write interesting dialogue, develop believable characters or discipline his actors. I haven't seen so much hysterical over-emoting since the dear dead days (hopefully) of John Cassavetes. This film is three numbingly monotonous hours of mawkishly profane psychodramatics, written by someone who can't put two sentences together without using the "F" word. Everyone in this movie talks the same way, even the children! Everything in "Magnolia" is too much: there can't be one character dying of cancer, there have to be two and they both have long "I cheated on you" speeches. Tom Cruise might have won the Oscar for the scene at his father's deathbed if Anderson had given him anything to say beyond "I hate you, you (expletive deleted)." As it is, Cruise is forced to flail about desperately in the worst awards-pandering manner. The same is true for just about everyone else. Julianne Moore plays another of her frazzled druggie roles so amateurishly that it wasn't till I saw "The End of the Affair" and "An Ideal Husband" that I discovered that she really could act! Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard many things about this movie before seeing it, mostly good, and having enjoyed Boogie Nights, I was anxious to see this movie. In the interest of fairness, though, I knew that this movie was so highly rated by critics and IMDB'ers alike, so I watched this movie with a hypercritical eye. It may result in some nitpicking that you might find silly. Deal with it.It is interesting, then, that so many people gave a movie such a good rating. When a movie as plot driven as this one is (the characters are all written so one-dimensionally, the actors are pretty much interchangable with one another), the script becomes as important an aspect as any other. Yet, the story arc is uncommonly forced, moving from one segment to another with an awkardness generally reserved for Jean-Claude Vann Damme films. Characters seem to be so focused on a bizarre goal, to close their own story arcs, they act completely out of sync with whom they are supposed to be (I think that even the cop in The Village People can tell when his date goes to the bathroom for ten minutes and comes back pinching their nose, asking for a second date is not the proper course of action). With so few characters and such a long movie, you would think that the director could keep track of his people better, but they appear and disappear with alarming regularity, in order to set up for an ungratifying ending. Of course, with a film that is this well liked, plot holes automatically become stand ins for angst ridden college age analogies. No doubt the precubescent rapper in the beginning of the movie had a vague enough role that he can stand in for any one of a number of irrational theories as to the directors motivations, from third world labor strife to schoolyard violence. Free Tibet, anyone?As for the actors, Tom Cruise wastes the choice role handed to him as the informercial whore. Jobs like this scream for the shameless over the top treatment, but Cruise chooses a low key point of attack instead, seeming to deliver his lines with a sleepy intensity that makes him seem more an actor than a crazed cult leader. If L. Ron had this little charisma when giving one of his own seminars, we may have been spared the car wreck that was Battlefield Earth. Waifish actress Melora Walters seems to have been chosen by the bounce of her breasts in an opening sex scene rather than any real acting ability (she's quite talented in that regards) It's the actors that are coming in for another go-round, the veterans from Boogie Nights, that fare a little better. Juliane Moore doesn't need to know what her characters motivation is (because the viewer certainly doesn't) as she flips off her lawyer. And, you might not remember John C. Rielly's performace in Boogie Nights (hint: it wasn't that good), but he slips into his role of an insecure policeman so well, I had to be wonder if it was the same person. The luck ran out for poor William H. Macy, who just seems lost in his role as a hard luck closet homosexual. Seeing him fighting for a bartender's affections is an almost painful experience for someone so talented.The bottom line? If you have not seen this movie yet, please don't let my review stop you. For all the things that I wrote, I gave this movie an eight out of ten, a solid showing for such an ambitious project. But, folks, put the oscars (they lost their proper noun status with me after Matt Damon and Ben Affleck each got their copies) back on the shelf. There were more deserving films than this, and this director still has more room to grow yet. Lets see what comes up next.</fullReview>

Paul Thomas Anderson has quickly become one of my favorite directors, and with only three films under his belt he has created three masterpieces.Magnolia is three hours long, yes, but i could easily watch this movie every day without ever getting tired of it. It amazes me the things that p.t.anderson does in this film that i haven't seen in any other films. And i can't forget to mention the beautiful camera work as well.This is a movie that you can't miss. The beginning grabs you, because of it's originality and slight humor and then the movie never loses your attention, until finally bringing you to one of the most original conclusions to a climax i have ever seen, and it is a scene that you will most likely never forget. And i almost forgot, great acting as usual by the standard pta cast members, and tom cruise at his fathers house is an amazing performance.This film is worth three hours of your time, and it is one that i will always keep in my collection. I will continue to watch it for years. "...like the book says, we may be done with the past, but the past is never done with us..." **********</fullReview>

Besides these small problems, The movie is a masterpiece.It focuses on many stories of different people, the stories themselves arent related, but go together well.You feel sorry for the people portrayed. The film is three hours, and a lot of viewers felt that they just wanted to get it over with, but its seems the three hours are justifiable. A thought provoking film.

		<fullReview>Hard to tell anything in short about this movie. It has some of the Altman's "Short cuts" (or, for French readers something of Lelouch in the style) in its form but goes well well beyond in its way of interlocking people apparently having nothing to do with one another. Also where Altman films, with a hint of humour, facts and people in their every day life, PT Anderson tackles with not less than... the bible : his characters all facing such a heavy event in their life that God himself will allegedly interfere at the end of the story. PT Anderson does not entirely avoid the reproach of having been megalomaniac and too extreme in the choice of its characters. But if you are aware of this and willing to get over it, this movie is one of the most amazing EXPERIENCES that, as a movie amateur who sees tons of films, I have ever been through. It is not just about a story but also a complete universe (that is buried in our sub-conscience), an atmosphere that is unique and yet close to us, crawling human beens on the face of earth. The film is one of the rare occurences of a realist story that somewhere happens in the twilight zone. See it : you'll either detest or love it, in either you'll think about it and about yourself afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the quality of DVD's and my new big screen TV and complete DTS cinema sound system, I've started buying DVD's from america without seeing the movie first, i reckon ?6 of the price would have been paid to go to the cinema anyway, and if i don't like the movie i can always trade it.With Magnolia i decided to get the 2 disc version here in UK, it got delayed by about 3 weeks, but i eventually got it, though immediately sent it back due to the poor packaging. Ordered the american version, got it 3 days later, and loved the packaging. I hyped this film up to myself, i even got the soundtrack, before even hearing a single song. SO basically added on top of the critics' praise, my respect for Boogie Nights, and my struggle for getting it on DVD, this film had a lot to live up to.What did i think then? well the 1st 10 minutes really excited me, i knew there was an unforgettable climax, it obviously had to be a culmination of all the stories, it couldn't be the rain thing, becasue i knew that was going to happen.Anyway 2hrs 30 mins in, and i like it, although i was expecting some surreal moments, but didn't get any - people site the singing along to 'Save Me' as weird, but i didn't, it fitted well into the context, and i thought it was very original. THe film has good pace, but the truth is that none of the stories are really original or amazing, we've seen it all before, but PT ANderson seems to make the stories individual and at least refreshing, and he directs with style and the screen is always a pleasure to look at when he's behind the camera.30 mins towards the end you expect this big culmination, and to me the 3rd act is what defines a movie, the 1st act should get you interested (it did) and the 2nd act should be entertaining and have purpose (it did) and the 3rd should end everything, leave nothing unanswered and show you something you didn't expect (yes, but...) and with the very best movies, the film will carry on even after you've left.I didn't really get bored during the 3 hrs, but i did feel rather dissapointed at the end, sure the rain is unexpected to those who don't know about it, and it sure as heck is exciting to watch - but it doesn't really serve a huge purpose apart from being unexpected, it does affect some of the people, but not to any great extent. Some of the stories just conclude, and that's it, there's no big climax, no big hurrah for the characters, and it becomes a film that just ends, even leaving little things unanswered.I hate it in movies when the credits come up when you don't expect them to, You should know when a film is about to end. American Beauty won best film oscar, it had an amazing 3rd act, and it moved a lot of people, i can't help feeling had Magnolia had a stronger 3rd act, it could have been a favorite of mine, as i hyped it up to be.I'm one of those people who kinda got it, but not really, the movie is still playing in my head 2 days after watching it, and i feel i have to watch it again, to put my mind to rest, maybe i'll love it, second time round, as is the case with many movies.I kind of feel the 1st 10 minutes are there to make the rest of film move quicker, because your mind is expecting something, so you take everything in and think about it. If the 1st 10 minutes weren't there, the film could have been quite unexciting, but at least you wouldn't feel as dissapointed at the end of it all.in conclusion, if you happen to come upon this review amongst the many others (richard E.Zwick's excellent comments on the front page sum it up for me) and want to know whether to watch this film -- it's not a complete waste of time, if like me you generally like movies as a whole, from the corniest family movie to the die-hard drama type movie, then you'll find the 3hrs fly by, and it leaves something inside of you, part annoyance and part happiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to tell you one thing. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. This movie is the BOMB! Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest screenwriters and filmmakers that I have ever known. And, someday, i hope to see more of his work. This film is funny, touching and human. It tell us about all the ups and downs about life and how people go through life physically and emotionally, how they take downfalls. And, how they are in a situation where they are lonely and have no one to talk to. for those of the other bozos who think this movie sucks or they think it is b.s., YOU THOUGHT WRONG!! This is my all time favorite movie. I'll bet they are more prone to watching kiddie flicks like Toy Story or Bambi. Those jerks. Anyway, I strongly recommend this film to anybody and by the way, if you are ever depressed or feel lonely or ever feel suicidal, this IS the movie for you. These are the kinds of movies that help heal pain. KIDDIE FLICKS LIKE TOY STORY DON'T!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant tale from a brilliant filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the fan of contemporary film as I am, Magnolia along with Hard Eight and Boogie Nights clenched the fact that director Paul Thomas Anderson is my favorite director. He is a hard-hitting film magician. If you think long and hard enough about the techniques he uses you can figure out how he did it. The mystery is how he thought of it. Of course he's been influenced by Scorsese, Altman, even Tarantino, but adds the gloss and refuses to weed out any scenes that most producers would deem unworthy. And that's what makes great filmmakers great. It would be criminal not to mention the incredibly strong performances by a gifted group of actors. I have always been open about my fondness of Julianne Moore, and here she lays it all out on the table until she's out of breath. Jason Robards is heart breaking as a cruel old man coming to his end. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the nurse just trying to help. Tom Cruise is vicious as creator of `Seduce and Destroy.' William H. Macy is touching as an original ex-boy genius who now can't even remember to remove his key from the lock. The current boy genius, played by newcomer Jeremy Blackman, is a child very few people like, even if he's one of the sweetest kids you've ever come across. Philip Baker Hall is the game show host who has worked well with children for thirty years, except his own. Melora Walters is surprisingly brilliant as the drug addict who always has tears in her eyes, as she uses sheets on her windows to hide from the world. John C. Reilly is the clumsy cop trying to do right and falls in love. Magnolia is not for everyone. It's strong, quick, and unlike any other movie you'll ever see. While making the dramatic comedic, and the comedic dramatic, he rarely lets us forget that this is a movie about the strange things that happen to the characters. Their stories and parallel lives weave in and out of each other's in a stretch of 24-hours (3 hours, movie time) ending with a most unpredictable event. Wild horses could not get me to reveal it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Pynchon Of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where "Boogie Nights" found Paul Thomas Anderson's encyclopedic knowledge and dazzling cinematic technique covering up his disdain for the hapless denizens of his porn netherworld, "Magnolia" finds Anderson openly embracing his cross-section of Los Angeles citizens and teaching them about the goodness of the world he sees before him. Anderson's speed-demon style is well at work here--it's as if there isn't enough celluloid to fit it all in--and the depths of his topics are layered and full; he's the Thomas Pynchon of film and one viewing surely isn't enough. Like Pynchon, he can't quite grasp saying "when" and the film is a very long three hours. Still, the viewer has plenty of rewards, from the looniness of Anderson's script (the end has to be seen to be believed and one has to have embraced the film long before then) to the magnificent performances that make one feel as if life is truly being lived in front of the camera. Everyone shines here but special notice must be given to Tom Cruise who finally realizes his potential and turn in a bravura, funny piece of acting as a public speaker making a career out of humiliating women and embracing all things misogynistic. Cruise rises above his (previously) competent abilities to deliver an unwavering, if ultimately touching, performance that is both well-suited to his talents and challenging at the same time. Other great moments are provided by Julianne Moore (treated with far more respect than Robert Altman ever showed her), William H. Macy (getting back at Anderson for his underwritten "Boogie Nights" role), Jason Robards, Jr. and Philip Baker Hall. Anderson's themes of sin and redemption, chance and destiny and the power of love are, at this dawn of a new millennium, welcome and timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three hours of length, a lot of stories to follow... at a first look "Magnolia" seems to be a very "strong" movie, probably too much long and boring. But then when it begins with that astonishing introduction, ti takes you in a world full of despair but with a final possibility of hope. The cast does a very great work: the apparently strong Cruise, the suffering Moore and Walters, the good man Reilly but most of all Philip Seymour Hoffman with his sweet Phil and Philip Baker Hall with his Jimmy Gator, a man destroyed by cancer and sorrow. Anderson gives us a very effective portrait of these lives with a strong screenplay and a fantastic soundtrack,. One of the most beautiful movies of the year.

		<shortDescription>Three hours of unpleasant stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia takes three hours to describe some very unpleasant things that are happening to people which are either unpleasant or pathetic or both. This does not make for a very entertaining three hours. The film starts off O.K. with a prologue that shows several cases of unusual deaths that feature near incredible coincidences. After that the film introduces about a dozen characters (probably more) and we follow their lives throughout that day. The characters are grouped into about four seemingly unrelated stories. So far so good. What I was hoping for after this is that all the characters and their stories will somehow come together at the end of the film perhaps even through some incredible coincidence - like those that were presented in the prologue. But, it seems that this is where my expectations of the film were too high. The stories do turn out to be connected although VERY loosely through a set of most UNremarkable coincidences. Basically it feels like 3 or 4 scripts for short films artificially pasted together. It is true that certain stories mirror one another showing similar fates with different outcomes, therefore contrasting one another - but on the whole all of this is quite unremarkable. The style of the film here resembles some of Robert Altman's work only without the elegance and without the humour.But the movie, just before the end, comes up with one stroke of originality. The EVENT happens. It is something quite unexpected and in sharp contrast with the realism of earlier events. The sequence showing the EVENT is powerful and visually and audibly compelling. But (and this is a big but) it is completely unrelated to everything that's been happening in the film and on the whole has very, very little effect on the fates of the characters in the movie (the EVENT kills one character but he had been dying anyway).But the film's biggest problem is that it is about people that would get on your nerves terribly if you met them in real life. Most of them are b*****ds and those that are not are so pathetic you couldn't talk to them for five minutes without screaming. There are only two sympathetic characters in the film - the cop and the nurse. The moral of the film seems to be about forgiving and understanding - but by the time we get to that we had to sit through three hours of moaning and unpleasantness.However, to end on a good note, the characters (annoying though they may be) are quite convincingly portrayed by an excellent ensemble cast. Most of them are well established character actors who give fine performances seemingly effortlessly. The standout, somewhat surprisingly, is Cruise who gives by far and away his best performance to date as a self-centred, misogynous seduction instructor. Also excellent are Julianne Moore and Phillip Seymour Hoffman - whom I hope we will see more of in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Although there was good acting by Tom Cruise and some others, it wasn't enough to save this film. The camera literally moved so fast I had trouble focusing at times - the plot jumped around and seemed to go nowhere and the ending was .... so incredible baffling that I still can't figure it out. Tom Cruise was good in a unique roll that I was surprised he accepted. Although I heard he is considered a supporting actor in this film, he seems to be on screen a lot - (this does help the time go by faster). There is some really good acting in this film but unfortunately the plot is so awful that it's lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after seeing this movie it was stuck in my head for a few days, it's extremely haunting and at this very moment I still have Aimee Mann's voice going through it. Some of the best movie's ever seen always have great characters that stick with you through time and this movie certainly does that. Everyone seems so intrigued with the frogs, as they should be, it serves a really big purpose in the movie but they shouldn't be the main purpose as everyone seems to be stating it as, it's the message that the movie's trying to send about regret, love, hate and the way we all treat each other and of course about how things just happen that's important, but I'll never forget the scene when Earl was talking to Phil about regrets and Lily, it was the most intense speech I've ever heard. Yeah this one is recommended. Oh by the way, how come everyone that has something negative to say about this movie is so hostile towards positive reviewers? Just an insight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't pretend to completely understand the entire story, but I can tell you how I viewed it. OK, I'm 12, got that over with. I think that Magnolia is a very deep, very twisted plot with a lot of intricate characters and very real quotes, you know what I mean? It gives a feeling of calm confusion, or at least it did me. Some people try to pull out one simple lesson or meaning from the story, but the best way to watch it is to kind of take ALL of the meanings in. The plot sounds very confusing when you read it, but believe me, the movie has plenty of time to go through and explain it. Also, don't get too hooked up on one of the sub-plots, or you'll miss the rest of the movie. Trust me- I've got personal experience. If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it. If you don't understand it, watch it in a while and see what happens. It's worth your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one to just hand this compliment out to random films: _Magnolia_ is the closest thing to a perfect film I have ever seen. I went to the theatre to see it and was so completely blown away that I returned the next night to see it again.There is really not a single bad thing about this movie. The cast, which includes familiar names like Julianne Moore and William H. Macy and lesser knowns like Melora Walters and Jeremy Blackman, is just spectacular. With the sheer size of the cast, a lesser director would be unable to effectively tell the story (in fact, this happened; see _Beautiful People_) yet Paul Thomas Anderson has a uncanny sense of timing that juggles the various plot elements perfectly, so that the entire film flows into one story, rather than nine.Speaking of the story, the script itself is top-notch. Besides being engaging (three hours fly by like 90 minutes), there is an important message to the film with complex social, religious, and philosophical implications. Even better, the movie isn't preachy! You actually have to discover its theme for yourself and decide what each of the characters got out of the film. While some may not appreciate this, I find it highly commendable in an era of hit-you-over-the-head, blatantly obvious, socially conscious films that bombard the audience with already apparent (and self-important) messages about an easy topic like sexism, war, etc.A common objection to this film is that it is long. Well, if you sat through _Titanic_ or _The Green Mile_, this film should not seem long at all. Unlike those films, _Magnolia_ actually uses all three hours and eight minutes of its screen time.There's not much more to be said. The only down side is that it will be nearly impossible for Mr. Anderson to follow this one up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A matter of chance" vs. "those things happen all the time". magnolia is first of all a film about film-making. the introduction with the three murderers of greenberry hill - accidents, chance? well-filmed for an accident. suicide: the film stops, and neat little drawings are put upon him. arbitraryness in life, reflected in the film: the line is continually blurred. the stories: we all know them too well. the dying father wants to see his son for a final meeting, donnie seemingly lacked the love of his parents and now has too much of it, frank is the role-model of chauvinism, the good cop (it´s a dirty job but someone´s gotta do it) etc.etc. the first hour of the movie is a hard test for the audience. anderson keeps dragging clichés to their limit, points violently at the conventions of producing emotions out of celluloid, before he can go beyond the cliché, just before one really has to leave the cinema because of all these stereotypes making your eyes and mind bleed. This technique is also mirrored in the editing, which is just about a second faster and therefore steals the next expected picture of the scene away after the general theme of each story is established. I think realising the film´s awareness of being a movie increases understanding and fun, for otherwise it is really too much story and facts. try and look again under these premises. first act for cognition, second for sublimation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have all noticed how lists of great films of all time (e.g. AFI's list) tend to have a predominantly older group of films. It seems as if it is a requirement to be 25 years or older to gain "classic" status. With that in mind, I think that this film will age like a fine wine... moving it's way into greatness over the next century. Fifty years from now "CyberEberts", or critics as we now call them, will be discussing whether this film changed cinema forever.Magnolia is utterly unique in it's complexity and layered structure. Altman never did it this well, as great as he is. What Paul Thomas Anderson has done in this film will be legendary when we are all gone. The acting he can pull out of his "repeat" actors is outstanding. Cruise delivers in the role he will be most remembered for... Walters is a standout as the lost little girl we all want to take care of. Reilly imprints his reputation as the best supporting actor of the decade. Moore has played this role before, but she does it so well... and William H Macy is the only one who could pull off Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.The soundtrack is haunting... Aimee Mann may never produce better work. PTA chose her well, as well as he chose everything else. This film is by far the best of the year, and along with Schindler's List, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction it will go down as the most influential of the decade.This film shows you things you've never seen in ways you've never seen. The boldness of the "sing along" scene, along with the breath taking ending will leave it's mark on you and on Cinema for a very long time.There are no weak links in this tale of family, forgiveness, redemption, coincidence, lonliness, connectedness and hope. PTA's kinetic camera is a joy to watch and I recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a willingness to be taken places they never knew existed.This film is like a deep image poem of the 60's and 70's, it may not make sense immediately... but it will make you feel something even if you don't know what that something is, and someday, down the road, it will all click into place for you.This is a masterwork that all should see. At three hours (such as Titanic, Braveheart, English Patient and The Thin Red Line) some have said it is too long. I just wish it had been longer.This film requires a lot of thought and an old soul. Those who love "film" will love this future classic.99/100 A+ ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May be 30, 40, or 50 years later when the next generation (or the one after that) looks back to our time -- I believe this is a film that we could proudly put forward as one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history in our time.Several quick points. First: Aimee Mann. Her songs and her voice are incredible. The sing-along, which could have been so disastrous, turned out to be such an amazing and powerful beauty on the strength of that haunting "Wise Up." Second: the ending. It's absolutely wonderful. Yes it's a freak accident -- but it perfectly illustrates the stories of people's lives: interrupted, savaged, and ripped apart by "divine interventions," they nevertheless march onward, with a resoluteness that is only matched by their despair. Third: Tom Cruise. What a powerful performance, especially during the interview and on the bedside of his father when he breaks down. Kevin Spacey -- you are not even close. Fourth: the structure of the movie. Many other had commented on this already: it's a slowly blossoming Magnolia, each of its petals slowly reveals itself to us, with incredible pain and heroism.If you still haven't seen it, go see it. And buy the soundtrack CD too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Breathtaking Film Experience for those of us who aren't perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAGNOLIA is a heavenly slice of filmmaking. Paul Thomas Anderson of BOOGIE NIGHTS fame makes an even more compelling and revelatory feature than his previous two outings. He adeptly handles a day in the life of a dozen or so seemingly disconnected people. Not only does he spin the stories wonderfully together, but he draws some of the best performances out of a major studio production in a long time. Tom Cruise gives a jolting, crude, and ultimately heartbreaking performance as a chauvinistic sex guru. It is surely his best performance, and one that was deserving of the best supporting actor Oscar. John C. Reilly continues to shine in Anderson's films as the God-fearing, love-hungry cop who provides the movie with its emotional balance. Last but not least, relative unknown Melora Walters delivers a raw and emotionally powerful performance as a heroin addict trying to cope with the guilt and shame of her family's secrets. She is what gives the movie its emotional impact.This is truly not a movie for children or casual moviegoers. However, for all those interested in serious filmmaking and top-notch acting, MAGNOLIA is a masterpiece to behold. With wonderful sing-along music provided by Aimee Mann and the most bizarre and exhilarating concluding plot device ever seen on screen, MAGNOLIA finally unravels itself to expose humanity in its most naked and exposed state, as well as to discover redemption "for the freaks who have never loved anyone."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Sure Just Why I Loved It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie not knowing that much about or hearing many reviews about it. I'd never talked to anyone who'd seen it, and all I new was that it was about people with connected lives, and that it was supposed to be great. I put it in and began watching, and soon after the mood tone and style of dialague began, I simply dismissed it as an artsy fartsy piece of crap. I watched it to the end though, and afterwards simply felt it a waste of time. I waited a day, and began thinking that it couldn't have been as bad as I thought. I figured it must have something more to it than what I got(which was nothing). So I decide to watch it agian even though I felt I might be wasting my three and a half hours all over again, I began watching, and I decided to pay close atention to evereything and everyone and every word they said.As I watched, I realized just what I had done wrong the first time I watched. To understand this movie, you must first pay strict atention to figure out what is going on, and try and understand why characters are saying and reacting just the way they are. Every line a character speaks, you must understand what they're going through, or what has happened to them in the past that would make them the way they are. Many reasons people might quite understand this movie are things like William H Macy's character the former whiz kid who wants braces like a bartender he sees, and goes on and on about love(what love is, what it feels like, and how he has it to give). People may see him saying in the movie that he has love to give and say to themselves " What the heck does that mean." Now I won't say just what it means, cause someone who hated this film may read this, but if you don't understand, watch this movie again. Try and understand what things mean, what emotions the actors are tyring to convey. Just what each character has had happen to them, and if you begin to do that, you will love this film. Actually thats what I had the most fun doing during this movie was puting it together in my mind piece by piece. After doing this, I began to notice other things about the film. Just how wonderful each actors performance is in this film. While Tom Cruise was nominated for best supporting actor, I really felt many of the other actors equaled his performence. Not to say that his was bad, its just that everyones job was so wonderfully performed that simply the emotions of everyone were so real almost to the point of bringing tears to my eyes. I also noticed how wonderful the soundtrack was. Aimee Mann did a fabulous job at creating a haunting and beautiful mood to the movie that was emphasized at the key parts and incorporated into the film.*Spoiler*(I think)For those of you who have seen the movie, a quick word about the frogs. After watching it the first time and already looking down on the movie, the frogs added to the confusion. But after the second time, I understood that the frogs were no there for any particular purpose because they were frogs, but to show how such a random and mysterious happening can bring some together, and make others get a hold of their situations, and understand just what there problems are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I watched Magnolia the first time {on video} I wasn't sure if I liked it or not... I was tired and the 3 hours kind of got to me... So I took it out of the VCR and simply went to work the next day...All through the day the film was burning a hole in my head... I couldn't wait to watch it again, but I still couldn't explain why...Why was I fascinated so intensely by it. I spoke to others who've seen it and they were all ho-hum about it. And here I was about to give my shift up so I could see it again. Then I watched it again. I found myself constantly rewinding parts of it so that the film prob. took me an extra hour to go through... But I found myself actually a part of the movie.. it enveloped me. It joined with me. The characters have pretty bad lives going on at the time and then they all hit rock bottom. Its happened to all of us. There's just no farther down to go, so you think. So you resolve to make a change, to take control of your life. Its in your hands, right??? So you join in singing with them... You tell yourself to "Wise Up". You finally take contol of your life, and you try to fix it, but it still gets *messed* up. You tried, and its even worse... It happens. It just happens. And maybe it takes an act from God like *things* falling from the sky (ha, no spoiler) to set things right again. To join us together, when we can't get it right no matter how hard we try and want it to be... That's why I think this movie speaks to me. Its about ALL of us. All of us are dying, or taking care of someone who's dying, or want to die because of what others have done to us... We've all been abandoned, we've all loved those who don't love us, we've all wanted to be loved... We are cast members in this film. Try it. Watch this film. Then watch it a day later. Get the soundtrack. Play it in the car while you're going to work. I dare you to tell me that you don't feel like your in the film... We all are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not only the crowing achievement of a brilliant film maker (Paul Thomas Anderson), but is one of the best stories I've ever seen brought to life. Cruise delivers a stunning performance of a desperate man. John C. Reilly, as always, portrays his role without flaw. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards work beautifully portraying the bond and emotion of a nurse and their patient. Paul Thomas Anderson never fails at satisfying his audience, as well as surprising. With every character having depth, growth and true emotion.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys emotion and beauty while watching films (or if they just need an apocalyptic wake-up call). This is easily the best film of 1999, and in the top 10 of the 90's. If you enjoy P.T. Anderson's past work (i.e. Boogie Nights, Hard Eight), this film is a must. All in all, every actor delivers, at the very least, a stellar performance. I Give This Film 9 1/2 Stars Out Of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but history is not through with us." I understand that P.T. Anderson is rumored to be very arrogant and you know what? I don't care! He is one brilliant film maker. In Magnolia we see a massive undertaking, that holds many lessons. Most important of the messages is that of karma. The mistakes you make now will come back to visit you later. Dying alone is a great tragedy and as Anderson shows, can sometimes be brought on yourself. Some might find the stories depressing, however the power of forgiveness is always there. Some have complained that Anderson might have bit off more than he could chew, but I disagree. The movie is long, but also beautiful to watch. The performances are superior to any you have seen in the last couple of years. Robards, Moore, Cruise and many more were all worthy of Academy awards. The movie is not for Stallone and Julia Roberts fans, so be advised. If you want trivial nonsense, rent something else. Like other Anderson films, as you watch the film over and over, you will pick up new things each time. Do not deprive yourself of Anderson, he is an American GENIUS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, exhilarating and draining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are too many reviews that describe the story to compete with (and if you don't want the movie spoiled, don't read them.) This movie features Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, William Macy among others in roles you would never expect to see them in, and done brilliantly. If you are looking for a movie that has substance and Really different, skip the theater and head to Blockbuster. I regret missing this when it came to the big screen. Though running at nearly three hours, you may be grateful you can pause it to run to the bathroom. However, you won't be able to turn it off once it's started. This movie accomplishes what would seem an unlikely task; taking several very sad stories and making a surprisingly life-affirming statement. One jolting feature to the movie are the characters openly expressing thoughts that today's American would deny even having, making a doubly damning comment on the Hollywood sludge machine of slick cynicism, and our society in general. (If that sounds syrupy, don't bother watching the movie.) One of the most original movies I've seen in years, and one of the most draining. At three hours, plan on setting aside your evening to watch it. Nine out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAGNOLIA is a magnificent piece of art.Like Andy Warhol shaking the camera while filming a beach to tell us: "Hey, it's just a film", Anderson explicitly makes clear: "If that was in a movie, I wouldn't believe it", emphasized by some fantastic surrealisitc scenes.But the abusive father-child relations of MAGNOLIA, ranging from sexual to intellectual abuse are reality, they are happening. The extreme set of characters employed forces the audience to consider that reality.Non of those "middle-class-suburban-family-with-blond-twelve-year-old-daughter-being-hara ssed-by-some-weird-ugly-guy" sort of 1980s bullshit-reality-TV movies could ever convince anyone of the brutality of paternal abuse.By creating a piece of art, fiction at its very best, this film shows again: If you have to tell a terrific story, use terrific characters, terrific actors and go where just few directors dare to go. Naturalism was in my eyes never the way to make an intellectual claim about the world, but a vast majority of films never goes beyond methods of "real life".I hope MAGNOLIA sets a new trend for movies of the beginning decade, realizing the unlimited unrealized opportunities filmmakers actually have. So give it a couple of awards and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie, and oh my god, after the credits started rolling, I just seriously wanted to go mental and choke somebody. What were they thinking???! I want that 3+ hours of my life back, that this stinkin' movie stole. When the beginning rolled out and they had all these urban legends and coincidences, I thought this movie was going to be so cool. And scene after scene of these characters and what they were going through were okay, even good -- I have to admit it some of it moved me. But come on! How can something that builds up to such emotional impact suddenly turn on something as stupid as the ending?? After hours and hours I really wanted to turn that thing off, but watching it is kind of an investment: you think you'll get a big payoff of a climax, and when it seriously DOESN'T, you start going psycho. I do not get what the big deal with this movie is, it's NOT one of the best movies ever made, and all this pretentiousness should NOT trick people into thinking it was. By the way, Tom Cruise's performance was not groundbreaking, practically any other actor could have done the same job: it was just a big deal that this pretty boy started cussing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That line is first uttered by aging game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) in Paul Thomas Anderson's epic character study `Magnolia.' Hall's character is the first of several to make this loose and indicative religious quote in `Magnolia,' a film so emotionally complex, alarmingly twisting, and arrestingly original that it should be marked as the last truly great film of the 1990's.Pinning down a two-sentence summary of the plot is almost impossible for a three-hour opus of this magnitude. It is seemingly plot-less and runs on and on, without any real inevitable `goal' associated with most films. It's basically (and I use that term as loosely as possible) an exercise in following a group of people living in the San Fernando Valley and absorbing all the love, loss, regret, and wants that they're experiencing. As mundane as that appears, `Magnolia' is so inventive that it towers to become much, much more than it sounds.Being a movie with many diverse characters, it includes a very fine-tuned ensemble cast. Among the characters are those trying to give their compassion and help the helpless in a heartless society, like police officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, in a flawless performance) and caregiver Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman). There are those who are trying to find some basic respect in life, like Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), the 10-year-old prodigy of a kid's quiz show called `What Do Kids Know?' and Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a former contestant of the very same quiz show who has gradually become a spineless has-been who's place in life is obsolete.There are those who are at death's door and fighting to redeem a life full of lies and failure, such as wealthy television producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards, looking quite dead) and Jimmy Gator, the troubled host of the aforementioned quiz show. There are also characters who feel lost in their own pasts, like Claudia Gator (Melora Walters, in a startling breakout), a burnout cocaine addict who is so shattered and trapped in her own history that she instinctively shuns almost anyone who tries to introduce love into her life. There are wives who parallel each other; one, Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore), having a change of heart about her dying husband; the other, Rose Gator (Melinda Dillon), blissfully unaware of her husband's infidelity.And there is Frank `T.J.' Mackie (Tom Cruise, in the most limitless role of his career). Frank is a sleazebag who teaches seminars to men in hotel ballrooms on how to `seduce and destroy' any woman they want; the amount of initial ambition and pretension in the character is scary.On top of these main players, there are yet more. These characters do not belong to the story, they are the story. The film opens with a surreal examination of chance, a theme that sets us up for the series of occurrences and collisions that take place between all these people in the day the film takes place.It would be criminal to go into the film in any more detail, for the turmoil, psychological manipulation, and powerful sequences it holds need to be experienced first-hand. Seemingly owing something to Robert Altman's 1993 L.A. study `Short Cuts,' the elements of divine intervention, dread, desperation and care in `Magnolia' make it a much different and much more affecting work.Director, writer, and producer Paul Thomas Anderson is emerging as one of the most creative and articulate forces in Hollywood. The 29-year-old one-man-army behind `Boogie Nights' and the overlooked film noir `Hard Eight' pieces together something flawless out of what seems like nothing special. Anderson seems to have a knack for building impressive, cohesive ensemble casts, and this is certainly no exception. He takes bold, unapologetic chances with the writing, chances that pay off. Anderson also develops a very distinct style with `Magnolia;' the pace of the film seems very urgent, like a friend rushing to tell you some grand payoff of a story but patient enough to let all the subtle, creeping details sink in.A very compelling element of the film is the soundtrack, almost all of which is tackled by the brilliant songwriter Aimee Mann and her sometimes-producer Jon Brion. Mann's sharp music lends a stunning vulnerability to the story, but Anderson is not content at just dropping songs into his film for atmosphere. Mann's songs actually helped Anderson to compose some of the characters in the story, and several songs are used to very poignant and unique effect at key points in the film; just another innovative step `Magnolia' takes towards cinematic perfection.Other critics may point out that `Magnolia,' clocking in at almost three hours, is too long, too vague, too pointless, or too unorganized to even bother with. Yes, it is long, but it feels like the film would be much less if it had scurried along to complete some evident purpose as fast as it could. It helps that it does not have some set course to travel along either; we can't see where it's going or even why at points, and if we could it would surely be a less interesting journey. Not one scene seems boring or out of place, partly because of the life and blind audacity that the cast leaps into their respective roles with, partly because Anderson throws us into a world we are a little familiar with and a lot more confused and curious with.Paul Thomas Anderson has said that after the critical success his breakout `Boogie Nights' was, he wanted to just cut loose and make a three-hour epic about whatever he wanted to make a three-hour epic about, develop unrelated characters who unexpectedly relate, and throw a bunch of Aimee Mann songs in it, just because the studio now gave him the power to do so. Somehow, that blunt description evolved into the towering, psychological, profound, brutally bold work of art and reflection of life that is called `Magnolia.'</fullReview>

Many people said the story was too confusing and was too long. I, however, was entranced by P.T. Anderson's storytelling and camerawork for all three hours and I could have watched for three hours more. The acting was superb, the cinematography better(can anyone say that the way Anderson moves the camera isn't amazing) and the music just was a cherry on top for me. I can't remember the last film that so perfectly used sound in conjunction with sight(the last scene kills me whenever I think about it). 1999 was a superb year for movies, but Magnolia deserves to take the cake for being simply amazing. This is the type of movie that makes me want to give up my promising career plans and pick up a camera.</fullReview>

It was out over here at a time when all there was to go and see at the cinema was the same old, predictable and not very good action movies(not that I am not a fan, but quality not quantity) and it was just a ray of sunlight which illuminated from the screen and I was captivated. I hung on every word that the characters were saying and what really got my attention was the rythm of the film and it's tempo from scene to scene. I have never seen that technique performed to such perfection as Paul Thomas Anderson did. It flowed hand in hand with the music and words of Aimee Mann, it was simply wonderful. The performance of each actor was just incredible. EVERYONE of them were a revellation. Tom Cruise was robbed of his oscar.I look forward to any news of P.T.

		<fullReview>Are there truly words to describe this film? It involves an entire list of main characters. One would think that these characters, in their complexity and their faults would only confuse the viewer. And this is the exact opposite.Be assured that Paul Thomas Anderson, no matter how crazy or eclectic the movie seems to drift toward, is always in control. He has an amazing ability to pace, to keep the movie moving while still holding that beautiful tension, such as moments before the game show begins, or the sadness of Julianne Moore holding onto her dying husband near his final moments.In short, its one long day in the San Fernando Valley. Around the intersection of Magnolia Ave, strange things happen. People live. People die. And the frogs...well, the frogs, those you have to see for yourself.Involving a Game Show Host (Phillip Baker Hall), his strung-out daughter (Melinda Dillon), a clumsy cop (John C. Reilly), and a teacher of seduce methods (Tom Cruise), who just so happens to be the son of a dying man (Jason Robards). Along with the dying man's crazy wife (Julianne Moore), the 1960's Quiz Kid (William H. Macy) whose life hasn't turned out the way he wanted it, and the new Quiz Kid (Jeremy Blackman) who doesn't want to be the smart one anymore. These are the stars of this film. Watch their world get torn down, built up, and torn down again.Some movies, you say, "that would never happen" or, "that could never happen". But two things the movie wants you to understand: It did happen. And, as the book says, 'we may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us'. These two points will haunt everyone in the film, and they will learn from what they forgot or want to forget before its over.Some people don't like this film. I've seen it twice, and on both occasions people have walked out. There is a lot of language. There is a lot of drama, there is a lot of artistry. This is NOT Mission Impossible. This is NOT Hollywood fluff. This film goes places that others wouldn't dare. The denouement (the ending where everything wraps up) is more beautiful, not just the frogs, not just the madness, but the way that Aimee Mann's soundtrack goes along with everything. It will explain everything on levels that you can't fathom. And when you leave the theatre, you will realize what magic you just witnessed. Paul Thomas Anderson has done it. Again.</fullReview>

I really did savor most of the film, although it started dragging heavily in the third hour. Magnolia is a slice of everyday life, with a small miracle or two, thrown in. There is a scene right near the end of the movie that you will either love or hate, but will never forget. I haven't been so startled, both literally and figuratively, by a "movie moment" in years. This "almost" climax makes up for the boredom that begins nipping at your toes in hour number three.

Tom Cruise' disintegration at the bedside of his dying father shows an actor of greater depth than he is usually willing to demonstrate, and Julianne Moore - as luminescent as ever: All grief, all guilt.

		<shortDescription>When it's all said and done, Magnolia is more emotionally and cinematically explosive than any other movie in history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia.Magnolia.Magnolia.For me, Paul Anderson has done quite a job at making this simple four-syllable word resonate in my ears, calling me to attention and slowly letting the indescribable mixture of emotions I feel every time I am exposed to this movie flood back in to my heart.It's better than Short Cuts. It's better than Nashville. It's better than The Godfather. For whatever reason, the unique balances thrown into the making of this wonderful, exquisite, inescapable picture are better than any other movie ever assembled. That doesn't come from a place of melodrama, it comes from a place of gratitude. How else am I to accurately describe the *gratitude* I feel towards Mr. Anderson and this film in general? I sure haven't seen another that has left me in a near fetal position at the end, literally floored by the glowing synchronicity (music, editing, acting, directing, plot arcs, everything just BURSTS at the end and is left lying on the asphalt like dead frogs to the tune of "Save Me") of it all. The movie isn't just good, or great, or really, really great, it's perfect. It shines like polished gold in my mind, and whenever I run across clips of it on T.V. or on the internet, I feel the same overwhelming sense of gratitude towards the maker.The critics of Magnolia claim that it's too long, or that it's too melodramatic, or it's too unrealistic, or that there is no point. They didn't want to see Tom Cruise talking about how to destroy women, they wanted to hear him talk about how to love women. The idea of a ten minute prologue that has no "names" infuriated the movie brats. To me, I feel that these people, these movie brats, have absolutely no idea what it means to sit in a theatre and watch a good movie. Those who wish to escape for ninety minutes walked out because, frankly, it's not every weekend that The Greatest Movie Ever Made comes out, and they just weren't ready to cope with the fact that they had to PAY ATTENTION for more than their alloted hour and a half. In short, there IS NO excuse to not like Magnolia, save for lack of attention span or willingness to understand that it is a work of fiction. It *is* relevant, it *is* true, it *is* real. It's not some little ditty that's going to be washed away from it's stature the next time an ensemble movie comes out.No matter WHAT ANYONE SAYS, nothing (not critics, not time, not anything) will eeeever be able to change the fact that when it's all said and done, Magnolia is more emotionally and cinematically explosive than any other movie in history.****************</fullReview>

Strikingly original, this movie refuses to let go of your attention from the very first scene.I, for one, was a bit reluctant to go to a movie that was well over three hours long and had nine main characters. But this movie makes excellent use of editing, the focus on the characters is switched around with such rapidity that you never grow tired of anybody or prefer one to another. Upon leaving the cinema I had the same feeling as I had when I had just seen American Beauty, except far more intense. I distinctely remember smiling to myself in the middle of one of the scenes after about an hour, just happy that there was more of this masterpiece left and that someone had actually made a movie this good.If you enjoyed Boogie Nights at all you must rush to see this. Every scene that did not quite work in Boogie Nights is performed brilliantly in Magnolia.Director Paul Thomas Anderson(or P.T. as he likes to call himself now) represents the future for movie-making. Not since Spielberg has a director made such an impact on Hollywood so young.Also, the cast performs miracles in front of your very eyes. Tom Cruise gives a career-best performance as the tutor of a sexual self-help programme called "Seduce &amp; Destroy". Julianne Moore is terrific, William H Macy is, as always, superb.Take my word for it, go see this movie. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great acting, great script, great music, great photography and great editing. It's also incredibly moving. One of the few modern films that accepts that people can be genuinely unselfish, and that what we do to each other on a daily basis actually matters.It's a shame that people decided to go and see "American Beauty", which in my opinion was a very hollow movie made by film-makers who had no experience of the real people they were supposed to be basing their characters on.Treat yourself, if you haven't done so already, and see it in a cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is honestly the best film of the year. First, Paul Thomas Anderson weaves in several seperate storylines, enough to me movies alone, altogether into one incredibly directed film. Secondly, the actors all give the best performances of their careers, including Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy all playing very complex, deep, and realalistic characters. Magnolia is a ten, and everybody deserves to see this film. It will go down in the history books as a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'... but it did happen!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** out of ****SPOILER ALERT: THIS IS JUST FOR WHO HAS SEEN "MAGNOLIA"I've already seen "Magnolia" twice and this is my second review, but I can't stop thinking about it. (God! It had only happened to me after watching "2001"!) "Magnolia" is a complete masterpiece, a work of genius, which we need to see several times to catch everything. Every single detail has its importance and significance. Or not... Life indeed can't be explained... Things happen..."Magnolia" is a film about the past contrasting with the present. Many characters say this: 'We are through with the past, but the past is not through with us.' It's a film about how our mistakes of the past reflect through our lives, and if we should be forgiven for those. The figure of a family is always there, specially the relationship between fathers and sons/daughters. That's where coincidences appear. Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is a very well known TV presenter of a show where intellectual kids take part. He committed a mistake in the past, which may be the reason of the repulsion his daughter Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), who is now a cocaine addicted, feels for him, even knowing that he is dying of cancer. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), producer of Gator's show, is on a more advanced level of the disease. He reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he has a son, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise), who is now a very famous misogynist. He also hates his father, because he left his mother when she was dying of cancer. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) was a famous kid at Gator's show in the '60s, but his parents took his money from him. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is now the star of 'What Do Kids Know?', but his father is only interested on the money he is about to win. Both Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) and Claudia do their actions by the effect of drugs. Both Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Phil are kinds of helpers. Claudia, Donnie, Frank and now Stanley suffer from childhood traumas. Donnie, with the bartender, Linda, with Earl, and Kurring, with Claudia, suffer because of love. Claudia, Frank and now Gator's wife Rose (Melinda Dillon) can't forgive other people for their mistakes. Wow! And there are more coincidences by the way. But this is not important. What matters is what the film has to say, and PT Anderson does this job very well. In a year of so many complex films ("American Beauty", "Eyes Wide Shut"), "Magnolia" may be the most complex and almost the most original (just behind "Being John Malkovich"). Complex because it talks about so many main subjects, and it does this perfectly well. As I said, everything has its importance. And original because it just doesn't have any cliché. Of course originality does not always mean quality (see "The Blair Witch Project"), but here it really works. Its similarities with "Short Cuts" and other Robert Altman's pictures are very small. The film editing is brilliant, the situations are beautiful and bitter and there are things we aren't used to see. The prologue is a joy, talking about amazing coincidences that can't be just coincidences, and prepares us for something unexpected. Near the end, all the main characters suddenly start to sing 'Wise Up', desperate as they are. Great! And... there is the conclusion. The rain of frogs. Yes, it has a sense. It is taken from Exodus 8:2- it's one of the plagues thrown by God at Egypt. Why don't throw a Bible plague at San Fernando Valley? We had already been prepared for this since the prologue and by characters' quotes and things written on bills, outdoors.PT Anderson, working with an amazing cast (I've already talked about that on my first comment), does a PERFECT job here. He even pays homage to Stanley Kubrick (my favorite director), with 'Thus Spoke Zaratrusta' (from "2001"). And, as the master, he leaves us with some questions. For example, what does the black boy mean? Who is he? A kind of God's hand? And there's the end. In "2001", Kubrick gave us wonderful, unspoken 20 minutes of impressive images. In "Magnolia", Anderson gives us a sudden end. Nothing of 'they lived happily ever after', but shows us that people need a second chance. The last scene takes place in the morning after the rain of frogs. It shows Kurring forgiving Claudia, saying that she is a good, beautiful person, who needs to love and to be loved. She smiles, looking at the camera. It is just... a wonder!I had to think to say this, because I was considering "American Beauty" as my favorite movie the week I saw it, but then I woke up. Well, I'm still dreaming of "Magnolia", so that I can say it's the BEST FILM OF 1999!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Of The Decade, One Of The Best Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is an indescribable net of emotions, feelings and age-gained wisdom. It's like Paul Thomas Anderson is older than he really he is. I mean, how can a 20 something year-old have so much knowledge of life and its meaning. This movie is like a will, something to leave behind and be remembered for. Life, death, old, young, sickness, health, confident smiles, guilt looks, so many things enrichen this movie. Beautifully written and directed, superbly acted by every single member of the cast, with a wonderful cinematography and original score, this is the real AMERICAN BEAUTY and actually it deserved all the oscars it was nominated for and those which it wasn't even. To end this commentary, I have to say one thing: Aimee Mann is a musical goddess and her songs contain all of the movie's heart and soul. No wonder P.T. Anderson says the script was adapted from her songs. I recommend also seeing Boogie Nights, almost as perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Magnolia"... is magnificent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** out of ****WARNING: SPOILER ALERT- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AMAZING FILM YET, PLEASE DO NOT READ MY COMMENTEvery year comes a load of terrible movies ("The Mummy", "The Blair Witch Project"), some bad ones ("Jawbreaker", "American Pie"), some simple movies ("10 Things I Hate About You", "Forces of Nature"). Some are good, but won't change your life ("The Messenger", "October Sky"), some are very good ("Man on the Moon", "Girl, Interrupted"), some are excellent ("Election", "Eyes Wide Shut"). But every now and then comes a movie that defy your intelligence and turn into something totally unforgettable. "Psycho", "2001: A Space Odyssey", "A Clockwork Orange", "The Godfather", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Schindler's List", "American Beauty"... "Magnolia"! It's strange to put a just-released film between so many classics (yes! "American Beauty" is an instant classic). But, thinking a little, that's where "Magnolia" belongs to. So what makes it so wonderful, so vibrating, so peculiar? That's what I'll try to answer.Do you believe in coincidences or do you think things happen for a reason? The original, darkly humorous prologue gives an interesting hypothesis about that, telling three different cases of death in which amazing coincidences happen. The three men hanged, the scuba diver, the suicide turned into a homicide. You start to see that this won't be an ordinary picture. After that, while Aimee Mann's song 'One' plays in the background, we are taken to a street called Magnolia, in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. There is a TV turned on and we can see a commercial where a chauvinist guy is advertising a help phone number for desperate men. A TV is also turned on in a bar, where an addicted girl meets a guy, and they soon go to her house to have sex. There is a mini documentary on TV about the life of Jimmy Gator, the presenter of a very famous TV show. Donnie Smith took part of this show when he was a kid, on the '60s, but nowadays he doesn't seem to have good luck. A smart kid and his rigid father are late to leave home. A good looking woman is tired of her much older husband's disease, or of something else. His nurse is a much more helpful man. And there is a police officer, who also seems to be tired, but of his job. It is a fast-paced mosaic, as fast paced as a MTV video. We think they are all ordinary people... and they are. What make these characters so special is that they are very well developed, as we rarely see in American movie. But what will happen in the next 24 hours? The weather schedule predicts rain.The police officer is Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), who is sent to a woman's house, where he finds out that she has killed the man who lived with her. The addicted girl is Claudia Wilson (Melora Walters), daughter of Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall). When he visits her in the morning she just throws rocks at him, even after he reveals that he has cancer. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is also dying of cancer, on his bed. He reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he has a son who doesn't speak with him. His name is Jack. No, Frank Mackey... Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise) is giving another of his lectures to men, throwing all his rocks at women. His aim is 'Seduce and Destroy'. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) is being fired of the store he works at, but he needs money to put braces on his teeth. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is an amazingly intelligent, peculiar child, who takes part at Jimmy Gator's show. The rain begins and he started to be prepared to win. Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is not taking control of her feelings. She married Earl for money, but now she finds out that she loves him. She is totally desperate. She wants to change his will, or to do something else. Kurring visits Claudia because of a neighbor complaint and an attraction appears between them. Frank gives an interview, and the reporter asks him about his past. Phil tries to contact Frank. Donnie suffers because of a homosexual love. Jimmy starts to suffer from his disease during the show. Stanley suffers from his father's pressure and can't even go to the bathroom. Earl is dying. Linda wants to kill herself. Everyone gets desperate. Many revelations are made, about mistakes of the past. Other coincidences happen. The night comes. At some moment, all the characters sing Aimee Mann's 'Wise Up' (another audaciosity of Paul Thomas Anderson, which goes perfect). But... Something happens. Something unexpected, surreal. Frogs... falling from the sky! An illusion? Or was it real? We don't know. Only the characters can see it. And the conclusion gives you a hope. A sweet hope.Director Paul Thomas Anderson could have stepped wrong many times, but he doesn't. His film is wonderful, perfect. It's an exotic box of surprises. It is about loving people, forgive the ones who hurt us, have love in our lives. The theme of love and hate is used during the whole 3 hours. And what wonderful 3 hours! The film is not slow; it is original and keep the audience close to the characters' personal dramas. Everything here is a gift. There are Aimee Mann's songs, which are part of the story. Without them, the movie wouldn't have been so perfect. 'Save Me' should have won the Oscar. (Well, I won't even discuss about the Oscar snub to this film) The acting is another gift. If I talked about the whole cast, my comment would be too big and the IMDb wouldn't accept it. But let me talk about two of them: Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. Cruise gives the best performance of his career. He is cynical, arrogant, perverse, but suddenly turns into a fragile person. And Moore surprises us once more. The pharmacy scene will remain in my mind for a long time, just because of her.PT Anderson can build a very different film from the excellent "Boogie Nights". Here he has Robert Altman as a base, specially "Short Cuts". But, believe it or not, his film is superior. He builds a mosaic of characters, but God is one of the main themes. Yes, the rain of frogs comes from the Bible, Exodus 8:2. It was audacious, but it just turned the film more intriguing. Just as a curiosity, the words Exodus 8:2 appear in some places during the film: an outdoor, written on a bill a person is holding at the show audience, etc."Magnolia" is not just amazing because of Exodus 8:2. It is a complete, complex picture. I had great expectations about it, and they were all filled. On my comment of "American Beauty", I said it was maybe the best picture I had ever seen. No, it's not. "2001" is still up there. But maybe "Magnolia" is even better than "American Beauty". Not the best film I've ever seen, but certainly one of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In relation to how it makes people react, this has to me one of the most divisive films I have seen in a long time. I really didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it. However, for the next week or so, on and off, I kept thinking about "Magnolia" and what it had to say about this life that we are all a part of.Sure, this film is, at times, excessive and alienating. However, if you are prepared to go where it takes you, you will discover a truly beautiful sense of humanity that weaves itself throughout the film. Example: the final sequence. Notice how in Claudia's apartment, the windows are always covered and how the world outside is never allowed to make it's presence felt due to the fact that Claudia can't deal with it? In the final sequence, you see a little bit of light start to shine through, illustrative of how Claudia's trying to start to make sense of her life. This sequence is, quite simply, breathtaking."Magnilia" features, without a doubt, some of the most powerhouse acting I've had the pleasure to have ever seen in cinema. It's hard to single out anyone in particular, but I would have to say that John C. Rielly just about stole the film. His character is akin to the movie's heart, and so captures one of the movie's main themes. Namely, that one can be leading their life and completely out of the blue, can encounter someone or something that can completely change the sense of direction in which they are heading.Personally, I've always been attracted to films that can challenge and provoke people and their conceptions about life; take them somewhere that they've never been before. I mean that in an emotional and intellectual sense; I got over the whole Spielbergian "cinema as thrill ride" mentality a very long time ago. Kubrick was a master at being able to challenge and provoke - look at reactions over the last thirty years to both "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange" . P.T. Anderson, along with David Fincher, are very much picking up where he left off.In short, "Magnolia" is one of the bravest and challenging films I've seen in the last ten years. I would unconditionally recommend this film to people who like to think for themselves and are able to have an open mind to make their own conclusions about something, rather than have everything spoon-fed to them.</fullReview>

It wasn't until I got home and started really thinking about what I just saw that I realized what an incredible film this was.If anybody tells you they "get it," they are lying. Interpretation is not about solving a crossword puzzle. Like Roland Barthes' book "S/Z" (which makes a guest appearance towards the end of the flick), appreciating this film is about taking little elements of it and putting them together in your mind to make something beautiful.Trust me, there are elements here that will never leave you. Put together a movie you loved, put together a movie you hated. The film allows you to see in it whatever you want. But I guarantee you, whatever you make of Magnolia, you will make an experience you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very uncommon that a film, or for that matter any work of art, truly 'touches' everyone. However, I would have to hold up P.T.A's 'Magnolia' as a shining exception to the rule -The film runs a very tight line from surreal to hyper-real which anybody who has ever 'lived' can at once relate to and enjoy.The ensemble-cast (Many of whom are P.T.A staple) perform on a level rarely seen (or allowed) in Hollywood fare. We all know these people - maybe they're us?! That's what makes this film so enchanting - it's like staring into a mirror that somehow accentuates the lines and scars we don't want to see. But on closer inspection reveals them as beautiful in their own right.If you told me you didn't enjoy 'Magnolia' I'd have to assume you were either dead or not human!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't enjoyed a film as much as I did with Magnolia since, hum, "2001". Carefully directed, with excellent photography and superior acting, "Magnolia" is set to become an icon of contemporary filmmaking.Unfortunately, You'll have to see it to understand what's all the fuzz about, and believe me, in this film, "Frogs fall from the sky"."Magnolia" takes place in the beautiful San Fernando Valley. It's amazing how distinct lives relate to each other. Nine stories are told, and are carefully, "Un"intentionally woven together. They all seek redemption (except for the Caretaker, who is somehow driven into this river of forgiveness), love and stability. It looks like they all have one day left to fix their entire lives, to heal ancient scars, to forgive and forget.Pay close attention to details while watching this movie. I couldn't believe my eyes for the first 10 minutes: We go to 1911, then to the 80s, and we go back to 1958... to end up in 1999. 10 minutes of film, with every single chronological detail carefully depicted.Enjoy the film. Forget logic. It's Opera. Let yourself go with this "Dantesque" travel... and, why not? Let magic reach your heart.</fullReview>

I thought that Aimee Mann's songs fit the scenes perfectly. I really sympathized with every single one of the characters.

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson had made two great films previous to this. "Hard Eight" was a very subtle and "Boogie Nights" which was exploding with characters and plots. All that I knew was that this film was directed by him and that was all I cared about."Magnolia" was hailed by many critics but panned by many movie go-ers. Anderson is a genius the level of Kubrick: this film won't be appreciated as a masterpiece for several years, much like Kubrick's films.The plot is tied together through Aimee Mann. Without her this movie would not have been made. She is the most talented female singer out there right now and truly deserved the Oscar for Best Original Song. Jon Brion's score is also very powerful.Everyone can find one or several characters to relate to. All of us have seen Cancer take members of our family, all of us know those people regarded as loser who are actually very nice individuals, and all of us have regrets. That's what this movie is about: "You may be done with the past but the past isn't done with you." It's emotions strike a chord with the heart as we relate with the characters.The cast of P. T. Anderson regulars, as usual, give strong performances. Tom Cruise is wonderful but Philip Baker Hall stole the show as game show host Jimmy Gator. He is one of those wonderful characters whom only a director willing to take a risk would place him in a large role. Anderson did in "Magnolia" and also cast him as the lead in "Hard Eight". William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, and Melora Walters are also in top form.The movie is over three hours but it was so powerful and fascinating and moving that another two hours would have been fine with me.A stunning masterpiece.</fullReview>

I found myself watching in boredom waiting for these characters to next appear and do a turn.A film you will probably remember, at least for some of the people in it, but not necessarily one you will enjoy sitting through.</fullReview>

I really dont want to spoil this movie for those who havent seen it. All I can say is that i guarantee that you will walk out thinking about the events of the movie. There are plots, subplots, and subplots among the subplots. There is a great deal of meaning and truth to this movie.

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is one of the great movies of our time; and, certainly the best movie of 1999. As opposed to "American Beauty", this film doesn't hinge on a single performance. Rather, everything in this film draws attention to itself. Like "Apocalypse Now" the script is very busy with varying levels of depth (coincidently, this film opens as impressively as well); and, well developed characters. The actors all give wonderful performances. Even the sound and art direction which are typically overlooked are noticed here. The true star, however, is Anderson who surely will someday join the ranks of Scorcese, Coppola and Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Acadamys loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet again the beloved Acadamy of Motion Pictures of Arts and Sciences have decided to more or less completely ignore the film. The film itself I did not want to end, it was so engrossing, moving and constructively told. The acting cannot be faulted on anyones part and Tom Cruise's nominantion is yes, well deserved, but the other members of the cast certainly are just as good. The "usual suspects" of William H Macy, Julianne Moore, and Philip Seymour Hoffman are as usual excellent. Luis Guzman is underused, but still has his usual "presence".Tom Cruise as I said is fantastic although if your girlfriend wants to see this film, her image of Mr Cruise maybe slightly altered. John C Reilly puts in a great performance, perhaps his best to date.Go and see this film. What happens to the characters would take me too long to explain. ***** / *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is, with little question, the best film of 1999. the simple, often painful plight of the human condition was not more beautifully illustrated in 1999 than in this picture. paul thomas anderson has done it again. my only suggestion is to listen with careful caution to whatever you may have heard (or did not hear because too few actually saw the film). see the film and judge for yourself. it was an incredible experience that stays with you long after viewing. try it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute astonishment comes over someone who was lucky enough to see PT Anderson's Magnolia, whether you got it or you didn't. The sheer talent that goes into not only writing something that many people won't even understand, let alone directing it to such perfection, is astounding. The acting is flawless, the amount of thought that went into the plot was crisp and fresh, and unlike its predecessor, Boogie Nights, a mature look at a movie that cries of perfection. It's numerous plotlines changes seamlessly, and makes you appreciate still going to the movies. Get out and see this film, view it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a big fan of Anderson ever since Boogie Nights and after seeing Magnolia I can honestly say that my expectations were in no way let down. The movie is powerful on so many levels and touches you in so many different ways. Each story, even though some are not even crucial to the plot, has it's own moral, characters and rhythm, but he skillfully combines all of them in a sequence of events that can only be described as genius. I've never been so utterly impressed at the quality of directing as I have with this film. The manner in which he crafted each story into a larger one while still maintaining it's individual characteristics and messages is nothing short of perfection. The movie has a sort of rhythm that is sped up and slowed down and paused and at the same time completely subtle. This is a cinematic masterpiece that I can't wait to get on video so I can analyze it further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a film truly ahead of it's time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all my twenty-four years, never before have I ever been so astounded at a film than I was the first time I saw this picture. Being a casual observer of film (as an English Major I prefer books) very rarely do I see a movie that moves me the way that this one did.For as outstanding as the acting throughout this entire movie is, the thing that truly sets this movie apart from most films is the frightingly realistic script set forth by Paul Thomas Anderson.Where most films bog down is the part in the movie where the director stops caring about the plot that he or she has spent developing for the first two-thirds of the film and begins to go off on some tangent where he or she tries to make some grand point about society or some other larger issue.But that in fact, is the whole point of this movie. Rather than showing a story with the typical "Hollywood" ending, Anderson decides that this movie will be more like real life. That is, he decided early that this movie will just be about the coincidences that seems to randomly permeate regular, everyday life.The tremendous acting performences that he then gets out of his actors is subsequently in response to a screenplay that puts his characters in a never-ending dizzing array of coincidental circumstances.Inter-woven into the fabric of this astounding sequence is an incredibly under-appreciated soundtrack. The whole effect boils down to the fact that the viewer has no choice but to walk away from this movie with a new-found appreciation for Mr. Anderson and his style of movie making that, while probably making some of the audience uneasy, proves that he is going to be one of Hollywood's next superstars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of the best movies of 1999 (along with American Beauty, Fight Club, Run Lola Run, and Being John Malkovich)and represents yet another technologically and narratively innovative film coming out of that year. The characters are as well developed and thought out as I would have hoped, if not more, and the ending DOES make sense. One of my favorite things about the movie is something I read in Entertainment Weekly, where P.T. Anderson said he wanted to construct the film like the Beatles' song "A Day In The Life". He related his film to it in the idea that the song slowly builds up to a climax, and then ends abruptly, and begins to slowly build itself again to another climax. The movie, like the song, is an amazing one, and the idea of constructing a movie the way that song was made is fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is way long. Yes, it's contrived. yes it lulls in places. Yes it's about a bunch of boring people and their boring problems.Welcome to life. I'll tell you why this movie is astonishing. Most movies build a sense of suspense and confusion somewhere about the second third of the movie and present their vacuous denoument therefater, leaving you pacified and happy that someone else did the thinking for you for the last 2 hours.This movie generates a looming sense of tension from the first 5 minutes and just keeps building until you get to the 'emotional' low point characteristic of this director's style. SPOILER - There's no happy ending, no sugar to help the medicine go down.So what's it all about. Well there are all these people, with seemingly disparate lives, histories, aspirations and problems. At the very core it's about adults and children and the way in which oppression always comes back to haunt the oppressors. Now, this isn't the first movie about messed up people and their messed up lives that's been made. Certainly won't be the last. I remember a little entry in last year's offerings called American Beauty which looked and felt much like this. Not being a resident of the US, I found American Beauty uninspiring and really just an inside (if dark) anecdote about suburban American life, that Americans would find amusing amongst themselves.Magnolia, I believe has pretensions of, and largely succeeds at presenting, a much more cosmic view of life, order, disorder and the universe.So what do you leave with for your $7? At the very least you leave with the knowledge that you have just seen the best performances and the most visually enthralling cinematography that $7 can buy. What else? What else then depends on what you came seeking in the first place.Be warned you will be required to think throughout and after this movie. You will be required to ask, 'what does it all mean?'. You are suppose to come away realizing that there's something larger at work in all our lives. Sounds like a bunch of hooey? Well maybe you're right, but try this. Remember that this a story about how adults treat children and vice versa. Some of us may hope to become adults some day, but we sure as heck have all been in that place called childhood at some time or another.If this is not not your bag, no problemo. I highly recommend you avoid this 3 hour exploratory of just a lot of non-sensical people and their non-sensical lives. If you ever like to take a good look in the mirror once in a while, check this stuff out, man. Truly astonishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unintelligent people who deem themselves intelligent are going to have a field day attacking "Magnolia." It is one of those brilliant masterpieces that will separate true lovers of cinema from people who go to the movies to kill a few hours. Anderson has taken what could have been a sloppy, unbearable mess, and skillfully sculpted it into a well-oiled machine. Never once during the 3 hours plus of this film did I even have the urge to glance at my watch. Anderson has truly become what people wanted Kubrick to be. I feel that people heralded Kubrick as a genius simple because his work was incomprehensible...lesser minds felt that he created genius, simply because they couldn't understand it. Anderson truly does create genius, and he makes it understandable for those who pay attention. Do yourself a favor, enjoy "Magnolia" in a theater, you'll thank Anderson for the poignant look into the hearts and minds of people who may be just like you, if only at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is the finest film that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. A film that works on so many levels. The film can make you laugh, cry, or even make you angry. Like 'American Beauty' it brings out all emotions that are trapped inside of you screaming to get out. Tom Cruise is priceless, and Oscar-worthy. He plays Frank TJ Mackey a public speaker who teaches seminars on how to "tame her" Her being your girlfriend. In one of the last great performances of the decade Cruise shines. He shines in one of the last great movies of the decade as well. The films ensemble cast could so easily fill the Supporting Actors/Actresses in the Oscars. Prizes which they so well deserve. William H. Macy, Jullianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reily, Jason Robards, Phillip Baker Hall, and Melora Walters all shine in a brilliant film, that should be seen by all. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson proves once again that he is one of the best directors of the 90s and will continue to shine in his years to come. Like Scorsesse, or Kubrick he doesn't want to please himself he wants to please the audience, he wants to take them on a ride that they will never forget. Yes, and pleasing himself in the process. Moments of comical, emotional, and frustrated genious. Many might think it's a bunch of psuedo-intellectualism. But some times something as weird as those frogs would make perfect sense in one of your darkest hours. This sets the standards for all other films coming in the next decade. BRILLIANT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times have you or someone you know complained about how their life sucked? The fact is, from time to time, everyone feels like they are going nowhere. We all regret things we've done.Now consider that something that seems horrible to one person may seem trivial to another. Hurting a toe by kicking the coffee table may be just as frightening to one person as crashing a car to another. Magnolia perfectly illustrates this point of view. It shows us that everyone has problems, and that all these problems are relative.The "job" that the beat cop was describing in the final speech was the "job" of life. Notice he did not directly allude to being a police officer.The minds behind Magnolia are trying to teach us a lesson of life. All you who hated the movie, i recommend you see it again. This time, instead of fussing about all the seemingly weird things going on, try to realize how they relate to your own life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There could be spoilers in here. I'm not going to censor myself.) How on Earth could all these bad reviews appear for this movie? And some one will answer that question by saying that it is long, pretentious, and boring. And that someone will be utterly wrong. (Okay, it's long, but it keeps your attention and that's the key.) Magnolia, how do I love thee. Let me count the ways:1) The directing. Sometimes Anderson delights with kinetic camera work (i.e. the diagrams explaining one of the opening vignettes or the long, sustained shot of the TV studio). Other times he just sets the camera down and concentrates on the actors. Every brilliant performance. A feast for the eyes.2) The characters. Lost souls desperately seeking some sort of redemption. The characters are portrayed with such compassion that I wanted to reach out and tell them everything will be all right. (Those who say that you wanted to kill the characters because they were annoying, you truly frighten me with your cynicism.) They keep the audience emotionally involved, full-steam. Never a dull moment. Perhaps a little overload.3) The story. The criss-cross of fate. The thematic similarities. "...the past ain't through with us." Those who don't understand the frogs (there, that's my spoiler), think about what God was supposed to be doing in the book of Exodus. This movie's all about redemption; the frogs (and the other plagues) were for the redemption of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.4) Aimee Mann. What a voice. What moving songs. The movie was written around them, and the songs reflect and magnify the power of the movie.5) I just have to single out my favorites from this cast. Mind you, there wasn't a bad performance turned in here: First, Jeremy Blackman. This kid was stunning. I don't know how someone that young can turn in such a layered, realistic job. A young boy, loved by all who don't know him, and unable to earn the love of his dad. I know people like that. Only Haley Joel Osment has turned in a better child performance in my lifetime. (I'm 19.) Second, Melora Walters. That babyface and girlish voice perfectly contrast with the brutal, drug-filled reality of her life. So full of fear and self-hatred. She deserves the Oscar. Philip Seymour Hoffman. Having recently seen this guy as a thoroughly unlikeable snob in The Talented Mr Ripley, I was amazed to see him as a likeable, clumsy, compassionate nurse in this one. I want to see more with this man. What else can he do? Tom Cruise's performance was a PARODY, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure most got that, but a few seem to take him seriously as this foul-mouthed sexist pig. Anybody who's seen Tony Robbins in action knows how close Cruise came to the real, genuine-article scam artist. I don't think he deserves the Oscar (which I would give to The Sixth Sense's Osment), but this is the best role I've seen him in. I don't think I have room for the rest of the cast. Let me just close by saying that this epic is entertaining, heartbreaking, insightful, funny, and fun. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

He gets a call to investigate a noisy disturbance at an apartment where he finds a desperate woman addicted to cocaine. It's love at first sight.John C. Reilly deserves some kind of award for his performance as the devout, sincere, beleaguered and lonely patrolman. His story alone would make "Magnolia" a great movie, but it's only a part of the mosaic. Jason Robards, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Henry Gibson (as barfly Thurston Howell) and other actors too numerous to list make this a movie a great team performance. There's no "big star" -- every character is important and painfully human. The movie is full of bittersweet humor, but much more life-affirming than "Boogie Nights."I just wonder, though, were any frogs harmed in making this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, those that want the three hours of their life back because they didn't like the film, well, i've only got one thing to say about that, "GO WATCH WATERBOY" you may be able to follow the plot a little better, and plus it has lots of slap stick and shinny things.It's kind of funny, those that hate the movie give long and drawn out interpretations of the film. It seems that PT has done his job, made you think about the film. And for the guy that said he hated it and had to go the second time to make sure. Well, i hated "Deuce Bigalow" but you don't see me going to the theater to "make sure." The fact is, you liked it. You may not know it now, but later you will. This film was not a waste of time, but merely an addition of time. I felt like 3 hours and 10 minutes were given to me after I saw this film. What else would I have been doing, sitting at home watching All in the Family reruns??A good film gives a lasting impression. To tell you the truth, I can't remember the plot of "Any given sunday" and I just saw it a week ago. But if you ask me to tell you the name of the kid trying to kill himself at the beggining of Magnolia, I could tell you. This movie has such a strong lasting impression that you will find things out about it two weeks after you saw it.PT Anderson, like all indie film makers, isn't trying to "sell tickets" like all these rock'm sock'm directors in mainstream hollywood. In fact, I don't think he could care less if he made 20 bucks at the box office. He sat down, and said "im gonna make a film the way I want it to be made." And that he did. What we got was 3 plus hours of pure emotion, fantastic camera action, and many outstanding acting performances. What else can you ask for from a film? Well, maybe Nick Nolte or some John Tesh music."Oh, they use the f-word too much." Thus thee "R" rating. This ain't no disney movie. To be quite honest with you, I didn't even notice the swearing until people started crying about it. And according to some previous comments, swearing is acceptable if and only if it's funny. The biggest thing I learned in my film interpretations class is that a director has TOTAL creative control of a film. Everything in it is a direct result of the director. Pure and simple. And I don't think PT threw in swear words just for the heck of it. It has purpose. Just look for it, and you will find it.No, every film doesn't have to have a climax. Well, atleast not one with explosions and building implosions. I mean come on. Don't expect every film to follow the basic principals of movie making (intro-&gt;rising action-&gt;climax-&gt;falling action-&gt;resolution). Those days are done. PT knows this, Joel and Ethan Coen know this, and so does every GREAT film maker. Along with Fargo, this may be the biggest film of the decade. We should bless such originality instead of condemning it. I mean, I don't think I could take another court room thriller from the likes of Grisham. (oh my god, their pouring things into the lake, lets take em to court...enter action) So I leave you with a quote from PT himself concerning Magnolia, "you get from a film what you take into it." And if you go into the film expecting non stop action, you will be disappointed (even though I found the entire film entertaining and action packed (but not the action your thinking of)) If you go into this film with an open mind, a creative mind, and an educated mind, you will be enlightened and intrigued.This is a gem of a movie that deserves all the recognition it gets, both good or bad. Remember, this kind of creativity doesn't come along everyday. And the way it looks for PT it won't come along again until he releases his next film.Just see it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often, in the general way of the world, lives overlap. When this occurs, and the participants are unaware of the meta-confluence, a state of grace is achieved. This is the foundation of all great narratives, the architecture of the so-called collective consciousness. Let's call it culture.One of the great levelers in any society is an awareness of suffering. This is often considered to be an Eastern perspective, but look me in the eye and tell me that every belief system is not in some way motivated by the knowledge of suffering -- whether it operates as an aversion or an affinity. Let's call it a coping mechanism (term encompasses religion/philosophy).People often do terrible things when they're suffering. Any number of calamities, abuses, crimes, conniptions, and conflagrations comes to mind. But less often, a mind, in its suffering, creates an object for that suffering, and transmutes the agency of the pain. Let's call it art.For me, Magnolia is a film about people who are hurting. They've intermittently hurt other people, and they've just as frequently hurt themselves. There's a baseline for the sadness these characters share, and when the singing sequence kicks in, it represents -- to me -- the one golden moment when, unbeknownst to them, they are not alone. With a simple common pop-cultural reference, their despair is elevated/objectified into art. It's harmonious -- literally and figuratively. For once, none of them is participating in the pain of anyone else. They're just singing, quietly, expressing a universal lament.It's the fulcrum of the film. Afterwards, some characters end up being healed, others saved, and some destroyed, but the point is that something meaningful and transcendent has transpired. And that's the most we can hope for in an agnostic universe that continually confuses and confounds us with its pyrotechnic virtuosity and its mind-bending distortions.</fullReview>

Then the 82% chance of rain (Exodus 8:2 stating that you shall have a plague of frogs put upon you if you don't release the jews or isrealits, i can't quit remember, so the 82% chance of rain and the frogs being the rain, I think that was his attempt at bible humor). The Exodus 8:2 on the bus stops. The Exodus 8:2 in the crowd of the TV show. He wants a 2 but gets an 8. When macy is puking in the toilet, he's reciting a verse from Exodus. The plane that kills the scuba diver has an 82 painted on the side of it. 8 times 2 is 16, and sixteen is divisable by 8 and 2, WEIRD!!! The boy from the projects refers to himself as the prophet.oh, and jimmy gator does not kill himself, the frog from the window saves his life. William H. Macy's character didn't need braces, but after the frog hit him in the face, he needed them.I found this movie to be very entertaining, any movie that requires two viewings to pick up everything is just amazingly good. I wasn't too big of a fan of Boogie Nights, but this film made me an instant fan of PT Anderson.Congrats to Anderson on such an intriquing film, and I await your next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I thought that Magnolia was one of the best movies that I saw all year. Most movies you see are mass produced pieces of trash and I was glad to see a major motion picture that was not. I thought that some of the references in the movie added to the intrigue that felt. I really enjoyed the beginning and the ending was quite interesting. I plan to go and see more P.T. Anderson films because of this movie. I think that most of the people that I have heard saying that it was not a very good movie, did not really understand it. Sometimes movies have deeper meanings than guns and breasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Magnolia, was absolutely amazing. By far one of the most entertaining and mind warping films in recent years. I advise anyone who loves movies to see this movie! It is definitely worth it. The development of characters is rich and deep. The entire cast could receive actors for giving such heart-warming and enjoyable performances. The true praise must go to Paul Thomas Anderson who wrote and directed this sensationally bizarre trip. It also has one of the greatest climax/plot twists in movie history... please see it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is my personal favorite for 1999. I had very high expectations which were surpassed. Watching it, I kept wondering how much energy went into construction each sequence and then linking them with a skill I've not experienced in my lifetime. This guy knows how to make movies. In truth, it could be about eating Cheetos and I would still have been impressed. What we get, however, is a warning of the consequences of spiritual impoverishment. With unchecked inventiveness and aiming right at the audience, Mr. Anderson nails fin de siecle America right to the wall. Game show greed, substance and sexual abuse, broken families and marriages, battered children, urban violence.... the list is from the headlines of our culture.But the film consoles us that it as new Age of Prophets, and the children begin to speak and warn of the consequences of our craziness.I won't argue with people that the film's turning point comes out of left field. If you object to that, then I'd suggest your expectations from life are too logical. And that's a narrow road that this film warns us leads to a very dead end.I look forward to Paul Thomas Anderson's next film. The fact that his work remains in the forefront of some very serious acting is proof that he's a rare artist. Holding his own with Jason Robards' and Tom Cruise's work here makes me think he's without peer among today's directors.I'm not a fan of Aimee Mann's contributions here, although her songs do move the story forward they don't stand alone on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is an incredible array of humanity and human experience, a veritable banquet of sin and forgiveness, of coincidence and synchronicity, of broken dreams and cherished sorrows. It is a gripping masterpiece of a film, with astonishing performances (Tom Cruise AIN'T "Jerry McGuire" in THIS movie!), editing that moves the stories along with breathtaking fluidity, and a remarkable soundtrack that is a character in itself. All the characters have distinct and compellingly grim sagas to witness or to tell--for me, the clearest voice and the narrative thread of the piece comes from John C. Reilly's exquisite performance as the lonely, emotionally fragile cop, Jim Kurring. And it is the awesome spectacle towards the end of the film, which no doubt will leave many scratching their heads, that underlines the movie's REAL agenda and message. No spoilers here--simply see this monumental testimony to The Human Community. Kudos to the brilliant Paul Thomas Anderson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And The Book Says . . ."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "greatest" used to mean something. Slowly however, its importance and effect on people began to deteriorate, with more and more people finding that it got people's attention the way "best" never would. The ultimate blow to its relevance, of course, was Y2K. It was as if everyone felt that they needed to wrap the past thousand years up with an opinion of their own and so, everybody made their respective lists, declaring the "greatest" this and the "greatest" that, never thinking about the consequences of their actions. And because of this reckless abandon, a perfectly good word paid the price of overexposure.In this new millennium, there have been quite a few good things. But nothing that can measure up to director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest effort, "Magnolia". I dare anyone to show me something with as much vigor and life in it as Mr. Anderson's sweeping tale of nine people in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the mistakes they've made, and the measures it will take for them to wise up.Much like the details of this film, the reasons people like "Magnolia" have been vague from the very beginning. There's so much to absorb, so much for one to take in, that it's easier to simply call it a masterpiece than it is to explain why it's a masterpiece. I think the reason people are floored by this film is because of its crescendo. The subtle crescendo that begins to build so effortlessly with an opening monologue dealing with coincidence, and does not reach its end until after a particularly epic sequence that shall go unrevealed to those who don't like having surprises ruined for them.It's a crescendo that is carried out by a very precise balance. Aimee Mann's harmonious songs bring the film a unifying voice much the way Simon and Garfunkel did on "The Graduate". Jon Brion's pacing score lets the plot blossom effectively, adding just the right amount of urgency to the flowing plot as is necessary. Dylan Tichenor's succinct editing cuts us off from each character's unfolding tragedy just when he ought to, even if we don't want him to. And of course, the wonderful performances from the cast,(including Melora Walters and John C. Reilly as perhaps the most anomalous couple in movie history) gives everyone the dramatic foundation on which to lay their creative bricks.All of these factors are woven in together by P.T. Anderson to tell an absolutely paramount story of what happens when parents aren't nice to their children. And so, when looking back on the experience of "Magnolia", I can genuinely say without the slightest bit of disregard that it is not only the best film of the year, but indeed the greatest film I have ever seen.". . . We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most personal, emotionally involving movie of '99</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I go to movies to EXPERIENCE movies, and 99 had been a really good year for me. However, everything in the year that i've seen (and i've seen heavy weight ones, such as the end of the affair and american beauty)paled in comparison to the experience i had with magnolia, both during and after the movie. It is the kind of movie that is personal; you have to relate to the characters and their dilemmas to love the movie with a passion. Otherwise, it's a waste of time, or so i've heard (though i came out of the theatre puzzling how anyone could HATE this movie). With a movie this grand, it is hard to avoid itsy bitsy holes (EVERY movie has flaws if viewed at certain angles) that are stretched unnecessarily large by those who either may not understand the movie EMOTIONALLY and think they're way too smart to succumb to the most ambitious movie of '99, or simply don't care due to personal irrelevance. I think anyone who's into classic psychology, or is interested in the human's mind and its conflicts would really appreciate the movie. The movie brings in many elements of psychical conflicts, ie. denial (the game show host), conflicts between parents and child (Tom's part is brilliantly sketched, and realistic too). There are many layers and a lot of them is surprisingly subtle considering the scale of the movie (ie. Why is Tom a sex guru whose motto is to seduce and destroy woman? there are many takes on that, one of which is he takes on his father's role as a vicious womanizer, may be to justify his father's act, may be to try to pretend that he was connected to his father in his actions so he could tell himself that he was not really abandoned by his father). Then there are also regrets, and guilt, and that forgiveness will not always be granted in life, etc. The most emotionally involving movie of '99. Kudos to Anderson for daring to make magnolia big and bold without lacking substance. p.s. the frogs have biblical reference, and in case anyone who's not aware of it, frog rain actually happened. As one knows, strong storms could pick up a lot of relatively heavy objects and dispose them elsewhere. If anyone would like to find out more about this, you can contact me. p.p.s. for X-files fans, frog rain should be no big deal. Chris Carter had already used it in one of his episodes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing work from a promising young director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In only his second film, PT Anderson has given us a classic film that challenges the longtime practices and established ideals in Hollywood. Working outside of the classic narrative structure and without being tied to three acts and a climax, Anderson has managed to build a story within a single day, involving no less than six major characters who are each fully developed and give us some insight into the preciousness of the human condition. Aside from the blatant point of the film as being an exercise in unpredictability, there is a familial construction that takes place, much as he utilized in Boogie Nights, that ties each character together despite any actual contact they may have. The climax is beyond explanation and a revelation of bizarre. Tom Cruise gives the performance of his career as Frank "TJ" Mackey, splaying his misogynistic hatred and charisma onto the screen before us in an award winning role. The film is long, but necessarily so and the moments of self reflexive humor are priceless. This film was made by a lover of movies for those who love to see them and is as much about the seeing of movies as it is about the weather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaw dropping! Stunning! A brilliant masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights) has managed to make one of the most compelling and engrossing films in motion picture history.Things fall down. People look up. And when it rains, it pours. This is certainly at the heart of Anderson's drama.When talking about "Magnolia" I think everyone that enjoyed it has a loss for words. Anderson takes several people in the San Fernando Valley, in California, and brings their incredible stories together over a short period of time. It's hard to describe "Magnolia" but very easy to praise, especially for its acting, directing, writing, cinematography, and originality. However a lot of viewers didn't care for the film because of its questionable ending and some scenes that were really different, innovative and brilliant if you ask me, like the scene where every character is singing the same Aimee Mann song and, of course, the frogs.Tom Cruise gives the best performance by a supporting actor this year as Frank T.J. Mackey, a guru in male self-esteem when it comes to seducing and destroying. His simple methods that can make any man casanova, like himself. While I would love to comment on every performance it is just easier to say that Ricky Jay, Jeremy Blackman, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Melora Walters, Melinda Dillion, and Alfred Molina combine to give the best ensemble performance of '99."Magnolia" is also provided with a great sound track by Aimee Mann that practically has a starring role. Heard loud and clear throughout the film the songs are perfectly placed and well delivered adding to the overall impact of the film.Thank you very much Mr. Anderson for making a film that jumps off the screen and says "Hey you in the third row...yes you eating the over buttered popcorn. If you want to see some eye and no-brain candy the new action flick is just down the hall on your left. But if you want eye and brain candy stay here, shut up and be prepared to be blown away by this film that is going to push your thoughts and imagination to the limits."It's under the opinion of the films narrator that "these things just happen". And it's under opinion of this critic that some films are just amazing, mesmerizing, and truly inspirational, especially to future film makers. "Magnolia" is really what great films are all about.One of the best of the decade!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>third time's the charm for pt anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson was able to improve on his two previous (and very good movies). He cut out the dead time which hurt Hard Eight to a degree and added more depth and a wider range of characters than in Boogie Nights. The fact he was able to keep up a constant pace for three hours is a testament to both his writing and directing abilities.There are some people who will not enjoy this film - too long, they will say, or not enough going on. I believe the opposite to be true. To be honest, I'm amazed everything was put on film in only three hours. Each character shows such incredible strength and weakness during this movie it feels half its playing time.As great of a job as PT Anderson did, the performances are the highlight of the movie. From Tom Cruise to Phillip Baker Hall (who isn't in enough films at all) to Julianne Moore, everyone is incredible. John C. Reilly does stand out - his character is perfectly defined in his first scene in the film.The reason why the movie works is because it is able to succeed where other character-driven movies fail. Other movies fall short because you've seen the same people doing the same things before. PT Anderson gets your buy-in because of the unconventional methods he uses. Magnolia's intro is from out of nowhere, but has everything to do with the picture. I'm not sure if anyone else could have gotten away with a biblical plague as catharsis, but it works here.If you want an empty hour-and-a-half, I think Supernova is still playing in the theatres. But if you're looking for a movie that will grab hold of you, one that will make you care about the characters, and one which will stick with you, see Magnolia.</fullReview>

The ones who hate it are A.) the ones who don't get it or B.)The ones who blame P.T. Anderson for being young.I loved it. I understood it. "It isn't dangerous to confuse children with angels." "Exodus 34:7." "Love is a rebellious bird." "Exodus 8:2". It makes perfect sense.Film folks claim that the symbolism is too blatant, Anderson is too greedy, and it's far too melodramatic. Well, obviously a whole bunch of people missed the blatant symbolism, because they b***h and moan about how nothing in the movie made sense. They say it was too long. I say if it was any shorter, it would get pretty confusing (which people also claim that it was...which I didn't see). Overacted?

I can't say that I've ever lost a loved one, but I came very close, and I had the same rage as everyone in Magnolia seemed to have. It wasn't overacted at all. (Shame on the Golden Globes, by the way, for nominating Tom Cruise instead of Jason Robards for supporting actor).If you think it was P.T. Andersons self-indulgent over-dramatic piece of 3 hour melodrama, I can't help you out much. We'll agree to disagree. If you complain because you didn't understand it, try to pay a little better attention next time.

But the most noteworthy musical element is Jon Brion's scoring which underlies large portions of the film. P.T.

		<fullReview>In any one of the few reviews that I have read, the reviewer has danced around what this movie is really about. Perhaps it's too difficult, perhaps it;s too frightening to fathom, perhaps finding meaning would require too much thought. But in my estimation, the more a movie requires thought, the better. Haven't you heard people say, "well now that I've thought about a bit more. . ."?Magnolia is very much a film for thought. P.T. Anderson's (dir) recurring idea of family and it's sometimes painful necessity is presented clearly in Magnolia, more so than in Boogie Nights with it's pseudo-familial structure. This is the crux of Anderson's first three features, but in Magnolia he takes the idea of story about a family and shatters it on the ground. As the pieces are picked up, the story becomes one of the interconnectedness of all of us. In a sense the he presents the greater structure of the human family. The son's, fathers, daughter's, wives--a race that feels alone and unconnected. By the end of this film, the lost souls inhabiting its world come together under the prompting of something beyond them, something that rained down frogs on all of them to get their attention, to get them to stop doing whatever, to get them to remember they were made by something bigger than all of their pettty, destructive, problems.Hence, Magnolia is one of the more profound attempts at cloaking the transcendent in a metaphor to further purport it's importance and beautiful meaning for all of our lives. Much like Eyes Wide Shut it's truth and meaning have largely been missed by critics to caught up in clever rhetoric and catering to the masses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't originally ever going to write one of these reader comments, but after looking at how so many people misunderstood parts of the movie i cannot help but write and clarify some things. Alright correction---there are some of you who say the explicit language is uncalled for--I would like you to pull your head out of the typical "Stepmom" hollywood writing crap, that to be frank with you...IS NOT HOW PEOPLE TALK. Get out and actually listen to people...especially when they are p***ed off or scared or upset...BELIEVE ME THEY USE as you would call it EXPLICIT LANGUAGE. I would love for someone to express to me any other writer who can write REAL dialogue like Paul Thomas Anderson...they are rare and few...and if you want to hear the typical hollywood crap writing like in Titanic, where the writing is nothing close to being real then fine, but dont you dare ask why he used "EXPLICIT LANGUAGE".*SPOILER*Another clarification....a couple of you asked why was the officer talking to Julianne Moore at the end of the movie...hate to break it to you, but you MUST be going blind or doing something else throughout the entire movie, that is the "coke addict".*SPOILER*Another comment about the ending with the frogs. This movie is SO diverse in themes; parts of the movie are an ULTRA-REALISTIC look at regrets, apologies, forgiveness, the past, connections with people, however if you just look at the movie from that one angle you are missing the whole picture of the movie. There is another surreal "Spike Jonzeish" feel to some of it, that truly IS UNBELIEVABLE, yet that is indeed the purpose. You only bring up the "frog sequence", and you say that didn't fit in, there are unbelievable delicious parts throughout, example: the delightfully impossible gameshow, the whole beginning narative, among others.*SPOILER OVER* Do not think that PT Anderson put those parts in the movie to agree with many people's one theme minds. He meant to add unbelievability in it, how else can you truly explain the experience of life other than through the unbelievable.*FEW MINOR SPOILERS* Alright about the characters, some people dissed Julianne Moore's acting in the movie, some even went on to say she can't play more than one character. Alright, tell me what is it about her character that is in anyway unbelievable. She shows her deep regret, her deep confusion, her utter sadness for how shes screwed her life up with such crystal clear perfection, that I wonder honestly what was your problem with her acting...if it was her screaming and swearing...i bet youd be doing the same damn thing if you were in her position. The other comment about the acting I can not understand is the complete lack of compassion for the only true savior, as in literary terms called the "christ-like character", Officer Jim Curring. His sad loneliness and desire to make a difference is one of the sweetest and most compassionate portrayals I have witnessed.*SPOILER OVER*Overall, I am disappointed with the misunderstanding of Paul Thomas Anderson's new epic magnitude of film making. I mean fine if you dislike it, BUT DONT, I SAY DONT YOU DARE SAY SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO PROOF FOR, NOR CAN YOU NOT SAY (LIKE THE MOVIE OR NOT) THAT NO OTHER MOVIE HAS DONE(or as some of you say "attempted") SO MUCH AS THIS MOVIE HAS IN A TRULY LONG TIME...THE BEST MOVIE OF 1999 and one of the best of the decade!</fullReview>

Some overlap, some don't touch, some obscure other petals entirely until they are pulled away.The plots are too diverse, confused and complex to summarize, but on a rainy day in the San Fernando Valley, the lives of a dying man, his estranged son, his gold-digger wife and his caretaker intersect strangely with those of a legendary game show host, his long-suffering wife, his coke-snorting daughter, a bumbling cop, a brilliant little boy, his Svengali father, a murderer and a sad-sack former child star suffering from unrequited gay love.It seems unbelievable that so many characters could be part of a coherent film, but indeed, these characters weave in and out of each other's lives, forming the solid, connected tissue that is modern existence. The film's symbolism is rich and complex, fraught with biblical references, cultural anomalies, sharply witty observations about the banalities of modern life and the overriding sense that ultimately, we are all alone.Alone, but interconnected-- every person's actions affect those of every other person, and with just the right mix of the uncanny, the unexplained and the unattainable, the effects of these actions can be both cataclysmic and redeeming.MAGNOLIA is a brilliant film. Tightly written and directed, artistically filmed and superbly edited, it envelops the viewer in the collective chaos of these lives and at just the moment when all seems to be heading toward resolution, the mother of all dei ex machina rains down complete chaos and changes all their lives forever.Go see it. Go see it twice. The film is all-American but feels distinctly foreign. The first viewing seems long, but enjoyable, and you really have to see it more than once to get everything. Tom Cruise is stellar; Julianne Moore and Jason Robards also give award-calibre performances. Above all, however, hats off to director and writer P.T. Anderson for giving us this incredible film.MAGNOLIA is a big, wet, sloppy film that is altogether fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some fools have said this movie is too long, but they are complete and utter fools. My sister is among these people and its irritating to know that people don't have the decency to sit through Magnolia after they wasted their time sitting through films like Titanic. However this movie is not Titanic, it wastes no time with useless scenes; each scene has signifigance to the overall whole of the movie. ESPECIALLY the ending, whether you like it or not it is signifigant in bringing all the characters stories together. In my opinion this movie not only lives up to Boogie Nights, but surpasses it in many respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Magnolia" is a poem of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes work on the part of the viewer to analyze and discover the beauty of this movie. On the surface it's disjointed and bizarre. But underneath, there are half a dozen separate stories of amazingly real people. This is a movie that captivates not through explosions and violence but through the simple interactions of people. It's like a tapestry. Each life depicted is a thread with its own color and texture. There is a narrative for each character, proceeding in a natural order. But this order is confused and twisted as the movie jumps from one narrative to the next and back again at random. It's in the intertwining of the individual lives as the characters cross each other's paths that the real beauty of "Magnolia" is found. This is not a movie for everyone. You have to be willing to invest yourself into the viewing, to take the time to pay attention and really think about what you're seeing. If you're willing to do so, though, "Magnolia" is worth every second and dime spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands Down, The Best Film of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is one of many few films where I knew it was going to be a great film long before I saw it. Two years ago, "Boogie Nights", written and directed by the same man, Paul Thomas Anderson, was my choice for best film of the year. "Nights" has also become one of my all time favorites. I knew Anderson could once again bring a cinematic masterpiece to the screen, and he has with "Magnolia", which is my choice as the best film in a year when there have been so many of terrific films, like "American Beauty" and "The Matrix". Every year or two, we get our share of films that center around a group of characters who's lives intersect at one point or another, such as "Playing By Heart" and "Short Cuts". Anderson has crafted by far the best film of this type that you're likely to see. And what a cast this is. Never before has an ensemble cast shined to the point that you find it difficult to single out a 'great' performance. I can certainly say that Tom Cruise's performance as Frank T.J. Mackey was one that totally blew me away. We've seen Cruise shine on the screen in films like "Jerry Maguire" and especially "Born on the Fourth of July", but nothing will prepare you his jaw-dropping work in this film. And the rest of the cast, as I said, shines. From Phillip Baker Hall to Julianne Moore to William H. Macy to John Reilly to Phill Hoffman, etc. there isn't a single flawed performance. "Magnolia" is a wonderfully written tale of characters who are dying, bitter, in denial, looking for love or redemption, and wanting respect. All of these issues are perfectly realized through Anderson's writing and his vision. And in the end, people and events are brought together in a way that I promise you that will not predict by any means. This is a film that I will watch again and again, much like "Boogie Nights", because of it's one of a kind storytelling and landmark acting. Paul Thomas Anderson has now established himself as a filmmaking prodigy, as far as I'm concerned. If his name is tied to any film, no matter what kind, I will watch it in an instant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say the Magnolia, was simply a movie would be utterly ridiculous. Magnolia is a FILM of the highest caliber. Incredible direction, acting and writing have come together in a beautifully complete package unlike anything you've ever seen. Magnolia has heart, and lots of emotion. It is not for everyone though, some people, the young for example, may not enjoy it as much as the rest of us.An incredible story is built around numerous characters, all with there own unique characteristics and quirks. The acting is incredible and successfully pulls the viewer into the lives and emotions of the characters.The soundtrack will blow you away, at times it is like watching the greatest music video you have ever seen, and at other times the music pulls you in and almost makes your heart weep. This movie will leave you thinking, but it will also leave you feeling strangely fulfilled. Everyone should see this film, not everyone will like it, but most should. BEWARE it is very long (3 hours), so have lots of free time. See it more than once and you will enjoy it even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Magnolia": a combination of coincidence, tragedy and miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With any film that takes three hours to unfold its running time, the experience had better be worth it. With "Magnolia," director Paul Thomas Anderson creates a masterpiece so magnificent, so epic, so original that when I had finally stood up after spending my three hours in the movie theater, I regretted standing up and wished I was there for three hours more.Once again, as he did in "Boogie Nights," Anderson focuses his lens on the interrelationships between families in Southern California. What Anderson does here though is more special than in his previous film. He weaves coincidence with tragedy, joy with pain, the spectacular and miraculous with the simple and ordinary, and love with hate. Not to mention that the film is really about parents and children, husbands and wives. Anderson is most concerned with two things: overbearing parents and adulterers. These are the link between all of the plot lines in Anderson's story. The adulteries committed by the two patriarchs in the story, Jason Robards' Earl Partridge and Phillip Baker Hall's Jimmy Gator create the dysfunction in their families that Anderson explores. Most affected by this dysfunction are the characters played by Tom Cruise and Melora Walters. Walters' character becomes a coke addict and Cruise becomes a positively warped self-help guru.Anderson also gets very biblical at times, especially in the shocker ending, which is too much of a surprise to be mentioned. "Magnolia" also has its angels and devils. The angels here are John C. Reilly's cop and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's nurse, and in a way the fathers are devils. However, while the dying men played by Robards and Hall show remorse at their time of judgement, the one true demon Anderson shows us is the father of the young came show contestant, Stanley. Stanley's father uses his son's gifts for his own benefit. When the young Stanley asks his father to treat him better and love him more, the fathers response is both evil and heartbreaking.Most impressive about the film is the techniques used to tell the story. Anderson opens his film with a shot reminiscent of the movie "Slacker," where one character's intro leads into anothers. I don't think any director has ever used this technique so magnificently. Anderson also uses several impressive tracking shots and an incredible soundtrack by Aimee Mann and Jon Brion. At one point, the many characters engage in a sing-along to an Aimee Mann song, and the result is moving instead of corny.See "Magnolia". It is a film that incorporates every aspect of filmaking, storytelling and acting to leave a profound and provoking experience on its viewers.</fullReview>

This movie makes "American Beauty" look like a preschooler's picture of cardboard suburbia. This movie is so deep and intriguing, that it will be continually dissected for the next 30 years while most of this years movies will be forgotten. The opening to this movie probably left some people scratching their heads, but I thought it was positively brilliant. The conclusion also left some people scratching their heads, but it was brilliant as well. If you weren't paying attention and thinking about the movie, it would confuse you but I thought it was perfect. I thought the film ran about 20 to 30 minutes long, but it was so great I forgive it. All the characters are very tightly connected, if you didn't see how they were go back and watch it again. The acting is positively magnificent, every member of the cast is amazing People need to realize that this isn't a Tom Cruise movie, this is a P.T. Anderson movie. There is an astronomical difference. Don't go see this unless you want to go see a P.T. Anderson movie. This was by far the best movie of the year. A perfect 10/10. Miraculous.</fullReview>

Anderson has elevated himself to the top of my list with this work. There was so much to see, to hear, yet somehow I felt as if there could have been more. At 3+ hours, I still wanted it to go on.I went into this film with very high expectations, and it did not disappoint me at all. The acting was superb, too bad they don't give an Academy Award to an ensemble cast. This one deserves it. This movie restored my faith in American filmmaking.If you go to this movie, keep your eyes and ears open, or you'll miss out. I wont give away the plot, because the plot is something different for everyone. Some will see it as a twisted day in the lives of 9 people, some will see it as a study in surrealism (especially at the end - BUT IT DID HAPPEN). I saw it as a brilliantly acted and directed film, with a message. Again, that message will be different for each and every one of us.I feel bad for the people who see the movie (especially the end) and don't understand what it means to them. They will have missed out on an insight into their own hearts and minds. But I wont judge them, I'll leave that to the objects falling from the sky.

This is a mosaic of stories, each one worth telling on its own, all woven together by threads of circumstance -- coincidence? Fate? Jason Robards gives a marvelous performance, Tom Cruise finally gets to shuck his inhibitions and use all his talents in the best role of his career, and a host of other fine performances enliven an Altmanesque ensemble production worth several viewings. Innovative and daring script and editing, a perfect score, hilarity, irony and moments of grace -- I haven't been this excited by a film since Malick's magnificent "The Thin Red Line".

Anyway, of course the ending has nothing to do with the PLOT, but it has everything to do with the THEME, which was the whole point of making the movie: ".......Sometimes people need to be forgiven.....".P.S.

		<shortDescription>The second best movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movies in movie theaters right now. The best film of 1999 is Being John Malkovich. But this movie is something that blew me away, even more than American Beauty. I wish I could explain the plot to you, but that would take away from the experience of the movie. I saw this movie for the first time last Thursday at 10:35, and I did not realize it was a three hour plus movie, not including previews. I would not have seen it then, and probably should have left the theater to go to bed. But I watched the whole movie, it was that good.I saw it again one week later. It was just as good. I have thought about this movie extensively since I first saw it, and still have more thinking to do. The best part of this movie is that it is not quite as obvious as American Beauty, nor does it examine the exact same topics. The movie is more about image, self-image, treatment, and truth. It is about mainly self-centered people. And, it is mainly a downer of a movie. The movie has hilarious moments, and moments that just break your heart at the same time. However, even though the length may scare some people away, those who see this movie should stay for the end of it. The ending, although trite and easily stamped together, seems to be pure genius. It wraps everything up, and does not let you forget anything.The only problem is that it seems that one story was cut out of the movie for length. There was a story with Marcie that just never comes back. Magnolia give it the first scene, but eventually you never see or hear from the characters again. Is this because the cop never hears about the story again, and we are supposed to be relating to the cop? Or is it just character development? I think that much of it was cut to shrink the film. I hope they place this in the DVD special features.The rest of the movie kept me glued to the screen, and it never gets boring. Magnolia never lets you get bored of a single story by taking you from a story for lengths of time then bringing you back. It is just the best thing about the movie.Quite a few people may have problems with the language in the film. The F-word is used incessantly because these people are not refined. None of the characters are too educated or intelligent with the exception of the people who don't swear. You will notice it in the movie. Otherwise, this is a movie which has inspired me. It has inspired me to choose my life, and to choose wisely. This movie is not for people who do not have the attention span nor the capacity to view many intertwining stories. There are so many to keep track of that many will be lost, and hate the movie. But, this is one of th few movies that I have had interesting conversations about. You can talk about the results, motivations, characterizations, and actions of all of the people in the movie. Watch it to try it. 10/10</fullReview>

Any lover of film will see the similarities between his work and the great Robert Altman,but P.T.Anderson manages to put his own twist and style into this film. I was blown away!The superb acting by Anderson's usual bunch(William H.Macy,Philip Baker Hall,Julianne Moore,Philip Sey mour Hoffman,and John C.Reilly) is gripping!Tom Cruise,well let's just say,he out does himself in his role of a motivational speaker.I won't go into detail what he talks about,but let's just say it's very interesting! The writing flows beautifully.I find it interesting how Andersons' films always deal with family ties and how we all are effected by the events that happen within them. I am amazed how he ties everything all together. We,the viewers,watch these various dramas unfold before us and witness the regret of a dying man,persons trying to seek out redemption of past deeds,those who would rather let go of the past all together,and the beauty of synchronicity! How we all, at once, could be doing something together while living our separate lives and going through our own troubles...This is an oscar worthy film!The best film of the year!</fullReview>

PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON's uncanny ability to write intricately woven stories that expose the complexity of the human condition as seen through a kaleidoscopic microcosm makes him perhaps the most promising writer and director of his generation. With a deftly selected cast by CASSANDRA KULUKUNDIS and a gorgeous soundtrack by AIMEE MANN, Anderson has shown himself a powerhouse in the making.

		<fullReview>While it may sound naive or fleeting to some, Magnolia, without QUESTION, is hands down the greatest thing I've ever seen. That's it. I'm sorry, but it's true. Paul Thomas Anderson's paramount masterpiece is the tip of Mount Everest when it comes to filmmaking, in both technical and storytelling aspects; he delivers a three hour saga about the relationships between varying parents and children, the messes they've created, and the measures it will take to make amends.The plot has been kept in shrouded secrecy for many reasons, namely one of them that it would take about fifteen minutes to give even the briefest of synopsi. There is so much going on, so much to look at, to feel, that a jaded reviewer would be damning himself and the reader if he even attempted to lay down the story. But it does concern nine people in the San Fernando Valley on a particularly dank (and particularly apocalyptic) day. But you already knew that.One of the many things that makes Magnolia flawfree is the incredible crescendo it manages to maintain for its entire running time. Scene by scene, second by second, Jon Brion's score and Aimee Mann's songs interact in perfect synchronicity with the rising emotions in the film, more and more with each following frame. Whether the situation be tense, happy, tragic, sad, mean, or something in between, the entire thing piles on more and more clumps of cinematic clay, propelling the story into the next region of genius. And with the cast, PT leaves nothing to chance. Everyone (EVERYONE!) in this picture gives 110% and more at all times. While most people will single out Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, or Bill Macy as the stars of this movie, the ones who stole MY heart were the anomalous couple of John C. Reilly and Melora "Goddess of All Things Acting" Walters. Never before have two people seemed so equally desparate for love in such different roles. Walters not only stole my heart, but the whole f***ing movie as well. Her turn as an abused, lonely, good-hearted cokehead is one of the best female characters of the last twenty years. But, I digress . ..Magnolia is a painting with colors your mind can't decipher right away, feelings that aren't easily labeled. This is why, I think, many patrons of the film have left it in bad will, because in an age of eighty-five minute Christmas gifts (not too much to think about, wrapped nicely, and pretty much predictable), filmgoers as a mass have been spoiled and cheated of films that make them *FEEL* something. Magnolia doesn't get you with clever ploys or snarky editing. It's wonder doesn't lie in its irony or one-liners. You won't find any overt sarcasm here. No, Magnolia hooks you because it makes you feel something. Its sincerity is so raw, and so spot on, that a usually sarcastic, skewered moviegoer doesn't have anything to latch on to other than its unflinching brilliance. It doesn't give any room for people to criticize it for its quality (or lack thereof), so people end up complaining about the length, the lack of immediacy, or the unconvential symbolism (ahem!).In the end though, Magnolia is nothing more than Paul Thomas Anderson's love letter to people like him. People who just plain like to watch perfection blossom right before their very eyes.*****". . .

That is what they feel like, sometimes, don't they?I must say, I was waiting for a head on collision or some disastrous coincidence of a monumental scale, but was shocked, amazed, bewildered and, ultimately thrilled by what some deem a pretentious "deus es machina," which it was on some levels.

		<shortDescription>A breathtaking, surrealistic, heartrending cacophony of emotion and audacity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director-producer Paul Thomas Anderson, of Boogie Nights fame, has fashioned an astonishingly good movie here. Indeed, it's something to be treasured for a long time to come. It is hard to articulate how much this film has affected me since seeing it. More so than any other in 99, this defined going to the movies for me, and it's also my personal pic for the best film of that year.Anderson begins this story with a brilliant prologue, narrated by Ricky Jay, telling of some famous urban legends. Three in fact. These anecdotes appear to have nothing to do with the rest of thing, and they don't really. It's only upon reaching the end of the film that we fully understand the purpose of this narration. It sets up the film's themes obliquely yet specifically, and it does, contrary to some peoples' opinion, set the stage perfectly for a climactic event that occurs late in the picture.There are nine main characters in this film. Some of them are: Earl and Linda Partridge (Jason Robards and Julianne Moore), Earl's estranged son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise); a kindly police officer; a gameshow host, and his coke-addicted daughter. These random characters have seemingly little connection, but as the intro suggests, they are united in their emotions and in a few other surprising way. The acting in this film is nearly beyond compare. Tom Cruise fashions a dynamic, enigmatic, not always likeable portrayal of a misogynist who gives seminars on how to "seduce and destroy" women. His sexual passion and unbridled attractiveness is on full display here. Thankfully, since his erotic charms are usually kept below the surface. Here, he's allowed to truly shine for the first time in his career. It's forceful, gutsy, and entirely believable. Jason Robards lends a quiet dignity to Earl, as we see a dying man looking back upon the regrets of his life. Julianne Moore is terrific in a demanding role that makes her seem as if she's either manic or angry, when in fact she is simply struggling with complex emotions. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the man's nurse, lends a beautifully tuned humanity to the proceedings, and is one of the sources of hope present throughout the film. This has been likened to Robert Altman's cynical "Short Cuts", but I feel "Magnolia" outclasses it in both its more logical tone and in its emotional veracity. Melora Walters is an absolute amazement as Claudia, the drug-addled daughter of the quiz show host. She's strung-out, lonely, looking for love....To give much about the plot or character development of the film would be ruinous. Thus, I will expound upon the structural and directorial achievements of this visionary film. PTA's dazzling work with the camera is apparent too, as he weaves complex camera shots in and out of these tortured lives. His film is giddy, almost drunk of the pure notion of making movies. Because of this, there is an unfettered, gloriously inventive energy to "Magnolia", which keeps it fresh and entertaining. The direction here is at turns forceful and gentle. That Anderson can balance both the complex storyline and emotional truthfulness over the length of a 190-minute film is a pure accomplishment. He creates something sad, poetic, beautiful, courageously moving, and ultimately, important with this film. It's more than a simple trip or slice-of-life. For one day, we see inside the lives of a group of San Fernando Valley residents in all their maniacal dysfunction. IN doing this, he also tells us much about the world as a whole, in ways both quiet and loud. He's gifted with an ear for dialogue, and it certainly helps him here, where everyday conversation forms the backdrop to big life issues, such as parental abuse, incest, drug addiction, hope, and the fragility of life.Now, many people have been talking about the unexpected ending of this film, which I will not reveal for surprise purposes. These people call the ending superfluous or out-of-the-blue, which is completely nonsensical. To answer these, I will state that there are more than 3 references in the film to the climactic event, sprinkled in hidden signs and such. In addition, the ending is set up purely in its TONE from the first frame of the film, in which the coincidental? urban legends are discussed. By ending his film in a unifying thread of uncontrollable storm, Anderson provides a parallel and example to his points. The film is trying to tell us how the life we see around us is so fragile that it's sometimes useless to plan for the future, when all it does is come down in a way that proves there's something greater turning the gears. Yet, through it all, the hope survives. We first see the glimmer as the cast breaks into song at Aimee Mann's luminous "Wise Up", which unites the characters in misery, pain, and grief. Aimee Mann's songs were the backbone to this film, and it shows. They fit the tone and idealism of the film perfectly. The ending of the movie, after the cataclysmic event, proves that the event is no mere indulgence or folly. Anderson has a real point to make here. He says that although we can't know the future or its nuances, we always have to pick ourselves up and keep going. It's perhaps a message that's been heard before, but never in such a raucous, sad, inventive, joyous celebration of imagery. "Magnolia" is at turns heartwarming, unbearably sad, and hilariously human. It's as if it knows all our souls fully. It picks up the subtle connection between ALL people, and it's why the film works so well at pulling its disparate characters together.The final scene of the film, over which plays Mann's stunningly haunting "Save Me", is a scene so full of grace, harmony, and hope, that I burst out crying right in the theater. It's a scene of magic, and it proves everything else in the film. In fact, I think it's one of the finest ending shots in motion picture history. Rarely has the message of a work been so clear and so beautiful in a single moment. This movie's fearless boldness and its true sincerity are welcome additions in this age of irony. Here is a director going for broke, and as was not the case with "American Beauty", everything really DOES come up roses, in a blooming metaphor of life and emotion, of sadness and triumph. The best film of 1999!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "American Beauty", I thought that it was the best movie of the year and I was sure that nothing better will come along. On December 25, this movie was launched. It was a limited release but two weeks later there was a wider release. If I would have known how good this movie was, I would have watched on Christmas Day. I saw "Boogie Nights" and I was very impressed, but nothing, and I do mean nothing prepared me for this movie. There are four things that I love in this movie. The first is the prologue, which is very original and clever.The second towards the middle of the movie, is the very interesting idea, when everyone sings. I do not believe that someone did something similar. Probably Aimee Mann (the composer of the songs) felt really special.The third thing is the cast. The performers work together so well and none of them steals scenes, which will be a major problem for the Oscars, because there are no main characters and there are no secondary characters. Everyone is important. Jason Robards, as Earl Partridge, looks entirely believable as a dying man of cancer. His wife, Linda, played by Julianne Moore, is extraordinary as a woman who never loved her husband but now when she sees him in such bad shape, starts to care for him and feels unworthy near him. His male nurse, Phil (played by one of my favourite actors: Philip Seymour Hoffman) loves his employer and goes to impossible length to reunite him with his estranged son, Frank. Frank is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best roles ever. He is amazing as a misogynist TV guru, who built his entire life on his hate for his father and who slowly crumbles when a reporter interviews him and then confronted with his father. Philip Baker Hall is wonderful as a TV game show host who is also dying of cancer and his daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), who hates her father for molesting her. John C. Reilley is very subdued as a lone policeman who falls instantly in love with Claudia. And finally William H. Macy, who is always a pleasure to watch, makes a remarkable approach to his character, Donny, who had been a winner of the aforementioned show thirty years ago. Now he is a pathetic loser who works in a furniture shop and who wants braces to be attractive to an utterly gorgeous male bartender, who by the way wears braces. In the end, Donny is really going to need braces.Finally, I saved the best for last. Remember the ending from "Boogie Nights"? Were you shocked? Well, I will not reveal anything important, but "Magnolia"'s ending is far better. I felt like being on rollercoaster for the first time when you feel nauseous and sick and breathless. You want to stop but somehow you also want to go on. That's how I felt. I have seen hundreds maybe thousands of movies and this one is not a horror, a thriller or science fiction, which should be able to make me feel like that. I never felt this way while watching another movie. "Magnolia" is a miracle.I never did this before, but I am profoundly grateful to P.T. Anderson for creating this masterpiece. Thank You!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER be careful but this movie is genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of Boogie Nights and I thought that it was an incredibly well directed piece. I had to see Magnolia and when I finally got the chance, I was taken by the prologue as well as the development of the characters and the plot. I also loved the music and the tone of the movie. This is the first time I have seen a flick in a long time that I have enjoyed the soundtrack so much that I wanted to buy it. It is no surprise that these people are intimately involved with Fiona Apple. As far as the movie goes, I was too slow to catch the Exodus 8:2 reference w/ the frogs, but even for a realist like me, upon explanation, I realized that the film was fantastic. Incredibly well acted, directed, and written. Extremely creative, and I love the fact that I can after all trust the director and actors to lead me to a quality film. I agree with those who argue that this, like Kubrick's final masterpiece Eyes Wide Shut, is a movie that will be lauded in about twenty years. And notice Tom Cruise on a hot streak! I love seeing quality in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo, Mr. Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read over the user comments of IMDB, I have come to the sad realization that the modern American ideal of mindless entertainment and passive voyeurism in the movies is so deeply imbedded that the second a filmmaker has the audacity to challenge us, to ask us to think about what we have seen for ourselves, we lash back with allegations that the film was a waste of time. And since we all seem to think that ours is the final word in the never-ending debate on a film's greatness (or lack thereof), we type warnings in big, bold letters, as if our words will somehow make the director think twice before doing something of this sort again. Honestly, have we not grown tired of films that cater to us, that underestimate our intelligence and wrap everything up in a nice, neat package. "Magnolia" is certainly a film that requires the viewer to become an active participant in the determining meaning of the film. It is a film that does not cater to the conventions of the classic narrative, but rather follows its nine different storylines in different directions. And just when you think these stories are drifting further and further apart, Anderson creates a climax of such inspired originality my jaw literally dropped. This ending has recieved alot of criticism. People seem to think that simply because a scene has nothing to do with the plot or plots, it is merely a cop-out thrown in by someone who was unsure of what to do. Since when do films have to follow a single plot for 3 hours? Why is it such a crime to create an ending that, while alluded to, is entirely unexpected, and asks the viewer to judge for him or herself just what it "means"? People don't seem to want a challenge anymore. They don't want to see something that breaks cinematic convention. 25 years ago, we applauded filmmakers such as Coppola, Scorsese, and Allen for doing essentially the same thing Anderson is doing today: Taking what is known in the cinema, and turning it inside-out.The difficulty it takes to make a picture such as this within the confines of the Hollywood mainstream is grounds enough to hail "Magnolia" as a towering achievment. That it was done with such skill, energy, and originality is enough to claim that "Magnolia" is, as I believe, one of the great American films of the past 25 years. Bravo, Mr. Anderson, for making a film that dared to be smarter than the people in the audience. Bravo, for making us think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson has done it again. He creates a mosaic of people who live in the San Fernando Valley. All the characters are interesting and well-acted. Anderson follows in the footsteps of Robert Altman structuring a film similar to Nashville and Short Cuts. The film has very great visuals and a really wonderful soundtrack.AND THEN THE ENDINGIt may seem unrealistic, but it has happened. It is a brilliant ending.The film itself is not for everyone's taste. I said the same thing when I review Short Cuts. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a SMASHING (in possibly more ways than one) new film that deserves award credit. Made for those that enjoy INTELLIGENT film, I feel Magnolia is brilliantly made and worthy of viewing by die-hard film connoisseurs. Though full of often hard-to-swallow circumstances for those that are easily offended or not a fan of epic-length film, it is crammed full of detailed detailed detailed plot scenario. Sure to be a classic (maybe even cult-film classic), it is one that any fan of film in the serious minded sense should not miss. In melancholy or even what some might call depressing situations humor (sometimes the kind you're not supposed to laugh at) lurks.This is a film that some did exit the theater laggingly about mid-point, but far more stayed to finish. Its a judgement call only each individual can make... I highly suggest Magnolia for any true fan of the cinema.</fullReview>

Like Boogie Nights, it's not for anyone easily offended by vulgar language. But in the end, it shows that some behaviors are even more vulgar than the worst four letter words, and have impacts that are much more devastating. Definitely one of the best films of the last 12 months. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Magnolia, I was blown away. The interlocking stories and characters are too much to go into in this forum, and the best way to experience them is not by reading someone else's account of it, but by actually viewing the film. Paul Thomas Anderson outdoes himself with this sprawling tale of ten characters on one wild weather day in the San Fernando Valley. The acting from this group is top notch, and the camera work and editing employed reminds me of Martin Scorsese's films. The film is like its title, it blossoms as you watch. We start out with each character and slowly, the story begins to unfold and it will all make sense at the end. As I stated before, it's best to view this film rather than read about someone else's account. Do not be put off by the running time, it's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day That Aimee Mann Met Charles Fort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to Boogie Nights, is not a movie for everyone. If you hope to see the cookie cutter at work, are looking to get the standard type of movie the stays on the tracks of your expectations, this one isn't for you. If, on the other hand you're looking for a movie that takes some risks, is innovative while at the same time resonates with a certain joy that lures us to the movies in the first place, one that might demand that you view it more than once, read on.Set in contemporary San Fernando Valley, Magnolia cuts and weaves its magic by following the actions of a cast of characters over the course of a day as they attempt to gain control of their lives while, in many cases, struggling with the past; the past, here, often involves the effect parents have on their children's lives as those lives wander, run, or free fall into the future. The boy genius, the ex-boy genius, the game show host, his daughter, the policeman who falls in love with her, the dying man, his wife, his caretaker, and his lost son: these characters might well be figures in a Tarot deck gone wrong--rather than forming a connection to the future, they live in a constant struggle with a past that isn't through with them. Two characters, the police officer and the caretaker are of a somewhat different cut than the others, having made it to the present with gentler souls, still able to give of themselves despite whatever shortcomings they may have. All are played with great energy and verve by a cast that includes many members of the casts of Anderson's two previous films, Hard Eight (aka Sydney) and Boogie Nights. It is Magnolia's editing that makes this film what it is, allowing it to reach its peaks and giving us a small valley to deal with. On first view, the cuts from scene to scene may leave the viewer breathless; upon a second viewing we can relax a bit and watch carefully how this film moves like a fish darting quickly and gracefully from point to point. It is clear that material from one thread of this three-hour-plus movie unfortunately didn't make it to the finished product. This will happen under the pressure of audiences expecting a pat two hours. Magnolia is a fitting end to the first century of cinema, a film that evokes a sense of the unexpected, both in the dawning of a new millennium (or millennium to be) and the potential dawning of a new age of cinema. If, a hundred or more years from now, people still ask questions of themselves such as "What and who can I forgive?", "Who can and will help me through life's desolate and forbidding paths?" "Can I possibly plan for the future when the present is so unclear, haunted as it is by the past?" then they will enjoy this movie as we can today as well as appreciate its position in the history of cinema. . . . Oh yes, Aimee and Charles. She is a singer-songwriter whose songs, heard in nascent form by Anderson, provided the springboard for the characters and their stories. The songs themselves, glistening, Beatlesque pop/rock concertos, are used boldly by Anderson at a number of key points in the film. He was . . . well, some would call him a crackpot, others a prophet of the unexplained. Writing in the first third of the twentieth century, he produced four books of nonfiction detailing reports from around the world of strange phenomena: unusual atmospheric conditions, people with bizarre abilities, animals hailing down from the sky, and so forth. Often, he would present these accounts without attempt at explanation, pushing them out to the audience just so they would see that these things do occur. What sort of a movie results from a director of Anderson's talent making bedfellows of these two? I highly recommend that you go see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST FILM of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson has solidified his reputation as the best young director out there with this film. Hell, I'd almost go so far as to say the best director period. Boogie Nights was a brilliant little piece of cinematic pie, but this movie is downright genius. The movie is all story, yet there is no single plot to speak of. Every character is central and perfectly developed, but their stories can only exist as a whole. Some have a problem with this fluid style of filmmaking, but I think it's revolutionary. It seems every movie since Pulp Fiction has been a time warp of sorts, moving from one point of a story, to another, and then back. But this movie betters by a mile any previous 90's style because it doesn't resort to cheap gimmickry, and relies solely on heart.Magnolia is a film in the classic sense but is so perfectly in-tune with this era and the emotional baggage we all carry around. I saw things in this movie that I never could have imagined I'd see in any thing but cheap indie films, but this one definitely ranks as a classic by any standards. All the performances are top-notch, but I'd like to give special recognition to those of Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly, and the beautiful Melora Walters. I LOVE THIS FILM. Of course, I realize that some will loathe this film (especially it's 3+ hour runtime), but I found every moment crucial and wonderful. This is a human film; it appeals to the emotions that we all share. I suppose only time will tell, though, why some so connected with this grandiose work while others despised it. Yet, I remain firm in my opinion that this is a marvellous work that will be remembered for decades as a landmark film in 21st Century CINEMA. BRAVO to all those involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible film that deals with love, hate, death, forgiveness, repentance, lack of forgiveness and repentance - and falling toads. I was stunned by it (although the lady next to me kept complaining in a loud voice that she was bored), and I've found myself thinking about it repeatedly in the last several days. The acting was wonderful, and I was particularly surprised by Tom Cruise, who can actually act and does a fantastic job here. Most of the other actors are people who have long been dismissed as "character actors," which in Hollywood parlance means that they really CAN act, and for once they have parts written for them that they do beautifully. Everybody was spectacular. Some of the characters, such as Donnie, the aging former quiz-kid who is yearning for the dumb blond bartender hunk, and the naive, earnest cop who doesn't even notice that the girl he has been smitten with is rushing off to snort coke every few minutes, are so painfully touching that it is hard to watch them. And then there's the strung out younger wife who's finally, at the last minute, come to love her rich, older husband, who was a jerk of the first water and abandoned his first wife and son, who...well, you get the idea. Complicated, enormously human, full of great scenes and little one liners and visual jokes that shoot right by if you're not paying attention. Some people left because they were bored, and some people left clucking because they did not approve of the language (f*** is a one-word thesaurus for these characters, used to express virtually any emotion or thought). But those of us who stayed left feeling that we'd seen what movies really should be, novelistic in depth, thought-provoking without being message-driven, and at the same time primarily visual experiences. Great job! Even if you don't like it, you're going to think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia was an absolute brilliant blend of just about everything I've ever wanted in a film. The drama was there, the comedy was there, and the surreal was definitely there.Instead of giving away anything about the actual story, I'd rather comment on the characters for the most part. As a high school actor, how the characters are played is something I focus on greatly. In this *cinematic masterpiece,* the actors were not playing the characters. Instead, the actors BECAME the characters, making the film much more enjoyable. There was not one bad performance in the film, and another thing that made it good was that there truly was no main character.I just saw this movie for the first time minutes ago, and I'm definitely going to have to see it again. While it's a long movie (a bit more then 3 hours), you never will get bored, as something big will always be happening. Once again, Magnolia is the perfect blend of what a film should be, and I suggest that everyone go see it.</fullReview>

The climax is shocking and perfect unlike anything you will ever see in cinema.Paul Anderson has done what few directors can do. He's created a movie that puts forth a point first, then it entertains perfectly in the midst. Don't like that kind of movie? Fine, go watch senseless action or romantic comedy.Kubrick did it, and now Anderson has done it. Magnolia is unmatched.</fullReview>

Impossible to predict yet finely woven, hugely moral without feeling moralizing, a long chain of characters, but each one well-developed and compelling. This is one of those rare and amazing movies that stretches and redefines the meaning and function of feature film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's "Magnolia" is a chock-full-o-everything. A little bit of humour, a lot of heart-tugging, and some flat out zaniness. It surely doesn't hit all notes, but it makes up for its flaws with its stupendous acting. Cruise is very good, as is Jason Robards, and basically the whole cast does a fine job. It gets a little self-indulgent during the second hour(perhaps Anderson should learn how to edit a little tighter), and at times it seems like a drippy melodramatic soap opera, full of many maudlin moments. Overall though, I would have to recommend it. If for nothing else, atleast it makes you think upon departure from the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson enters the big time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, it took me awhile to sort this out since when I saw the movie, the projector broke down during the climax of the film, and then again after only a couple of seconds of film(all told, the last 15 minutes or so of movie took about 45 minutes to show). Nevertheless, I think I can say that this is an excellent film and that writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson proves he's ready for the big time.I can understand why some people don't like this film, aside from the ones who complain about its overlength(to them, I quote the late Gene Siskel, who said good movies are never too long, while bad movies always are). This is a film about characters who, for the most part, wear their hearts on their sleeve, or play for big emotions, and if done badly, that can slide into soap opera. But Anderson doesn't go for safe choices here, and his audaciousness, and skill, make those emotions ring true. The theme of how TV has corrupted the lives of most of the characters could be too symbolic, but that's handled well, particularly in the shots of Claudia(Melora Walters) crying while watching the game show her father(Philip Baker Hall) hosts.Of course, the cast deserves a lot of mention. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and Melora Walters have gotten a lot of praise for their performances, and justifiably so. But Philip Baker Hall, who did such a terrific job in Anderson's first film, HARD EIGHT, also deserves praise as Jimmy Gator, the game show host. He has some big dramatic moments, having to play someone who gets sick on air, and handles them without going over the top. And his scenes with his wife(Melinda Dillon, also excellent) are heartbreaking. And Jeremy Blackman is not only convincing as the boy genius, but also at showing the unhappiness underneath(SPOILER ALERT: when the major characters sing along to Aimee Mann's "Wise Up" near the end, he and Walters seem to connect most to it. END SPOILER ALERT). Anderson is showing himself to be a major director, and while HARD EIGHT and BOOGIE NIGHTS showed potential, this film shows him realizing it.</fullReview>

Those are the people who thrive ONLY on countless action films, dirt stupid comedy films, and such and don't like it when somebody comes along with a new movie thats different from all the rest.Don't be persuaded to not see this movie. If you like intelligent movies, movies about humanity, movies with good camera work and cinematography or movies with meaning then like me, the 3 hours will fly by and you'll enjoy watching the thousands of creative scene transitions.As an added note. Most films that try to break something new become totally controversial and you'll hear only bad things about them. In time you will look back and see that this movie changed the industry. Look at all of Kubrick's films. ALL ground breaking films that changed the way intelligent movies are made.There are a lot of negative comments on this site. The only way to decide whether or not you'll like a movie is to see it first. On this movie stop researching it, and go see it before you start hearing things about it.Thank You</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(*WARNING* DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE) Paul Thomas Anderson, whose explosive film "BOOGIE NIGHTS" is probably one of the best of the decade, almost out-does himself with his latest masterpiece. He is definitely a filmmaker worth watching. What especially liked about this movie, aside from the great cast and great music, is the way that Anderson subtly inserted objects that can only be seen if attention is paid. One example is the painting of the magnolia in Philip Baker Hall's character's house, under which it states the movie's theme, revealed during the climax: "Things like this have happened" or something like that. No one would have been able to catch that, had attention not been paid. Also, I had difficulty trying to figure out what Jason Robard's character, Earl Partridge, and the rest of his family had to do with the game show "What Do Kids Know?", until I saw the end credits of the t.v. show where it said that it was a "Big Earl Partridge" production in big letters. That's the only way to actually link all the character's stories together. I saw the movie with three people and I was the only one to catch that. The last thing I would like to say is to all the people who say that when it started raining frogs, it didn't make any sense. If you think that, then you didn't understand any of the movie and you wasted three hours of your life that could've been spent on an absolutely amazing movie-going experience.</fullReview>

But on the printed page, such elements are standard. Why not expect such sleight-of-hand on the screen? Yeah it's not perfect. But it's engrossing, phenomenally well acted, and exceedingly haunting.

		<shortDescription>Perfection Ensemble Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late in the decade, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson delivers the definitive ensemble cinematic masterpiece of the 90's, perhaps the best of it's genre since Altman's "Nashville". It's foundation, of course, is the story line ? in this case lines; a multitude of characters, all sharing different aspects of a central theme of `child and parent', hurtling toward their individual destinations. Each character, and their individual, or sometimes shared, story, is strong and captivating. The hand of God reached down and touched Hollywood when this film was cast. It would take volumes to praise the cast individually ? indeed, the entire cast, for this is an actor's movie and all the actor's meet and surpass expectations, working at their peak, stretching their muscles, and gambling with their talents. And they all shine. You just don't find this any more.I must mention, individually, three members of the cast. Two relative newcomers, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters both will undoubtedly receive Oscar nominations. You'll be reading a lot about them from anyone who reviews the movie. Allow me to focus on the third actor, Tom Cruise. Playing against type, Tom continues his evolution from `male ingénue' to `upcoming' to `movie star' to `actor'. The promise seen in `Rain Man', and subsequent roles, has been kept. In `Magnolia', Tom forsakes star status, joins the ensemble and delivers a powerhouse performance as the adult product of a most unique childhood. Alone, he is worth the price of admission. On the technical end, all is flawless with lighting and sound at the forefront. Anderson, who both wrote and directed this morality tale, takes you on a cinematic journey filled with unexpected twists which literally take your breath away. You've never seen a film quite like this. Bravo! One of the best films of this or any year.</fullReview>

His latest epic takes the viewer for a thrill ride through the interconnected lives of lost souls searching for a way to make things right. Set in the San Fernando Valley, Anderson puts these wonderfully talented and gifted actors (many of them have appeared in Anderson's two previous films, Hard Eight and Boogie Nights) in unique and realistic situations and the result is not just an ordinary film but a mere cinematic experience. If you are a student or fan of films and filmmaking, then you should be thankful that you can witness this true talent. Come Oscar time, Anderson and his cast and crew all should be rewarded. Thank you Paul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is a gut-punch of a movie ... quite a bleak vision. I know there's been Oscar buzz around it, and I think it deserves award attention, but I think it might be WAY too dark for the "Shakespeare in Love" crowd. The ensemble acting is excellent all the way around, but Jason Robards is given the most powerful monologue in the film, and he nails it brilliantly. The movie itself is too long and flawed in many ways; however, this might sound strange, but I think the flaws actually add to the power of the film. The first hour seems to ramble a bit, but there is a method to the madness when all the pieces fall together in the second hour, leading up to a twist near the end that is absurd, silly, and strangely brilliant at the same time. "Magnolia" the film is a lot like life itself: long stretches where nothing happens, balanced by sudden bizarre moments, pain, and hopefully forgiveness. Deep thoughts, yes, but it's a deep experience. I can't seem to purge this movie out of my head, it's that haunting.</fullReview>

The biggest problem is that you have to watch a three hour film which has nothing really to show except from stupid boring symbolisms, there is no imagination here, just the worst spending time of my life. At the end, i got to give an advice to the director. Pls mate, just do another job, you have no sense to entertain the humanity, you have no talent. Sorry, its true.

		<shortDescription>An Insult To Magnolia Trees Everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" was supposed to be my new favorite film. I had just watched "Crash" (2005) and "Shortcuts" (1993) and was looking for more 'hypertext cinema' movies. When I heard about this film and its "epic mosaic" of various Los Angeles characters, I couldn't wait to watch it. Now, I wish I could get my three hours back. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.One of the things I hated most about it was that the opening 30 minutes was amazingly great. It starts off epic and all goes downhill from there. We are shown three urban legends, followed by an introduction of all the characters set to Three Dog Night's "One". We see a game show host (Philip Baker Hall), a kid contestant (Jeremy Blackman), a former contestant now an adult (William H. Macy), a dying man (Jason Robards), his gold digging wife (Julianne Moore), his nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his estranged womanizing son (Tom Cruise), an LAPD officer (John C. Reilly), and the crack head he goes on a date with.The story, you ask? There was no story. Just random people saying the f-word over and over again. At first it was just boring, but then it became painful to watch. It doesn't help that these are the dumbest characters I have ever seen. There wasn't a single action done by them that was realistic. From the kid who pees his pants instead of going to a bathroom, to the wife who barely reacts when she finds out her husband molested their daughter. None of the people were interesting and the film gave me no reason to care about them. The last 20 minutes of the story goes from boring to completely absurd. The route Paul Thomas Anderson decides to go is way too gimmicky. Without giving too much away, he ended the movie in a way that had no point and proceeded to make the entire film pointless.In the end, there was no closure. None of the characters connected in any noticeable way. Nobody ended up changing. I had so many questions that I could have filled up the entire discussion boards with them, if I cared enough to find out the answers, which I didn't. The message isn't even clear, which is a big problem if your film is supposed to be a 'message movie'. The best I can come up with is: "You can't change the past, so learn from it, no matter how bad you are". Mr. Anderson thinks he is so revolutionary, but it's the exact same moral as "The Lion King", except five times more cynical.My film studies teacher once asked me what I thought of the "brilliant ending" (her words) and I responded: "I was still trying to figure out why Julianne Moore was cursing in the pharmacy earlier". This movie was two hours too long and far too unfocused, not to mentioned pretentious. Paul Thomas Anderson thinks he is so clever with his symbolic use of numbers, age-old twists, and shallow philosophy, even though they had been done before.Was there anything redeeming about the movie? Well, the soundtrack by Aimee Mann was great, both her songs and the tracks by other artists, but it was so overbearing and out of place at times that I could barely make out the dialog. John C. Reilly's police officer character was good, but he kept making ridiculously stupid decisions over and over. I kept wondering if I would like to see any of the segments expanded into its own film, I couldn't think a single one that I would pay to see.This is not a good film. This is an impostor of a film, something terrible masquerading as profound. I am a fan of 'alternate' movies and consider myself intelligent, so don't think that is the problem. I can almost bet that people who love this movie have no reason why they like it, they just do. Magnolia is a movie for cinema snobs who know everything about movies, except how to enjoy them. All in all, I want my money back and I didn't even pay to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few perfect films I have seen, and the best at that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of two of Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpieces, the other being There Will Be Blood. I personally love every single solitary frame of this movie. I love the acting, I love the cinematography, I love the lighting (this is one of the few films that I actually notice lighting in) and I love the emotion, the intense, beautiful emotion. Magnolia is a spectacular mosaic of beauty, forgiveness, sadness, and love. Every second of Magnolia expresses a certain sympathy and sadness, as well as care. The acting is commendable, especially on the part of Tom Cruise. I happen to be one of the seemingly few people who find Cruise to be a fantastic actor. And in this movie, he shines. His performance, like Day-Lewis' performance in There Will Be Blood, is stunning. In a climactic scene near the end of Magnolia, he breaks down in tears beside his father, and the emotions expressed through his eyes, his mouth, and his hands, are nothing short of captivating. Like Aronofsky's 'The Fountain', this movie makes me cry at multiple times throughout it, every single time. And it's because of the depth, and the beauty of the whole spectacle. You come to care for each of the many characters, and feel sympathy for all of them. As Tom Cruise shouts in hatred at his dying father, you feel for both Cruise's character and for the dying father, as well as Hoffman's character, in the corner, watching. As he watches, and I only speak for myself here, his emotions reflect my own, both of us observing, and feeling sympathy and sadness for both sides of the ordeal. The dialogue is beautifully composed, as well as performed. The music also makes every second of the film climactic, and it should be. All the actions in the film are important to help us understand the characters, inside and out. The film's timing is perfect, and had it been shorter than it was, contrary to what some impatient film-goers say, it would have been lesser. It would have lowered the quality of the overall film. This film is the greatest film I have ever seen, and I've seen every Coen movie, every Nolan movie, Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane, and many Scorsese films. I say that this is the best movie I've ever seen, knowing the quality of those films, and acknowledging that this film is deeper, more human, and more intensely emotional than any movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed But Fantastic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I've been on a Paul Thomas Anderson run. In anticipation of The Master (Which I still haven't seen!) I've been revisiting his other movies, and now truly believe him to be among the greatest directors of today. Boogie Nights was simply incredible, and even Hard Eight showed a lot of potential in the filmmaker, despite an apparently terrible editing process. Then there's Magnolia. Such a strange movie, but at the same time it's the most familiar.If I had to sum up Magnolia, I'd say it's about life. With that, comes all of the sadness, all of the humor, and joy of life. Make no mistake, all of these emotions and more are fully fleshed out in Magnolia. Each character has his and her moments of triumph, of defeat, and of complete confusions as to the meaning of their current predicament. And are there characters.With such a star-studded cast you can easily see that this movie could've flopped. Talent-overload. Under the direction of Anderson, there's no reason for worry. Each character has their screen-time, and is allowed to develop before our eyes as the day progresses. Tom Cruise as the sleazy "self-help" misogynist, spewing sexist propaganda at his seminars. Making his interviewer uncomfortable as he bounces around, maybe on drugs. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse to a dying Jason Robards, and the confused and seemingly bipolar Julianne Moore as Robards' wife. There are just too many characters to fully describe in a coherent review. Though, John C Reilly's character simply must be acknowledged. Playing a good cop, Reilly channels humor into his lines, and yet he's just such a nice guy. Innocent, but not stupidly so. Another great performance comes from young Jeremy Blackman, a pre-teen "whiz kid" who is used by his father as a source of income. William H Macy as the disgruntled employee who used to be that whiz kid... See what I'm saying? The list goes on and on, and all of these performances are just perfect.The idea of swapping between these characters is, like I said, a seemingly impossible task. But Anderson switches it up frequently enough that we feel enough exposition on one character and are ready to see where the other is at this point. It's addicting, almost like following a TV show.Performances aside, we all know Paul Thomas Anderson is a technical genius. Employing his trademark long takes in several breathtaking scenes, this is very much an Anderson film. Smart writing, great camera-work, and a varied soundtrack are all now signatures of Anderson.I did mention some flaws. Mind you, these in no way major flaws but I found them distracting. Notably, two I can think of. The first is a scene later on in the movie. A song by Aimee Mann plays and the camera cuts to the main characters, all sitting in their homes in a state of sadness. They all sing along to the song. To me, this makes it clear that this is a movie, these are actors. It takes you out of the drama. Especially for a movie so rooted in deep emotion, this is a distraction. I just thought it was kind of silly, and unnecessary. They could've had the song playing and shots of the character sitting quietly and that would've been just as dramatic.My second complaint isn't entirely a complaint, just a remark. The frogs. I went into the movie knowing about the ending, so I wasn't surprised by it. I bet I would've been more surprised and disappointed had I not known. It just seems like another wild thing that takes you out of the realism of the rest of the film. I understand and like the theme of random, strange, unexplainable incidents, but I think frogs is just too far-fetched. Though perhaps that's the point? Maybe Anderson is making fun of his own thematic devices. I don't know, maybe I just don't understand the movie entirely.But really, don't let my little complaints change your mind. Even the frogs, which are undeniably bizarre, can't change the fact that the film up until that point is a work of brilliance, and it would be a disservice for a film-lover to pass on this just because of the ending. Magnolia is a masterpiece. A combination of human emotion and a love and talent for filmmaking. I'd say it's very close to being a perfect movie. You owe it to yourself to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not gonna lie, this is easily in my top 3. I must admit, the first time I was introduced to this film, I hated it, with passion. I may have even ranted for one or ...five hours. ("Something something, capitalist agenda something something" if my memory serves me... and possibly a few swear words thrown in...).But then I returned to it some years later (yes, that's how much I hated it) and discovered a whole other genius to this movie. The more I watch it, the more I discover. I don't think there has been a time when I've sat down to watch Magnolia and not learned something new.Magnolia magnifies the connections between seven main characters, how each affects each other and how their lives will be irrevocably changed in a single day. Parents and children reach crossroads and sins will be revealed.It's mindblogging to think that old mate P.T. Anderson was only 29 years old when he made this triumph in cinema. And like each director of the other films on this list, Anderson's skew is so deliciously unique that whether you enjoy Magnolia or not, it will definitely leave an impression with you. This film divides audiences; people either love it and defend it with honour or hate it with livid frustration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is Paul Thomas Anderson's third film and has a great cast including - Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Phillip Baker Hall and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. - It chronicles the lives of several interrelated characters with intertwining story lines and how they live in America. After Boogie Nights, P.T Anderson had to improve on that, which was going to be hard to do considering how good Boogie Nights was. Now, Magnolia isn't better. But it is still pretty amazing. I enjoyed every minute of it and I found some scenes to be some of the most powerful scenes ever displayed in film history. I found the camera-work unbelievable and surprisingly, the acting was pretty good from everyone including Tom Cruise. The writing was great and considering it was written on such a large scale with so many characters and subplots, it never had any inconsistencies and always kept me interested.The characters were well-written and made me emotionally interested in them, their fates and their conclusions. It is a tiny bit too long and maybe one or two of the stories are a bit dragged out. But if you don't like it, you have to at least appreciate it and I did. I really did. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great writer and director, and this is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite only seeing this film for the first time a few months ago, Magnolia instantly became one of my all-time favourites and in my opinion, one of the best of the 1990's. Anderson's epic study of some of the most basic human themes (the family, love, regret, loneliness, illness, death) weaves together a group of characters as they live out their lives in LA over the course of a single day.Beginning with a prologue where the narrator (Ricky Jay) recounts three strange tales of intangible coincidence, Magnolia shows us a varied and flawed ensemble of characters, portrayed perfectly by the likes of Tom Cruise, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C Reilly, William H Macy, Julianne Moore, Melora Waters, Jason Robards and Jeremy Blackman among others. The first half of the picture is really concerned with developing the characters, as Anderson moves seamlessly from character to character, showing the audience the most intimate and tortured aspects of their lives. We may only see a day in their lives but Anderson is not afraid to delve deep into these characters' fractured lives to show the grief, loss, and sadness that has dominated them. Meanwhile Anderson explores the prominent theme of coincidence and chance, the narrator at the beginning muses that strange things happen all the time and occur every single day. This is apparent in the film; it must coincidence that the same day Frank Mackey has a probing interview about his early life, he has contact from his long-lost father, it must be coincidence that Jim Kunning's gun is stolen by the same boy he encountered earlier the same day, and of course, the freak weather occurrence that concludes the film is simply one of those strange things that happens for a reason, it redeems and/or judges all of the main characters. While obvious comparisons to films like Short Cuts and Crash can be drawn, Magnolia is unique for its effortless direction, superb ensemble cast and insight into the human condition. A must-see for everyone, 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia explores nothing less than the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is part poem, part jungle blossom, all brilliance. Residents in Los Angeles San Fernando valley experience a day of strange coincidence, heightened emotion and freak weather.The film is an astounding and often breathtaking achievement, criss-crossing between disparate-yet-connected story lines with great fluency and tremendous verve, building towards a perfectly controlled examination of those elements in life we cannot control. Director Paul Thomas Anderson proves as skilled a human dramatist as he is with the cinematic tools of music and editing: conducted in three hours of what feels more or less real time, the film never lets up its grip, and there are moments that are simply unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether it be true or not, I will always see this as the one "dream film"; despite PTA's long lived passion laying with porn, thus his Boogie Nights. Yet, he himself does call Magnolia his masterpiece. A perfect ensemble piece. Spanning for over 3 hours, PTA manages to create a satisfying amount of screen-time and depth to all his characters; all strong characters might I add. All of them are so interesting and involving. I'm not saying with that length its a hard thing to do, but he does keep it impressively even. It's a personal experience, rich with its own personal qualities and simple elements. From the choice of music to entire flow of the film. Magnolia is exactly the kind of film I wish to accomplish, or at least, dream about making. PTA makes it look so easy, which only increases the hope (beautifully illustrated by Quiz Kid Donnie Smith's favourite song). Magnolia is full to the brim of exactly what I want. It's cinematic epicness is breath-taking upon every viewing. One of the most rewarding films ever made, which could grant it a worthy top spot. Paul Thomas Anderson deserves an award for his direction, not only of the year but for all-time. He swoops and weaves this beautiful mosaic together with his fantastic editing job. Piling on the emotion character by character, scene by scene. Tracking shoots and zooms galore fascinate me every time, grabbing my whole attention just because I want to experience it again. The vibrant colour formed a massive impression on me. It's indescribable but must be mentioned. Its so; definitive, in a sense. I'm not entirely sure how its expressed in words. Its sort of; comfort. Like a familiar room where I could just relax. No, I can't express it. Let's just say its personal perfection. Magnolia has some of the most faultless scoring of any film imaginable. From Aimee Mann's own songs to classical music to no music at all (leaving the acting to take hold of the scene ? extremely effective and affective). It keeps a solid pace to the film. Making it one of the shortest 3 hour films I've ever sat through. Before now, I would have never been able to sum what Magnolia is about in a sentence. Maybe I would have said; "It's about the life of these certain connected people in a day". Now; sentences are too short. Magnolia is about the relationships between parent and child of all ages, sexes and situation, and all the people that surround them. Simple acts of greed come back to haunt them. Repressed emotion is stored. Repressed emotion is wanting to be let out. Repressed emotion is let out in the wrong manner. Repressed emotion is let out at the wrong time and the wrong way. It's released, but not restored. It just destroys them. And in the end, nothing is resolved. The repressed emotion is free. My personal favourite performance of the film belongs to Tom Cruise. His transformation from his energetic and enthusiastic persona to a subtle and brittle true self, once the repressed emotion is released of course. Melora Walters' incredibly anxious performance is my second favourite performance, which I must say I respected it a lot more with this rewatch.I'm not sure whether this is new founded love or not; as Magnolia was previously my number two on my second viewing. I think, now I have gained a greater understanding and respect for the film. I have a better personal connection with the film. And that is that its my biggest inspiration in all of film. I also wouldn't have been able to squeeze a bloody paragraph of why I love Magnolia (too difficult), but for some reason, now I can. I love this film, and nobody can take it away from me. It has been jumping around my list a lot recently, but now I think its staying put. Or, it can only go higher. It now rests at #3. Magnolia goes above and beyond perfection.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Magnolia, and it is a truly magnificent gem of a movie. IMDb lists this as "an epic mosaic of interrelated characters," and that is an accurate description. This is like later films such as Crash and The Air I Breathe, except longer, more detailed, more intricate and more emotional than both of them put together. From the first minute, you're drawn into a well-written whirlpool of words and stunningly realistic characters, and it never lets up. For a full three hours, you will be captivated, jerked from side to side as if on the sinking Titanic as you watch the movie unfold like a blooming magnolia, into a tale of regrets, grudges, and ultimately, redemption. The way everything fits together is just spellbinding, and the film as a whole will hit you harder than a bag of bricks.Magnolia is superlative, and I'm gravely sorry to have deprived myself of it for so long. See this if you like good film-making at all, and that is not hyperbole.</fullReview>

I like the actors and never heard of the film maker so then I had to see it. This film had brilliance every minute of it from start to finish. John C. Reilly gives, Tom Cruise, Philip Baker Hall and Melora Walters deserve Oscars more than any performance I have ever seen. The writing is brilliant in ever way imaginable and for some reason he didn't get the Oscar which deserve. The beginning is just brilliant and the ending is better good but dose not explain what happens to all the story. Most likely they want you to fill in all the blanks but I would like it more if they explain. I highly recommend this film to anyone and I think that everyone will like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What Can We Forgive?" And, How Far Would the Effect Go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia, yes, is about coincidence and happenstance, and the frustrating effects of someone else's intertwining doings upon one's plans. But that is something many filmmakers could do. Magnolia is something much more poignant, and with much more scope. That statement is the format it sets for itself, and within the framework of several intersecting characters whose big and small and complex degrees of separation are slowly unraveled throughout, it ponders forgiveness and the understanding it takes to forgive. So many characters bear grudges, let their repressed hatred grow and shape them from the inside out, and let anger with someone close to them consume them. It takes one character, ironically a very simple-minded one, to ask finally ask the question, "What can we forgive? That the tough part." And the tough part spoken of takes something so rare but so simple, and that is understanding, forgetting about blind judgments and chips on the shoulder. And all throughout the film, Paul Thomas Anderson subtly wraps painful misunderstandings around each other, always understood by the audience but never by surrounding characters. For instance, Jeremy Blackman's game show whiz kid character who doesn't want the pressure of being right all the time, but his selfish, bossy father and the game show adults could never think of that.Anderson lathers on a consistent theme of bad parenting, rooting the troubles and short fuses of major characters in abuse, or neglect, or a pressure-cooker environment, Blackman's character being a beginning stage of what happens to so many other characters in the film, some of them passing by and never realizing what they have in common.Something very clever and interesting that can be accredited to PT Anderson's style, also seen in Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love, is his treatment of characters and their premises. His characters can seem like twisted versions of crude, wry satire. William H. Macy's character, for example, is an ex-game show whiz kid moping in a bar watching Blackman's whiz kid on TV, drinking his sorrows, just fired from his sales job, getting ready to get braces. This is funny, but Anderson gives it such aching sadness and atmospheric loneliness, and Macy plays it with a stagelike melodrama, as if he were a Eugene O'Neill character. Also, Philip Baker Hall's host for a wacky game show where adults play against kids has been hosting TV for years, ever since he was a greasy black-haired young man. Now he is clearly melancholy, the bags under his eyes big enough to hide contraband, and when he staggers to the floor clutching his chest and gasping or breath, the show suddenly goes to the title card. Then after a minute, the show rolls on as if nothing happened. Think about it. That's funny. But when the blanks are filled in for Hall's character, we're not laughing too hard.Anderson is never-endingly creative. If one were to compare him to Scorsese, another powerful contemporary director, you could say that where they both have a gift for recognizing great drama, Scorsese refuses to take any other way but with the utmost realism out of harrowing, beautiful, satirical, dramatic situations whereas Anderson feels the need to uplift it. In Magnolia, a beautiful and brutally honest epic about nothing more than people and their lives, there is a central montage situated from one of the sweet and beautiful Aimee Mann songs included in the film, a song called Wise Up, in which the whole panorama of characters is unwittingly singing in unison with each other. It's the sort of film that could just reach the pinnacle, only a centimeter away with the film otherwise, of ultimate visionary cinematic ambition, an astonishment for a film by a borderline-fanboy director so young and early in his career, with the inclusion of a musical number. This is as close to a musical number you can get with such an honest and personal independent-spirited film like this. And Anderson somehow manages to get there.Tom Cruise, infamously mediocre as an actor, gives his greatest performance ever here, showing that is actually is quite capable of solid, riveting dramatic acting. However, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays his role so subtly, so unobtrusively, and we are so impacted by him. He gathers tears in our eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exquisite Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of those rare films that amazes you more each time you watch it. It does this because it's complexity reveals a new secret every single time. Every line, that may seem weird at first, gain more and more meaning with each watch. It is because of this that I have to say that it has to be my favorite film of all time. It's difficult to summarize Magnolia's story in just a few lines as there are so many interdependent aspects to it, however I can say that there are definite themes throughout the film and the main one of which would have to be regret and coping with it. There is no real weak point to speak of when it comes to the acting as well. Every character is unique and is marvelously portrayed by the ensemble cast. Paul T. Anderson also used a directing style that suited the script brilliantly. His use of song at certain parts in the film to help convey the story was also unique and refreshing. While Magnolia is a 3 hour film, as with most good films, you don't really feel it. In short: this is not your average film. However, I can't stress the fact that you have to watch it at least twice to fully appreciate it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are usually smarter than the average blockbuster?the average movie, in fact?but you are probably not smarter than Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson was not yet thirty years old when he served up the Altmanesque, Oscar-grabbing hyperlink epic that is 'Magnolia' ? a fluently mosaic drama with so many ambitious turns, eerily connective logic and intricate patterns in its plethora of intertwining story lines that the intelligence of the filmmaker behind the spectacle fully floored me. That is not to say the three hours of heavy-handed melodrama passes quickly ? they do not ? but I was entranced in every intelligent second of the film.An ironic, karmic prelude opens 'Magnolia', with narrated diagrams on the way in which a failed suicide becomes accidental manslaughter, a segment which sets the clever intricacy for what is to come once Anderson directs his solemnly beautiful kaleidoscope onto the lives of some 6-7 characters. However, where the ironic prelude set a clever-and-fun tone with warped fates, the rest of Magnolia?all three hours of it?shatters whatever charm built up and instead plunge into melodrama, for good and bad. I certainly won't attempt to recap the dizzyingly time-bending cyclical story-lines in San Fernando Valley or its multitude of complex persons, just rest assured that its lachrymose content entails heaps of terminal diseases, infidelity, frailty, addiction, incest, insecurity and strained relations that will altogether constitute some 95% of Magnolia's overriding theme. Yes, it's weepy, depressing, desperately pulling at the collective heartstrings of humanity, but in terms of tragedy there is a little something for everyone which makes it reliable and effective in eliciting a psychological response.All throughout the film and especially as it neared an end, I realised what I really wanted was buckets more of each storyline. This should probably be attributed to the film's earth-shatteringly powerful ensemble cast. Each inhabit a leading role in their own storyline, which naturally gives extra weight to the entirety of the film. "The performers are a lot more believable than their characters," ? Hoberman of the village voice remarks, and I'm inclined to agree. The writing is misty but layered and even unnecessarily complex at times as the viewer is left to hungrily unfold each character because they are so rich and mysterious. Thankfully, to centre these characters and support them is a wide array of dutiful Anderson casting choices: William H Macy gets his loser on, Julianne Moore plays a fragile, neurotic woman with superb emotional transparency, Tom Cruise is hilarious as the despicably male-chauvinist guru who is forced to reconnect with his father on his deathbed and lastly, John C. Reilly is assigned a formidably beautiful lovestory. Yet the casting goldmine is truly Philip Seymour Hoffman as the caring nurse...As for cinematography, which I feel unreasonably compelled to bring up, the screen is awash with with Scorsese-styled tracking shots, long Anderson takes and steadicams, all of which project a fluent and seamless image. Aside from the aforementioned camera devices, there is no fancy windowdressing or pleasurable paintjob on the other side of the tapestry; it's all out in the open and Anderson bravely plunges into drama with camera-movement as the only weapon in his arsenal. For long I thought 'mosaic' should be reserved for cell surface membranes but having seen Magnolia the adjective is perfectly earned as the superstructure ? the dialogue, the shots, the symmetry, the characters, the intertwining bonds ? blend in much like neatly-patterned mosaics. But 'Magnolia' is not devoid of faults. Although perhaps no discernible flaws are present, a couple of contrived scenes do bubble up under the otherwise smoothly-embroidered lit. The forced song-number of some Heather Nova song in which the film cuts to all characters singing to the lyrics on a rainy night channels a cheesy episode of Friends. On that note, the overly-ambitious, Oscar-baiting musical score is often far too grandiose for the subtlety of the scenes to which it is scored. Magnolia is also reek with symbolism and although that is certainly no shortcoming on its own, there are a few too many sentimental biblical references to weed through for my taste. The scene of raining frogs alludes to some biblical event but pushes the boundaries of artistic license on the director's part. Lastly, at 3h 8 minutes it is inexcusably long, perhaps much owing to lengthy rambling on the characters' part (especially C. Reilly and Robards), which in many ways further heightens the gritty realism of the film since it truly is how people talk in real life. Nevertheless, it occasionally drags because of it.Paul Thomas Anderson touches all perceptible bases in 'Magnolia', transcending metaphysics, logic and relationships ? but to excellent, heartfelt effect, much thanks to his brave and emotive cast. It is probably not a film I would want to sit through again ? if only for the time-consuming factor ? but it is evident that you are in the hands of a master director here, so sit back and enjoy the experience and absorb the pleasurably solemn atmosphere.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gut-wrenching scene after gut-wrenching scene litter this film thanks to a large collection of well-rounded characters who are either seeking redemption or searching for past or future glories. Paul Thomas Anderson has created something truly special here, not least because he chose to use brilliant songs by Aimee Mann and an excellent score by her collaborator Jon Brion, but mainly thanks to his extra-ordinary eye for the visual in a dramatic scene and a perfect script beautifully performed by a stellar cast. The running time for this film is generous given its genre, but in this particular case it only serves to heighten the power of its conclusion and the pace never really lets up, which makes viewing it very emotionally draining. The camera is almost always moving too which makes many of the scenes seem like a montage and this is how the film ingeniously reveals the links between the characters. This is sublime film-making and demands multiple viewings despite its length. So much more than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a very big PT Anderson fan and this is for sure the movie why. Character studies and intertwining lives are absolutely wonderful in this movie. I know there are critics that seem to think the LA lives intersecting with lives has gone stale and trivial with movies lately, and maybe true. But I think this was the one that started them all. Julianne Moore and Phillip Baker Hall give great performances in this film, as well of all the other cast. But, as much as I don't really care for the typical movies he acts in, Tom Cruise really gives one of the most true and real performances of his life. Not many movies can hit the heart of the way people really act and react with each other as they do in this movie. If you enjoy Dramas that are real with some slight hope of how we all would like to be and at the same time wish we were not, this is THE ONE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a cinematic connoisseur and post cine analysis geek, "Magnolia" would be the right choice for you. The film has a major star cast, including Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and William H. Macy, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson."Magnolia" is a movie with 6 stories running parallel in a day. As expected, all the stories have some commonality. It is not the normal climax where all the stories converge, but something different and thoughtful. Throughout the movie, the pace is consistent. More of realism and high cinematic class is evident in each and every frame of the movie.Since there are 6 stories, the movie runs for more than 3 hours which may raise eye brows for the normal Hollywood Movie seekers, but believe me it's worth it. The movie takes itself the viewers in and they will be eagerly waiting where it all will summate. The climax will initially disappoint most of the people but I would suggest the viewer to research on the ending and you will realize the blend of realistic and cinematic elegance and excellence."Magnolia" is an emotional drama which talks about lot of issues running in the society and with individuals. Be it domestic disturbance or adultery, it deals everything with sheer brutalism and hits you in the head. The quiz whiz kid whose emotions are shattered and unrecognized, the wife who seeks redemption for her adultery, a daughter puzzled with her distorted past, every character addresses a different set of situations still correlating and criticizing itself to the basic conscience and values.I would say Tom Cruise's best performance throughout his career will not be matched to the eclectic display of acting in this movie. Julianne Moore is as good as Tom. There are lot other performances which will remain in your heart but how could I not tell the character of the police officer. One of the most principle oriented and shy characters that will be placed in your heart forever.Editing needs to appreciated in a great deal for its technical excellence. Handling 6 stories and collaging it in a beautiful and elegant way would not have been a cake walk. All the technical aspects of the movie stands apart, take it the music or the dialogues, Magnolia rips of the society's ill fated discrepancies towards everyone's life.Of all, "Magnolia" will be an entertainer, practical and provide you redemption, if you have the patience to research about it to enlighten yourself.</fullReview>

No car chases, no Bruce Willis leaping off a skyscraper (hey - I enjoy those types of movies too, but if that's all you like, you'll hate this one). I had to keep pausing it and walking away for a few minutes, it was intense. It made me take a few deep breathes, try to process, and proceed. Great cast. I previously hated Tom Cruise in anything I saw him in. As unlikable a character as he plays here, it was the first time I saw him display some real depth with his acting. I actually was impressed with his performance. And great songs - I bought the Aimee Mann soundtrack CD with the lyrics included - it's a killer. Kudos to director Anderson for writing the movie from her songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia, 7/10, 26th best of 1999, 127th in the 1990s, 364th all timeThe primary obstacle for this movie to overcome was the fact that it was over three hours long. That's a very long time to spend watching a movie, especially one with no explosions (I'm kidding {sor of}). But anyway the movie is actually very good. Great characters played by great actors. Interesting interweving stories. (I'm going to talk about something that might not make sense if you've never seen the movie, but won't really give anything important away, read if you care to) Form what I read a lot of people hated the bit with the frogs, but I really liked it. The plot of the movie, and especially the movies music, really created the feeling that it was building towards something big for about an hour and a half leading up to the frog scene. And you feel like there has to be all these separate climaxes where one thing happens to this person, and something else happens to another person, and all these separate amazing climaxes that some how bring everything together. But that didn't have to happen because of the frogs. These people were connected by the fact that they were all in these intense situations that were strangely and seemingly always positively affected by the fact that it somehow started raining frogs. Maybe I'm off the mark but I took it to mean that God had somehow found a way to help all these struggling people with one seemingly random and bizarre act.Thus, this is one of those movies that is left in a precarious position. I thought there was a ton of great stuff here and I liked it a lot. But for a good chunk of the movie I was pretty bored and kind of wanted it to be over. Thus it ends up with a seven. The sad thing is, there was so much going on that I kind of want to see it again, but don't really want to sit through it again. Really quite the sticky wicket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. That's all I have to say. This was my first Paul Thomas Anderson film. I must admit, I've never seen Boogie Nights, but I had heard that he was a phenomenal director, so when this came to theatres, I checked it out. I was not disappointed! This was one of the most amazing films that I had ever seen. The performances were great, and it was well-written and very powerful. I had never seen anything so powerful. This film portrays the human condition like no other film that I have ever seen. All I can say is, if you have not seen this, you need to run to your local video store and rent it. I bought the DVD a few years ago. The DVD has many extra features which are very interesting.By the way, if you like the film, you should also buy the soundtrack. All of the songs in the film are Aimee Mann songs. The film is basically an adaptation of those songs, so the soundtrack goes right along with the film. It's great! The score album by Jon Brion is great, too! I highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is as good as everyone says it is in my opinion, as it's a masterpiece, it's extremely engrossing, and the performances are stunning!. All the characters are absolutely brilliant, and the stories for all the characters blew me away, plus Tom Cruise,John C. Reilly,Julianne Moore,William H. Macy,Philip Baker Hall and Philip Seymour Hoffman are all simply incredible in this!. I thought the opening was pretty cool if a little disturbing, and the score was just plain awesome, plus it's extremely well written and made as well. The ending while quite strange was very well done, with all the frogs coming out of the sky, and in my opinion all of the main characters deserved Oscar nominations, plus even at 180 minutes long, it was never over long for me!. The scene with John C. Reilly and the kid rapping was hilarious for me, and some scenes were so emotional, especially near the end with Cruise and his father Jason Robards!, plus it was completely unpredictable throughout for me!.Even though the characters did some awful things you still can't help but feel for all of them, and my favorite performance has to be a tie between Cruise's and Julianne Moore's, plus it has some very shocking moments as well. It's very depressing but in a good way, and it will really leave you thinking after you are finished watching it, plus it has some very good humorous scenes as well. There is not one dull moment, and while I loved it may not be for everybody, plus I can see why this was on so many top 10 lists in 1999 when it came out. I loved the brilliant dialog, and I believe it's an important viewing for all movie buff's, plus The directing by Paul Thomas Anderson is really incredible, possibly one of the best directing jobs I have ever seen!. The Frog ending is far fetched, but it had an important message in it "It's just something that happens". This is as good as everyone says it is in my opinion, as it's a masterpiece, it's extremely engrossing, and the performances are stunning!, and if you haven't seen it, do so immediately, every movie buff must see at least once!.The Direction is really amazing!. Paul Thomas Anderson does an amazing job here with incredible camera work, incredible angles, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, while he didn't have a whole lot of screen time, he was an important part of the film, and gave one powerful performance, and it was a different character for him, that he pulled off perfectly, the scene where he breaks down in front of his father in the hospital really got to me, he was brilliant!. John C. Reilly is incredible here as well, as the vulnerable Cop, he was extremely likable, and I really felt for him, he was just an ordinary every day cop, he was just great!. Julianne Moore is amazing as always and is incredible here, she played a wreck literally, it was a tough role, but she nailed it perfectly, I really felt sorry for her, this is one of her best performances, if not her best! . Philip Baker Hall is also incredible here as Jimmy Gator, you know what he has done is wrong, yet still can't help but feel bad for him, this guy deserves a lot more recognition!. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a small but extremely important role here, he was really likable, and I felt for him too. Jason Robards is incredible as the dying man, I felt extremely bad for him, for what he was going through, and the pain he must have been in, as it made me suffer just looking at him. William H. Macy is incredible as the quiz kid, who I also really felt sorry for, the scene where he got drunk was really powerful. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do, it's an important viewing for all movie buff's at least once!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

I read something that hit me for some reason pretty hard, something that PT Anderson once said, that "For better or worse" he doesn't know, or rather he doesn't believe, that he'll "ever make a movie as good as Magnolia. It is and will continue to be the best film he ever makes." ??????. "And the book says: 'We may be through with the past. But the past 'aint through with us."

		<fullReview>Another well crafted film from PTA. It's amazing to watch a director connect so many scenes with so many characters into one piece. Unlike many Altman films, these stories all tie in together and every character is trying to get somewhere. The scene with Jason Robards describing his reflection of how long life is while showing other characters at their lowest points should make viewers rewind and pay attention to how you may feel about your actions down the line. I have never seen a song used in a film like this until Aimee Mann's Wise Up began. Notice how Jason Robards life feels unfinished, but Jim Curren (hhmmm, initials J.C. Coiencidence) has another take on the world. A brisk three hour film with never a dull moment. An absolute masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long but Enthralling in a Very Intense, Personal Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was the only one in the full audience of senior citizens who loved "Magnolia." Every one else was sighing, snoring, talking back to the screen, complaining to their companion, loudly eating and quite quickly ran to the bathroom as soon as it was over (well, 3 hours is long).I was enthralled for virtually every minute (all right, there were a few draggy scenes at the over 2 1/2 point and why do some points have to be made with two characters going through similar catharses?).Tom Cruise was mesmerizing, quite different from his usual persona, but the whole ensemble was excellent. Each of these actors has been in other movies this year but these are their best roles. The writing, editing, visual look were very personal.Not only are the terrific Aimee Mann songs used as a Greek chorus and intimately with the characters but the score propulsively carries the action forward, helping create suspense and linkages between scenes, frequently covering over the dialog as you see that the words don't really matter sometimes. (Director Paul Thomas Anderson's girlfriend Fiona Apple is thanked at least four times in the credits and seems to have had something to do with the musical score. I hope he also gave her something to eat.)I thought the Urban Legend introduction was over the top until the apocalyptic ending put it in context. I particularly liked that the characters went through something and they all learn something about themselves and change because of it -- which I was taught in school is the essence of drama but so few movies do that these days.(1/16/2000)</fullReview>

Thanks to this restart everything fell into place.

I think its characters are so well developed and the story is just so powerful that you can't help but become addicted.

		<shortDescription>Brechtian Elements in Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film. Upon first viewing, I became hooked from the opening fate sequences. I went into the film, not really interested in it, nor wanting to see it. But after it started I couldn't get away from it. After learning some theory I realized that Anderson, whether consciously or not, utilized many of Bertolt Brecht's ideas for the film. One of his theories is called the Verfremdungs Effekt (badly translated to mean Alienation Effect) which meant to disengage the audience from the production, causing them to question the choices of the characters, and hopefully carrying those questions into their own lives after the movie is finished. Examples of the Alienation Effect: when Claudia yells at her father, Frank MacKey's seminars, the raining frogs, and the use of camera (long takes with long shots). Titles were used, a narrator (not only the voice over at the beginning and the end), but the young boy, 'prophet', who reveals some details about the relationships in the film. The fact that there are more questions than answer, that the audience is left to question not only their existence, but also power of fate. All of these lend themselves to Brechtian theories. Upon viewing the film with this insight, one can truly appreciate the work that went into it, and could, dare I say, consider it a masterpiece.I could easily go on and on about the acting, and cinematography, both of which are utterly amazing, and work to further define and develop the story and themes, but that would cause for a long unoriginal comment, of which you would probably not want to read. So I'll leave you with this: if you have not seen the movie, put it on your list to see/rent/buy. It's great, but give it a chance.

		<fullReview>Magnolia, with a running time of +3 hours may be tough for some viewers to watch. But excellent acting of the ensemble cast kept me glued to the screen and made it seem a hour shorter than it really was. Often an under-appreciated movie, magnolia is for true film fans and touches you emotionally in almost every aspect. The ending was quite surprising and took some time to think about, and for some odd reason, seemed a perfect ending to an almost perfect film. The entire cast was excellent as I stated before, but standouts include John C Rielly, Melora Walters,and Tom Cruise. Magnolia was truly one of the best, if not the best of 1999.

		<fullReview>Ever since i was a kid, i've wanted to make movies. Spielberg put me in awe with Jaws and Jurassic Park, and ignited my passion for film. As time went on, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs cemented the idea of making movies in the future. But its Magnolia, a work of absolute brilliance, that inspires me to live my dream. P.T. Anderson is able to create such a masterful, creative, and moving experience like nothing i have ever seen. He builds the characters and has the audience not only seen their pain and anguish, but feel it. This is a movie about loneliness, love, and the human emotions that ruin and save people. Anderson not only gets that across, but he does it will style and grace. His camera work with long, long shots, impressive tracking shots, and amazing closeups just give the movie a whole life of its own.I wish i can articulate my love for this movie better or more, but i just can't. This movie is without my favorite movie for numerous reasons, and i just wish that i could go to the theaters and experience more things like this movie...unfortunately i don't think that will be happening anytime soon. This movie gets **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much to say about this movie other than to avoid it at all costs. When you see high profile names such as Tom Cruise and Jason Robards, you expect to see a decent movie. However, "Magnolia" was such a huge disappointment that it doesn't give viewers much faith. I'm embarrassed to say that I've seen "Magnolia."To its credit, "Magnolia" had a few bright spots including the performances of everyone from John C. Reilly to William H. Macy. These performances were trampled by the number of storylines this movie has.The biggest negative in "Magnolia" was the multitude and number of confusing storylines. This will cause the audience to just not care anymore about the rest of the movie. I can tell you that this is exactly what happened with me. I think it would have been much better if it had fewer storylines."Magnolia" is the type of movie that would turn anyone off to the actors and director of the film from watching anything they star or direct in again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think it's any accident that Henry Gibson has a small role in Magnolia - the connection to Robert Altman's sprawling, fragmented films like Nashville and Short Cuts is unmistakable... Anderson has devised a film with nine different story strands - too many to fully cover here - but in one of them Jason Robards Jr. lies dying of cancer, tended by hired nurse Philip (Seymour Hoffman) while his much younger second wife Julianne Moore races around town trying to find answers and drugs... we don't know Robards' connection with Tom Cruise's character - a born again crusader for the rights of men whose motto is seduce and destroy - then there's a former game show whiz kid, William H Macy, now a sorry ineffectual salesman who's sure a new set of teeth will solve his loneliness... and the gameshow host, Phillip Baker Hall, who's desperate to re-establish relations with his estranged daughter Melora Walters who's got a major drug problem and who's the object of affection of a cop John C. Reilly... Magnolia's about the lives we live, the damage we do...At a running time of over three hours Magnolia is a fairly long film... if only... because the ingredients are the stuff of great filmmaking... with a completely surreal and daring climax... With an array of simply wonderful performances - there isn't a weak one in the lot and Cruise and Robards are simply splendid - Magnolia is an electrically harrowing saga that's full of compassion... Aimee Mann's music and Robert Elswit's cinematography contribute majorly.I loved this film from start to finish: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia isn't worth my time to critique in depth; over long, meaningless; pretentious, psuedo-intellectual drivel. Check out my review of Boogie Nights if you're interested in knowing the sort of scathing remarks I would use for this film if I felt it was worth it. The trouble is, those who can recognise a bad film when they see one, don't need me to deconstruct this for them to explain its faults, and those who think it is good filmmaking are obviously way beyond rational help. As for the unintentionally funny parts; example: Man dying of cancer, lying on his deathbed, begging for someone to bring his estranged son to him, tubes up nose, etc. suddenly gets up and starts singing?! Weh-hey! It's a musical! [Master of his craft this Mr. Anderson, hell yes! Never was there a man with his fingers playing more skillfully over the heartstrings of his audience!] Do yourself a favour and do not watch this film. I repeat - DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. Better yet, do what I am going to do and never waste any more of your time - or money - on a Paul Thomas Anderson film again. Boycott the man's work. I'm serious. N.B. There are three on my list list now: Roland Emerich (causes: Independence Day, Godzilla), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (cause: Alien Resurrection), Paul Thomas Anderson (causes: Boogie Nights, Magnolia).</fullReview>

The rest is pure bore, except for the frogs. I still don't understand what they mean, but it's a good variation when you are thinking about shutting down before the end! Soundtrack is often used to annoy, when it's too loud to let you understand what people says. There's also a bit of "musical" when all characters sing together the titletrack. Awful! Tom Cruise's character is the best thing in this movie, before it becomes sad (at about half the way). It's lessons and interviews are wonderful, if you have some sense of humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a fan of the over rated "Boogie Nights" I was uncertain before watching "Magnolia".Considering I am also no fan of Tom Cruise and the fact the movie is nearly three hours long,i was not exactly looking forward to this film.But I watched it anyhow and I am glad I did.The length of the movie does not matter in the end as each scene,all set in the one day,is snappy to the point.The pace of the movie is also carried along by a totally gripping musical score and one of the finest cast lists you can find in any movie today.Cruise totally goes over the top in his role as a chauvinist pig and the rest of the cast thrive on this as the other characters are 100% believable.My pick of the bunch would have to be John C.Reilly as the lonely cop who falls in love.He plays a character who I feel we can all feel sympathy for over the course of the movie.In the end Magnolia is a deep and moving film that is more than a tale about chance like we are first led to believe that it is.It is the most emotional movie i have seen in along time and could change the way movies of this kind are made.It is long but has to be seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that everyone I talk to about this Magnolia seems to have this "wo! It was too deep, tried to do too much, made by who?" attitude towards this film. Then there are the people who actually like it. I am one of those people. I admit, the film does drag at points but with good reason. Maybe Anderson didn't intend for the film to be this way, but I feel that it drags so that it can bring out emotion from the viewer. There are scenes in the film that don't make sense, that are very unreal, but amazing in their own way. If you can't see that, then maybe you're for the better. It must mean that you can't identify with the oddities of the film because your experiences have not led you there. I don't know if my experiences have enabled me to identify with this film. I might just have a good eye for this stuff. The bottom line is that, for those that can understand the thread of the film-that central element that makes Magnolia such a great cinematic body, the film is incredible. For everyone else it's boring. Watch it, and see if you've got that eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with all comments thus far that Magnolia is definitely one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.But rather than go into story details, I felt it is worth mentioning the overall idea behind the piece.In the case of every character represented in the film, we see how they are constantly forced to deal with actions of their past. There is very much a cause and effect idea going throughout the film.However, the opening scene, Donny's lightning incident, the meeting of Claudia and Jim, and of course the final climatic frog scene, plays in with the author's theory that sometimes things just happen. In a film which reinforces the importance of the past, the final ironic twist is that sometimes things just happen, with drastic effects, which we didn't ask for and cannot prevent."...and no, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched this film i knew that it would be the type of film that would polarise all those who saw it, there would be many who would love it and many who would not. That is easy to justify when you see how many comments that exist for this film, and yet the score that this film has and it's place in the top #100 would appear to say that many more people who liked it were bothered to place a vote.There are many criticisms in earlier comments, in my opinion some more justified than others but a few I really can't let go past without saying more about them. First up, and most fundamental i think is the criticisms that this is a film that doesnt say anything, that it lacks a narrative structure. That people just didn't get the start and that the film seemed to take so long to say so little (or in the words of some, to take 3 hours to tell us the obvious). But i have problems with this criticism, this is not a film that is a simple story teller, it is a film that deals with more a fundamental issue than a beginning, a middle and then an end. The vast majority of Shakespeare's plays all follow the same narrative structure, introduce the situation and characters, then allow destructive change to happen and then resolve the drama in an entertaining and hopefully illuminating manner. But this film is not like that...For a start it is set in one day, it is a day in the life of people, of ordinary people. People like me who write how I feel about this film, and people like you who will read it. And in each of the days that tick by us they have a beginning (we wake up) and an end (guess what, we go to bed again) but everything else, everything else is middle. And that is what this film is. It does not tell a story as much as let as look at peoples lives for a brief moment in time. That is it's structure. It makes demands of you as a watcher, you can't just switch on and off as and when you please. You must work, you must concentrate. If you do not then the film will pass you by.The second big criticism is that of the amount of swearing and this I find vaguely mystifying. This is an adult film, made by adults for an adult audience. And this is how people talk, this is how I talk. You may not swear and that's fair enough, that is your choice. But if you don't like it, then go and watch Disney films in which they are so busy trying not to offend anyone that no-one is satisfied by the brain-rotting, anaemic, mass-produced, sterilised 'products' that they issue. I find it strange that in the year 2001 mainly Americans will complain about swearing in films and yet find it easy to ignore the fact that they live in a society that is awash with so much worse...But as to the film itself. I started another comment on a film in IMDB with a famous F.Scott Fitzgerald quote that 'Character IS action'. And this is what this film gives the watcher. The chance to participate and watch in the great game of life. To see how much of life is chance and how amazing are the co-incidences that go to make life as it is. The fact that how we look at life as we see it today is filtered by everything that has gone yesterday. The fact that we all want someone to love, and someone to love us. To connect to another. To feel, to be. To compare films is useless. Orwell said that to compare works of art to each other was as pointless as to compare an apple to an orange. Orwell also said that to attempt to define works of art as being good is also useless. Art can be judged by only one thing. Survival. If a work of art exists out of the time in which it was created than it does so for one reason and one reason only, because it is able to say something to us without knowing of us. I agree with many of the people here when they say that the big films of 1999 will come and go, and Magnolia will remain. It deals with what it is to be human, and for good or ill that very rarely changes. If you want explosions or a 90 minute package then look elsewhere. If you want to put in effort and hopefully to be rewarded with a film that long after you have seen it is still with you then give Magnolia the effort that it deserves. Is 3 hours really such a price to pay for the smile at the end of it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I stepped into the theater to see this film, my favorite movie of all time was the Orson Welles classic, THE THIRD MAN. About half way through MAGNOLIA, I knew that that was going to change. What a brave film this is. In a time when big studios only want to release films that are an hour and forty-five minutes and dumbed down to the point where a two year old could understand them, Anderson had the guts to make a three and a quarter hour, sweeping, mosiac of a film, filled with substance, characters we care about, even though it may be hard to care about them, and theology that will make even the brightest scholars think deeply. The thing that makes Anderson's films so wonderful is the fact the he truly cares about every character he writes, and makes sure we care about them too. After SYDNEY and BOOGIE NIGHTS, it was safe to say that Anderson was a talented auteur. After MAGNOLIA, I have no problem saying that he is the most talented writer, director, living today. Lets just hope that this upcoming Adam Sandler project doesn't ruin him. Thank you Mr. Anderson for not making me feel like two year old. Oh yeah, Am I the only person that thinks its a little strange that the voter rating for this film is 8.2. This cannot be just one of those things.</fullReview>

Movies like Magnolia twist together story lines to hide the fact that individually they're so incredibly boring.I spent the first half of this movie wondering who among the news-conscious public wasn't already aware of these three famous stories, and the second half wondering why in the name of all that is Holy the producers of any show involving kids would be aired live in this day and age. And don't get me started on the frogs.I'm of the opinion that in a lot of TV series, actors are unfairly credited for brilliant dialogue they merely had the good fortune of reading the lines. (Also with movies, like Something About Mary). Well, the acting profession returns the favor here. All the actors, big name or no, deserve the credit they get for their performances here. But nevertheless, I would not recommend this movie to *anyone*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about hope, redemption, love, loss, and frogs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film in the spirit of Robert Altman's Nashville and Short Cuts. This is Writer/Director PT Anderson's third film and the best yet. (He also wrote/directed Hard Eight (Sydney), and Boogie Nights). This movie centers around coincidence, redemption, and how "you can be through with the past, but the past is not through with you". It takes place in the San Fernando Valley and spans 24 hours in the lives of many people. Some of whom are paralleling each other. Like Quiz Kid Donny Smith who is a parallel to a young child who is now on quiz shows. Tom Cruise gives an exceptional performance as Trevor Mackey, a sex tape guru who was abondened by his father when his mother was dying of cancer. His father is now the one dying of this disease (The late great Jason Robards). He is married to Julianne Moore who married him for the money and now feels guilty about finally falling in love with the old man, just as he's dying. The nurse taking care of him Phil Parma is played by Phillip Seymour-Hoffman in another wonderful performance. The host of the quiz show Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker-Hall) is also dying of cancer. And did something to his daughter Claudia that has led her to a life of cocaine abuse and random sex. All of these characters undergo major changes over this period of time as we are led from a deathbed scene, to an interview gone bad, to a murder, through the lives of these pathetic but likeable characters. PT Anderson is the master of swirling camera's and has a visual style all his own. This film was the best film of 1999 and is my personal favorite film ever. It did not make the kind of money it should have but has been discovered on video obviously as it ranks #77 all time currently on the imdb top 250 list. The surprise ending seems insaine at first but makes complete sense when you think about it. Most people might not get the film because it is so original, a matter of fact after 2 of it's three hours were done in the movie theater some people were already walking out. But i say and go see it, "It's the damndest thing you ever saw".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of last year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it was the best film made on 1999. All the plot structure, the characters involved in the story, and of course, the best thing Tom Cruise has ever done. Otherwise, the Soundtrack is excellent. When I just saw the film I ran to a CD's shop to buy it. It is wonderful, and perfectly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the boy cried out "he's got no clothes on..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but for all the pretentious garblings and extensive vocabulary used by the acclaimers of this film, i just cannot begin to accept that Magnolia is a decent movie. It seems that an "Emperors clothes" scenario seems to be occuring, where critics spout its appraisal from the roof tops and the sheep below feel obliged to agree with the witterings. Magnolia is brilliant and gripping in its first 10 minutes where it details the true life coincidences and the you are left thinking "wow, what must this film in its length come up with in it's bringing together of characters?". You sit and wait, and you carry on waiting for the climax to come in a stupendous coming together of sub-plots but very sadly it never comes. And when the idea of raining not the proverbial cats and dogs but frogs hits you, anyone with an ounce of decency thinks to themselves "What???!!!". For the filmmakers to fob us all off with the line "You wouldn't believe it if it happened in a movie" just seems to bolster my opinion that this film says "look, it's a brilliant tale of people linked in an intricate way, it's great isn't it?!". No, this is the boy who says no sir, this is a film that likes to think it is dressed up in see through critical garb and then thinks that no one can see through it. Sorry, but there are lots who can, just don't be afraid to say it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me state what I liked about the movie - Tom Cruise. This was some of his best work and he deserved the Oscar for it. Now as for the rest of the movie, at first it was difficult to get into this style of film - it is different, although different is not always good as some people might think. The various story lines without many tie ins is somewhat unique, although I can think of a few movies that have done this before Magnolia. I was able to feel somewhat comfortable watching this movie towards the end, that is until the last moments of the film. I won't say what the ending is, but as a rational, logical human being this ending offends me. I cannot accept things just because they occur, as I find most people will agree with me. That is what makes this awkward film finally turn into a ridiculous and horrible movie. If you can't accept things without a rational explanation, then you will probably hate this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson's Magnolia keeps in the tradition of films that can't or can be explained. We see a 3 hour journey in the San Fernando valley with interlocking stories that are linked by fate, coincidence and blood. The stars of these stories include Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, Melora Waters, Melinda Dillon, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Phillip Baker Hall, John C. Reiley, Alfred Molina, Ricky Jay, Jeremy Blackman and William H. Macy. Not everything in the film is odd, just the ending with the frogs (if I can have that explained I will really like this movie). Yet, many things in this film I did like, and it is memorable in Anderson's tradition from Boogie Nights. One of the best films of the year. Look for Luis Guzman as a contestant on a game show.

		<shortDescription>Far from depressing, "Magnolia" actually reveals profound Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been ambivalent about seeing "Magnolia." All the critics' talk about its long running time, "disjointedness" and such had me imagine the movie to be one of those pretentious and artsy-fartsy film school indulgences that are far removed from the life I lead and the world I inhabit. Even the movie's makers called it "depressing" in a recent Entertainment Weekly interview.But to borrow Gomer Pyle's favorite expression-- "Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!"This movie was long (200 minutes), but very lively. And while "Magnolia" certainly portrays some less than wonderful behaviors and circumstances-- something about it seemed upbeat. Go figure.Really-- it was somehow kind hearted, and even vaguely uplifting. "Magnolia" is kind of an answer to nihilism-- kind of an "anti" French or German movie. That is, one could say the movie displays us at our worst, and then oddly lets us know that at the same time, our lives are also bigger than our plans, bigger than our personalities, for sure bigger than our conscious mind's ability to manage the universe. Kind of like the forest area surrounding Mt. St. Helen's volcano in Washington state back in 1980. Right after the worst of the volcanic eruptions, the news choppers were showing miles and miles of utter desolation. U.S. President Jimmy Carter even said it was completely dead and forlorn, like a "moonscape." Environmentalists were saying that the volcano had damaged the area so badly that nothing would grow for decades, maybe centuries. The experts all declared the vast, devastated forest to be dead. Well-- they were all wrong, of course. Nature came back with Her steady, amazing, magical, confounding, unpredictable majesty and brought the forest back to life the very next year, and the growth has been steady and wild and truly good every year since that time."Magnolia" sort of shows humans to be like that-- we may screw things up-- A LOT -- but always, in the quiet spaces and chinks between our thoughts and grand schemes, Mother Nature is breathing life and Grace back into our lives. Great flick! I gave "Magnolia" a "10."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The triumph of the AAA-souls of post-modernity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when making films that were going against all possible rules in the profession was a dear pastime of some film makers. This film is one of these. Everything is upside down.First an irritating musical sound tracks behind and often over the dialogue. The absolutely absurd succession of short sequences of characters that have nothing in common at first sight and even at second sight. Some connections only become clear at the very end of the film. A lot of old people who have been forgotten on burial day though they are more ghostlike than just plain phantoms,, oops! Sorry, sorry senior citizens, all in the process of dying of all kinds of unnameable ailments, mostly cancer if I heard the words properly in the short silences of the music track.All of them are abominable. Particularly the men, but at the same time the women are not better, subservient and only interested in the security they are and have been provided with. Some are vultures even, and openly so. The younger ones are not more presentable. A drug addict, a social climber, and a few others. We are in the deepest pit of a zoo and all the predators were put together down there like twenty spiders in a pot.Among these one cop who is a fool who believes people can repent and even repair their mistakes and that his real function is to forgive them and by forgiving them lead them into reforming. Marvellous, divine, angelic, with a good dose of sugar on top and whip cream ? la mode.But for such an end to be reached you need a miracle and the miracle happens in the middle of the night after everyone has failed, flunked, fled away from their responsibilities, confessed their crimes. The worse oldie is that dying man who bluntly and flatly tells us that he was in love with his wife, his high school crush, sweetheart, but that he cheated on her for twenty-two or twenty-three years just because he wanted her to be a man since she was intelligent and could not be a woman. Closet homosexual who finally abandoned her in the hands of their son who was at the time under age to take care of a dying mother. Absolutely pathetic and that son finally arrives and cries on the bed of his dying father. This time burlesque.And to make that miracle of reformation happen God will send a powerful sign in the middle of the night from the sky and that I won't reveal. But it really is Mark Twain revisited. The taller the tale, the more believable. Though it turns this story into a farce, a grotesque commedia dell arte prank. So what's left at the end? This world is neurotic at least, psychotic in the middle and schizophrenic at most or at best. We don't live in our minds and in our gentility. We live in the surrounding noise of constant elevator music which at times sounds like a tornado in a culvert. We are blended, mashed, pureed by this constant continuous sound track and we start reacting like demented puppets suffering from Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, a condition that causes people to make repeated, nervous tic-like movements and utter innumerable swear words strung up like never-ending necklaces of excrement. This is a serious disease and the film seems to tell us it is the normal condition of everyday life for everybody starting as soon as the person can utter two words and they probably don't say mama or papa any more in Los Angeles, but rather kaka and some onomatopoeia for the backside hole that brings the soul to the fundament of the body, the backside exhaust pipe of the individual, the AAA-soul.But if that is the depth of our lot then God is right to send some severe punishment down onto us to make us recapture some dignity. By the way, you will probably see that Tom Cruise could do better than he does in many of his films. He must have been inspired by this story of AAA-souls lost in the mud of senior-citizenship and midlife crisis.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Magnolia' (1999)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Magnolia' will always be one of my favorite films of all time. I remember when I first saw the film in 1999, I was eleven years old, and even then I was obsessed with it. Not really the first movie you would imagine a young child watching and actually enjoying, I think I enjoyed the true human nature displayed in this film. Sure, it is depressing, bleak, and our characters are all broken and despairing about something, and I can see how some people might not find these types of characters to be likable, but they are pretty real. These characters are real. Sure, there are some that I like less than others, but each one plays a part, and I think the idea was intriguing to me then (and it still is now, thirteen years later) that these people could be so close to one another without even realizing it until they actually crossed paths.There is really too much going on here in 'Magnolia' for any one critic to respond to at one time. Personally, I think the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson even achieved filming this is extraordinary in itself, let alone the fact that he wrote and directed. I think the reason why I love films like 'Magnolia' so much is because there is something new to be experienced every time you watch it. Even the parts that I feel should be boring, dull, or uninteresting, I am just glued to the screen. There are far too many actors to single out very many, but mostly notable for me are Tom Cruise who I am really not the biggest fan of, but absolutely love him here, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and John C. Reilly who does an excellent job in a serious role, solidifying my belief that he is a brilliant actor who will one day be honored with an Oscar award. I wish Orlando Jones's scenes had actually made it to the film, so maybe I need to seek out a DVD copy of this film so I can indulge in the special features.'Magnolia' I guess is really a hit or miss type of film, but take it from me, this is a beautiful mosaic.'Magnolia' is true art.MAGNOLIA -----10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"These things happen every day"No, they don't. These things do not happen every day. Seeing the 2nd greatest film of all-time doesn't happen everyday. It doesn't happen every month. But when it does happen, you will know.My outdated dictionary's definition of ambition is "An eager desire for distinction, preferment, power, or fame." These nine words can be replaced by one: MAGNOLIA. But enough of my ranting and on to the review.A game show. An interview. A date. A trip to the bar. A quest for redemption. A quest for suicide. These stories are all linked together, but they never fully come together. Some characters never meet and shouldn't because it make the film seem too full. (And Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore on the same screen would cause the world to implode.) Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the brilliant director behind Boogie Nights, perfectly crafts this dramatic epic. Dylan Techinor deserved an Oscar for this brilliant editing. Each frame slides to the next with ease. Jon Brion deserved an Oscar for his score. Similar to a Philip Glass work, it feels as if we are approaching something, something that will have the viewer talking about it the next day.Granted that the film is not for everyone. With 3 morality tales, a musical number, a biblical event, and a running time of three hours, it's a film, that tests a viewer's patience. Despite this, Anderson's direction and script are so grand, that even if you don't like the movie, you can recognize any praise and love it receives. It makes you laugh, cry, and just smile at the pure absurdity of life, It has the greatest cast ever put together for a film. Tom Cruise gives the best performance in the film, of his career, and the best supporting performance of the 90s. He completely inhabits this character and a lesser actor wouldn't be able to handle the emotional range of this character. William H. Macy perfectly inhabits the pathetic attitude of the character, John C. Reilly and Philip Seymore Hoffman are the film's moral core. Their characters are the most sympathetic and respectable in the film. Jason Robards makes the most of his screen-time and takes what could've been a throwaway character and makes him real. His chemistry with Hoffman is great. Philip Baker Hall gives a great performance. He fully fleshes out his character and we believe every emotion. Julianne Moore gives an extremely emotional. Her character is mad at the world and she shows it thoroughly. Some call it over-acting, I call it perfect acting. To each his own. Melora Walters gives a very good fidgety performance, but compared to the others, she is the weakest.When I was done watching, I was emotionally spent and satisfied that I had seen one of the greatest films of my life</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PT Anderson's best: a sad, enchanting ensemble piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all started with Sydney, a small, four-character crime drama. Then he made Boogie Nights, a sober, moving ensemble film set in the porn industry. Showing no sign of tiredness, Paul Thomas Anderson followed those two movies with Magnolia, a devastating, poignant magnum opus (in every sense of the word: it's over three hours long) that deservedly won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Festival and stands alongside Fight Club as the darkest, most daring picture of 1999.Having already shown his love for Robert Altman on Boogie Nights (the swimming pool sequence is every bit as great as the M*A*S*H director's finest work), Anderson brings it to extreme levels this time, crafting a movie of epic proportions which aims to prove there are no coincidences in life, that there has to be some kind of connection (Paul Haggis tried to do the same thing with Crash, with slightly lesser results). The film actually begins with a series of urban legends regarding "coincidences", blatantly pointing out there is no way those incidents occurred by chance.Having explained his point of view in the prologue, the director moves on to telling a story that involves a dozen of people, all dysfunctional, longing for love and, most important, linked in one way or another. The center appears to be the dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), owner of a television network. Though he is in bed and constantly watched by his nurse, Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his foul-mouthed resentment for everything surrounding him manages to affect a series of individuals across L.A., reigniting old, bitter conflicts: there's Claudia (Melora Walters), a drug-addicted part-time hooker who embarks on a relationship with police officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) while trying to forget the problems she has with her father, game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall); there's Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), current champion of Gator's show "What Do Kids Know?", who feels there is something missing in his life, all focused on his remarkable intelligence and how his father (Michael Bowen) exploits it for fame and money; there's Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), aka Quiz Kid, former "boy wonder" of the same show, now a lonely homosexual with nothing but regret for every single thing he's ever done; there's Linda (Julianne Moore), Earl's wife, devastated by the conflicting feelings she has for her husband; and there's the old man's son, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise), a misanthropic nihilist who expresses his absolute hatred for the human race (women in the particular) through his controversial TV program "Seduce and Destroy".All these people are connected, be it by family ties, having the same name or doing the same thing. Most of all, though, they are unmistakably linked by an omnipresent sadness: they are miserable, they want to improve their situation, but seem unable to do so. Unlike Boogie Nights, which showed people who thought they were happy and then were saddened by realizing it was all an illusion, Magnolia features characters who are flawed and unhappy right from the start, and this gloomy mood never lifts from the movie, not even after the surreal event that occurs towards the end (it's weird, it's unexpected, yet somehow it makes perfect sense within the film's structure). The protagonists' need for bonding is felt most strongly in what can be considered the best single scene of Anderson's career: all the characters are listening to the radio and all of a sudden they simultaneously start singing the song that is playing in that moment (Aimee Mann's spellbinding "Wise Up"). It is not merely a brilliant plot device, it is also the movie's most beautiful, harrowing moment.Aside from the director's peerless storytelling skills, what lends Magnolia its true magic is the wonderful ensemble cast: everyone, from the ten-year old Blackman to the late Robards (he sadly, and a bit ironically, died in 2000 of the same disease that consumes his character), is flawless, with standout work coming from Moore, Macy and Hall. And that's without mentioning Tom Cruise: ditching his trademark smile and good-guy mannerisms and exposing the darkest sides of his personality without any fear (the scene where he confronts Robards sees him at his most cruel and self-loathing), he delivers the best work of his career thus far, and it's a shame he didn't receive an Oscar for his audacious, shocking performance (who would have expected him to shout "Respect the c*ck! And tame the c*nt!" with such raging conviction?).Some may dismiss this film for being too long. Some may say it is excessively depressing. Both things may be true from a conventional point of view, but how should one judge a film that defies conventional rules? Magnolia is very sad, that's undeniable, but it is also one of the bravest pieces of cinema ever made, with direction, writing and acting that justify all of its exquisite 192 minutes.</fullReview>

TV mogul Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is on his deathbed and his trophy wife (Julianne Moore) is stockpiling tranquilliser prescriptions all over town with alarming determination. Earl's nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is trying desperately to get in touch with Earl's only son, sex-guru Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise), who's about to have his carefully constructed past blown by a TV reporter (April Grace). Whiz kid Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is being goaded by his selfish dad into breaking the record for the game show What Do Kids Know? Meanwhile, Stanley's predecessor, the grown-up quiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) has lost his job and is nursing a severe case of unrequited love. And the host of What Do Kids Know?, the affable Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), like Earl, is dying of cancer, and his attempt to reconcile with his cokehead daughter (Melora Walters) fails miserably. She, meanwhile, is running hot and cold with a cop (John C. Reilly) who would love to date her, if she can sit still for long enough.

		<fullReview>Chance and coincidence. You look through the past and strange events have happened. What looks like a freak incident, can look coincidental, it just happened. In our opening sequence, in three different events, three stories holds facts of coincidence, though by chance their outcome all could have been different, but that's how things go, they just happen. Nine fractured lives are hitting a critical point, the seams are tearing and their lives are spinning out of control. Dying of cancer, Earl Partridge, on his death bed, is cared by hospice worker Phil Parma. Earl's second wife Linda is mentally unraveling, seeking drugs to subsides her husbands pain; and her own. Earl last wish is to see his lost son, Frank T.J. Mackey, giving seminars to men on how to seduce and swoon women through lies and deceit. Donnie Smith use to be a famous quiz kid on the show 'What do Kids Know?'. Penny less, Donnie sells his former fame for attention and his work at an electronics store. Stanley Spector is the current brain child on the show, growing tired of his father vicariously living through him. Host of the game show, Jimmy Gator has recently diagnosed with cancer, with two months left to live. Jimmy tries to amends his relationship with his daughter Claudia, addicted to heroin and sex with strangers. Lost with love and unappreciated at work, Officer Jim Kurring becomes infatuated with Claudia.With multiple story lines, its hard to grasp to overall size. While these people are strangers to many, during one day, their lives intersect with others. During this one day, they question their lives, the lies and deception they hold, the forgiveness of their loved one, meaning to their lives, and the happiness they all sorely and blindly seek. Coincidence and chance are strange facets of life. As these people encounter one another, are these meetings by chance, or this there a benevolent force at work; is it fate that their lives crossed with another. Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't lean towards either explanation, many of the events procured do happen by chance alone, while others are forced by fate.While these incidents of chance and fate hide their answers, one variable stays constant; it happened. Things happen and there is no way around it. In a twist of fate, connecting all these fractured lives, what seems like an inexplainable and unfathomable event, in one of the most unforgettable and ethereal endings in film.Boosting a stellar cast, Magnolia holds a amazing cast, equally matched by their brilliant performances. Many films that have huge cast with top actors, usually collapse under the weight, relying heavily on the actors to cover the weakness of the script. Paul Thomas Anderson's script has such a strong foundation, with the actors perfectly casted to their roles, the story flourished instead of falling behind the presence of the celebrities.Tom Cruise brings his most brilliant performance of his career. John C. Reilly has always given strong constant performances, here being no different. Julianne Moore does a great job, though its saddening to seeing only one type of emotion from her the entire film. William H. Macy also shines, though he character doesn't receive much screen time. Philip Seymour Hoffman grows stronger with every performance he does. Jason Robards doesn't give much, though its hard when your character is bed ridden. Philip Baker Hall and Melora Walters really show the tension between their characters. Jeremy Blackman wonderfully shows the pressure children hold from the overbearing parents.Perfectly balancing the story between all the characters, Magnolia is a brilliant film on the journey of redemption, one of the most amazing films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the point is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic example of the assumption that because something is bleak and depressing, it must be invested with some sort of deeper message. Magnolia has nothing to say beyond the blindingly obvious, namely if you treat people badly, you may well come to regret it. It isn't entirely bereft of ideas: Tom Cruise's character I found interesting, for example, as well as the scene between the drug addict and the policeman. However, even fairly most mediocre, non-critically-hyped films have the odd interesting aspect to them, but Magnolia seems to think its slender number warrant a three hour film. You actually feel as if you are being punished as you watch it, such are the depths of its overwrought tedium. Its attempts to link the (misleadingly promising) opening sequence concerning the nature of coincidences to the final connection of the storylines is desperate and utterly unconvincing. I used to enjoy Aimee Mann, but whenever I hear anything by her now I am reminded of the suffering I endured at the hands of this film.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The San Fernando Valley just got deeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of my favorite films. I keep running into people who diss this film for being too weepy and over the top and I could not agree less with them. Out of all of Anderson's movies, I think this is still by far the best. Yeah, I know that everyone is ranting over Punch Drunk Love, but for me Magnolia is so much broader and intricate and heartfelt and human, that it blows Punch Drunk out of the water. Every single performance in this film is exceptional, with special mention going out to Phillip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. And for all those people annoyed with Melora Walters for crying and being a wreck through the movie - what do you expect from an unhinged cocaine addict with no self-esteem, estranged from her parents and carrying the burden of one of the most damaging experiences we suffer from in modern society. This film to me was all about connecting, or the inability of to and the loneliness that we, as humans, so often carry with us. To call this a melodrama is ridiculous. Anderson fills the film with as much dark humor and hope as he does anguish. I especially loved the opening - the imagination of Anderson is one of a kind and he is a voice to be reckoned with. And what balls! How he got his whole cast, including Tom Cruise, to sing in the middle of the film, is a testament to his vision and the trust his actors put in him. Frogs falling from the sky, the power of the cock, child genuises, both present and past, parental estrangement, guilt, truth, the longing to reach out and the fear that stops us, this movie has it all. Like I said, one of my favorite films and definitely worth watching. If you don't get it, then it's beyond my comprehension.Awesome, awesome film. And P.T.? Don't let the system take your edge away because you're one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>even the title is an abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose "Magnolia" sounds more pleasant than the appropriate title for this movie: "Pretentious Drivel". In reality, magnolias are beautiful blossoms that last a very short time. This movie is the very embodiment of ugliness, and it just seems to go on for ever. If Mr. Anderson hadn't been so intent on wallowing in a sea of profanity, the film could well have been done in less than two hours. Why does Hollywood continue to revel in portrayals of how miserable western society has become? Critics love to describe such exposees as "visionary", which seems to indicate that if you live in a sewer, the best minds are those that can imagine just how filthy the sewer could be.I have recently begun to explore the genre of the film noir, and have really enjoyed some of the efforts that I felt did a very efficient job of conveying their message, notably Mulholland Drive and Requiem for a Dream. Magnolia seemed like it would be of the same calibre, but while those other films drew me inside of them for their duration (and then stayed inside of me for days after), this film was grating on my nerves before the opening credits had finished. The only redeeming quality was the soundtrack, but even at that, the opening song playing while several characters spoke at the same time (?!?) was little more than irritating.To me the test of a good story is that whatever kind of characters are portrayed, I should wind up being at least interested in seeing what happens to them, if not feeling outright sympathetic for their welfare. About 30 minutes into this flic, I was hoping for the quick and sudden deaths of pretty well the whole cast. The only ones I could possibly pity were the unfortunate young boy on the game show, and the frogs for having to fall into this film. Not a single one of them had a redeeming quality, and the story never gives reasons for them being that way. They all seem to be as base and vulgar as possible just because, and then gradually, again for no discernable reason, they all turn into pathetic wretches.And again, the profanity. Even if this was the perfect film, it would be all but nullified by the completely unnecessary vulgarity. It's bad enough that Hollywood has adopted the bizarre habit of introducing a single instance of their favorite four-letter word into almost every film they make these days, quite often in the most inappropriate context. But to see a film like this where the swear words outnumber the rest of the dialogue, one can only wonder what they are trying to prove. Are these people like schoolchildren who delight in the chance to swear to their hearts' content? I suppose the answer is "realism", and I suppose this answer satisfies most. If that is the case, I can only wonder why characters aren't defecating and urinating, because we must be too stupid to know that they also do these things without being shown them in graphic detail.This film is one of the more dismal I have ever seen, and I will make sure to avoid anything else done by Paul Thomas Anderson. He should watch Amadeus and take warning of what happens to mediocre artists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Altman + David Lynch = Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are spoilers in this review.Actually, neither Altman nor Lynch had anything to do with this engrossing but flawed film, but the combination of vignettes, wandering plotline, strange characters, and precise dialog leads one to believe that they might have collaborated on it. This is a very long film filled with some of the most pathetic characters you've ever seen.I remember when this film was released, it was labelled a `Tom Cruise film', even though everyone's favorite mediocre actor appears in it for roughly twenty minutes of screen time. As a motivational sex speaker for insecure men, he hams it up, walking around yelling and performing vulgar routines. With his long hair, sloppy clothes, and unwashed demeanor, he has the part nailed. He's treated like a demi-god, with buffers of people between himself and his father. Quite an elaborate setup for a man whose only claim to fame is that he casually tosses around the words for male and female genitalia, making his audience of sexually frustrated men hoot and holler.Okay, let's talk about swearing. Throughout the film, the f-word appears in roughly one out of every three words. In 1999, the year this film was made, the easiest job in the world was screenwriter for `Magnolia', because one-third of the script is the f-word. Everyone says it, from an angry little ten-year-old rapper to a dying Jason Robards, who plays a producer. Let's just say that you'd better have more than just a nodding acquaintance with the f-word before watching this film.What is `Magnolia' about? Hmm, that's a good question, because it puts me in mind of the mainstream experimental films of the 60s like Bonnie and Clyde, the Pawnbroker, and the Graduate, which all tried to change the way people viewed cinema. They did, but Magnolia seems more a pastiche of tried-and-true film techniques than a groundbreaking and modern way of viewing films. `Twin Peaks' and `Boogie Nights' certainly had a profound effect on the people who made this film; in fact, many of the actors from Boogie Nights are in Magnolia and the film has the same king of wandering, flowing, omniscient eye.The beginning of the film is much like Amelie, where we are given a primer on the oddity of coincidences: the strange story of the scuba diver who was scooped up in a fire-fighting plane when the plane dipped down to get water from a lake, and the suicidal boy who was shot while jumping to his death in a fall that otherwise would not have killed him. It's nice to see that screenwriters are just as susceptible to corny old urban legends as us normal folk, and cobbling together a script based on timeworn tales of irony probably sounded like a good idea at the time. This event sets the tone for the rest of the film, making you aware that you are about to see one large coincidence. Characters are thrown at you from right and left in quick, choppy scenes. They all gradually come together in a huge, interlocking circle of events and people. This film has the strange effect of rounding out the characters by showing their relationships to the world around them, much like those `reality' shows that are so popular on television right now. If you were God, this film is what you would see as you looked down on the earth.The performances are quite good all around. It's nice to see Melinda Dillon again, the mercurial Alfred Molina, William H. Macy and Jason Robards.Unresolved plotlines abound. The genius kid and his father: What happens to them? The game show host: Did he die? The frogs: where did they come from, and why so many? Reports of falling frogs stretch far back into human history, but they were small, while the frogs in the movie are huge. There is an undercurrent of unresolved plotlines in this film, probably because everyone was getting tired of shooting this film and wanted to go home, so they left things hanging. Well, I guess it leaves the door wide open for Magnolia 2.It's difficult to characterize this film as anything other than a meaner, uglier, American version of Amelie. Is this the new style of filmmaking? Who knows, it may last as long as the funky split screens of the 1960s (The Boston Strangler, for example) or it may set the standard for a new way of filmmaking. I'm still wondering if what I just saw was a big mess or a work of genius, but I'm tending toward the former. At three hours long, you probably will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a bad 20 car pile-up for 3 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure there will be many people who disagree with me (and considering how almost all of the first 20 comments I read called this movie classic and great, I very well be in the minority here), but I absolutely hated this movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a terrible movie - I've seen MUCH worse drivel than this (Hudson Hawk and The Big Hit, to name two) - but watching this movie was like watching a 20 car pile-up happen right before your eyes. It's both fascinating and disgusting at the same time.Okay, the movie starts out bizarrely enough, with all these little snippets that have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie except to promote the idea that chaos happens, so to speak. My guess is that P.T. Anderson had these wild images of a guy in scuba gear on top of a tree and another guy getting shot while falling, and didn't know what to do with them - so why not put them in this movie?There are a lot of faults with this movie, but the biggest one for me is all the overacting and bad dialogue that goes on in this movie. One prime example is when Julianne Moore goes to see her lawyer. When she doesn't get what she wants from him, her response to him is "F--- you". Okay, that'd be fine - but she has to repeat it like a mantra as she's walking out the door, raising the pitch of her voice to the point where she sounds like a 2 year old as she gets to the door. Maybe this is supposed to be there and I just don't 'get it' - but the same emotion that she needed to make could have been done much differently and wouldn't have come off making her sound like a baby.For the whole movie, there are characters that have the thinnest relationship with the other characters' stories, and we're not allowed to be emotionally involved with any of them, because we jump so fast from one story to the other that I watched the credits going "Huh?"Bottom line - if you want to see a good P.T. Anderson movie - see Boogie Nights (which is not the greatest movie ever either, but a hell of a lot better than this exercise in overindulgence).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boogie Nights was a fantastic film but this leaves it for dead. There's a lot to compare the two movies though. By pure chance, when I got home from the cinema from watching Magnolia, my housemate had rented Boogie Nights so I saw both films the same day. For a start, a lot of the actors appear in both movies, but most striking is the way all the different characters and their stories are woven into one piece. Another similarity is the way each character is developed. You can sense that P.T. Anderson had great affection for each one of them. These characters are developed far better than the standard black and white characters that Hollywood likes to churn out. Every detail sits, like the fact that William H. Macy as the former quiz show champ wears dreadful 80's clothes that illustrate that he's well beyond his peak.The acting is magnificent too, William H. Macy and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are outstanding like in every movie they are in. Hoffman even gets a chance to play a sympathetic character for once. Even non-actors like Tom Cruise put in a great performance. Never thought I'd say this... Best of all for me was John Reilly who played Reed Rothchild in Boogie Nights. He is in an entirely different role as an LAPD Police Officer here. When he gets into a shootout you can tell that he's not just scared of death, but rather there's a real sense you get that he thinks that he still has much to live for. The scene is so well played that I can't even think of any good way to describe it.I haven't quite figured out what the frogs were doing in the movie but I'll get to that sooner or later.This film restored my faith in the American movie industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last summer I picked up this movie for no reason other than the fact that Ebert named it the second best film of '99. I knew that it was a whopping three hours, eight minutes long so I made sure that I didn't have anything important to do that day (it was summer so that wasn't too hard) and settled down for it in the middle of the afternoon. Little did I know that I was just about to see one of the most moving, involving, best acted, best directed and best written movie ever made. Paul Thomas Anderson does an extraordinary job at filling the entire 2.35:1 image. He sets up certain shots to almost make them pass for a painting you'd find in a museum. From start to finish, just about every shot in the film seems to have taken hours to set up. All of the actors are top-notch. From Tom Cruise to Jeremy Blackman, everyone seems to be perfectly into their character and don't appear to be acting at all. All of the songs by Aimee Mann that appear periodically throughout the film seem to have been born to be in this movie. Especially Save Me which was a perfect way to end the movie. I'm not going to give away any plot element of the movie, especially the unforgettable conclusion, I'll just say that movies like this are one in a million. If we could have films as good as this every Christmas, Hollywood would be a much more successful place. I can't imagine why the film only made $22 million, though. Maybe the three hour running time scares people. Well, either way I strongly urge you to see this film if you haven't already. And if you can, be sure to see it in widescreen, it's unbelievable what is lost in the full screening.</fullReview>

The acting was good, the end was pretty cool, but the "story" bored me - and three hours of boredom is not a good thing.The movie constantly jumps around between storylines of different characters. I usually don't mind this, but in this movie it seemed to happen too much and seem pointless at times. By the end of the movie, I didn't really feel that anything had really happened, which is a real disappointment after three hours. This movie was also very depressing.Perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for a movie like this, but I'm pretty sure I just didn't like it :) 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody I knew told me to avoid this movie. Well, I saw it anyway, &amp; I must say... ... They could'nt have been more right about anything, ever!! This movie was basically, as a previous poster noted, 3 1/2 hours to tell you that life is random. What a horrible waste of time. I have never been so uninspired by a film. It was not beautiful, it was ugly. It was not perfection, it was 100% garbage. This film was also transparent, &amp; lacked all substance. Before anyone accuses me of being one-sided, I watched this junk 2 more times to try &amp; find something positive about it, because I really did want to say something positive about this film, &amp; diversified. But, IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT THERE! And don't kid yourself any further if you think there is! Also, about the completely fake overabundance of profanity, another prior poster had said that this is the way most people act in high pressure situations, &amp; such. That simply is not true. I've worked with many people over the years, &amp; even the ones that used profanity the most weren't nearly as profane as the characters in this film. Some of the Moore's role was OK for profanity, &amp; had an extremely slight bit of realism to it. But, otherwise, the rest is completely unbelievable, &amp; obviously fake. If Hollywood keeps releasing schmaltz like this, studios will lose alot of money in a little time.This movie was a complete load of nothing, don't waste your money to see it, you'll only be disappointed.</fullReview>

I can't believe so many people, &amp; critics alike loved this atrocious piece of garbage. It is not original nor is it in any way shape or form, a work of art. Those who defend this "movie" would say, "Oh, well you just don't get the deeper underlying meaning", or, "You don't know a true work of art when you see it!" Well, for one thing this "movie" had no deeper meaning, it was hollow &amp; depressing. And secondly, I know what good art is, &amp; this movie is not good art, unless if your idea of good art is one of those pieces where someone glues a bunch of sugar packets to a box, then someone pays 1000s for it! That's the type of person that would like this movie. This movie also has an extensively high overusage of the F word in it, everyone uses it, including the children in this "movie". I don't mind some profanity in a movie, but don't flood the whole thing with it! I think it was used mostly for shock value, but it wears off after hearing it 300x in 30 minutes. If you took all the F words out of it, the "movie" would only be about 15 minutes long. Take out all profanity, &amp; it would be about 5 minutes long. This movie has no redeeming value, &amp; I don't think I can respect any of the actors/actresses that participated in this garbage ever again. Horrible movie, waste of over 3 hours. Fortunately, I saw it for free, but it wasn't worth the time it took to watch it, I lost 3 hours of my life! Do yourself, a favor, if you haven't seen it, DON'T!! I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 0, for being such a nothing "movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just spent the last two hours of my life watching the DVD of Magnolia, for which I paid $4 in rental fees (plus tax). It felt like an eternity. If only time would fly when you're being bored like it does when you're having fun! One hour into it, I turned to my wife and I said, "I hope it gets better." Two hours in, knowing there was one more hour to go, I turned to my wife and asked, "Are you enjoying this?" Fortunately, I got the answer I was looking for, so I did not have to leave the room. (I have had oral surgery that was more enjoyable than watching this movie.) When I found out that Aimee Mann wrote the songs on the soundtrack, I thought, "Cool!" And the soundtrack album is pretty darned good, albeit partially a rehash of her "Bachelor No. 2" album. But not much of her music managed to sneak into the first 2 hours of the movie. I was far more patient with this movie than I should have been. If the film-makers cannot engage my attention and arouse my sympathy for their characters within 30 minutes (much less 120), then it's time to pull the plug and get on with life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did this movie crash and burn... the first 30 minutes were great by the examples of extreme coincidence. However the climax of the movie was lived nothing to the expectations given in by the introduction examples. This movie spread itself way to thin. Some of the stories never concluded, such as the rapping little boy and his murderer father Worm, that story was thrown out the window, and come on Stanley Specter telling his dad to be more nice to him??? Is that closure, or even come even close to tying into the freak coincidence that the viewer was told to be looking out for at the end of this picture, geez. Honestly i look at this move as a 179 minute commercial brought about to peddle some more Amie Mann records The funny thing is that the overall undertone of sappy cheesyness, its strategic release date in accord with the nightmarish 179-minute runtime gives me reason to believe P.T. Anderson was writing this screen play with a glimmer of Oscar gold in his eyes.

		<shortDescription>Emotional rollecoaster of several entwined story lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films I ever saw (and I have seen thousands of films) It focuses on coincidences that occur and starts of with completely different story lines which entwine at several times. The red line in the film is an extremely emotional journey in the lives of a group of individuals looking for happiness. The whole film spins around different characters for whom you can not help to feel sorry for as well as admire. Emotions run high and thanks to the incredible performances of the actors the film drags you down a sort of catharsis. The style of the film is almost a film noir but thanks to the humor it never feels like a pessimistic film. Each character is very well specified and seeing the movie you feel like you have only scraped the surface of the truth which leaves you wanting more. The role played by Tom Cruise in this film is completely different to all the other movies he has played in and I have to say that he really surprised me. The man watching over the sick TV-host was cast perfectly and I have to say that I have seen every film in which he played like *Love Liza* etc just based on his performance here (and I can't say I regret it) All in all this film gives you a peek into the lives of several characters that all have their own well thought out personality. Also William H. Macy surprises in this film as the loser kwis-boy.Basically there are 3 things that make this movie so great.1 The actors are all cast to perfection making the emotions, on which the movie drives, credible and stunningly beautiful2 The characters are incredibly detailed which is rather rare these days. Each character has it's own strange habits and it feels like each role was personalised and detailed to a degree where you really start to care for the strenghts as well as the weaknesses of the characters.3 The story is actually a cluster of stories that seem to fall perfectly in place. Just the sheer beauty of the markup of the movie makes it a must see. The dialogues are brought with extreme care and the way the story lines are entwined makes it no doubt that this was the hand of a professional and passionate crew. This type of movie has been done before but never did the result really live up the the goal.I could go on and on but I suggest you watch it to see for yourself. After that you have no other choice then to agree with me and conclude that this is one of the best movies ever!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No plot, bad characters, incomprehensible theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over three hours pass and not one of these worthless characters gets killed or goes through any life changing epiphony. After a few agonising hours of watching bad people make bad decisions that will only bring more pain and unhappiness into the world, frogs fall out of the sky. No really they do, a bunch of frogs, heavy gut filled frogs rain into frame and the characters seem to think that this sort of thing is perfectly normal. At first I just didn't get this film, then my pretentious film buff friends convinced me to take another more open minded look. Now that I feel I understand the film better I stand by my original assesment that it was a painful waste of my time.</fullReview>

(And, as someone else noted, get cancer) It was boring, rambling and pretentious. I wouldnt If I were you. Its also not that I dont like films which, as most people who like it will claim 'observe life'. I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens in that is that a load of Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film, and I used to work on a construction site. So go figure. Having said that William H. Macy made me grin. Once. 2/10.

		<shortDescription>Intense, Dynamic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange things happen in life; random occurrences sometimes so bizarre that the reality of it is often stranger than fiction, things one would say could only happen in a movie, and if they did, you wouldn't believe it. But then again, maybe those things happen in movies because they actually do happen in real life. And when they do, is it fate, or coincidence? Are these `random' acts isolated, or merely pieces of some larger, synchronistic puzzle that somehow fit together in the end? Thought provoking questions for the ages, some would say, proficiently addressed here by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson in his discursively brilliant film, `Magnolia.' Anderson puts the lives of a diverse cross-section of individuals and seemingly unrelated incidents under the microscope for an examination of these random acts and coincidences, from which he ultimately draws some conclusions about providence and happenstance. What he finds is fraught with irony and underscored by the notion that what happens to one must and does, in fact, effect another sooner or later, for better or worse. All of which serves to point out that no man stands alone; in the end, bills come due and must be paid. We must all face the consequences of past decisions and actions, at which time the relevance of the irrefutable symbiotic nature of Man comes so vividly into play, wherein dissimilar individuals may reap the benefits of simply being a part of the community of Humankind. Or then again, perhaps not. The story Anderson weaves is fast-paced, sometimes frantic, and thoroughly engrossing, achieving levels of emotional intensity that are at times remarkable. The quick pacing of the film belies the gradual way the story comes together to form the tangible connections derived from the intricacies of the plot. It's a dynamic piece of filmmaking, extremely well written and delivered by Anderson and his superb cast. There are a number of memorable performances here, among them Tom Cruise, who plays Frank T.J. Mackey, a self-styled guru of the `men's movement,' whose teachings are anathema to feminists everywhere. It's an intense performance (for which he deservedly received an Oscar nomination), quite unlike anything he's done before, and possibly his best work since `Rain Man.' Other notable performances are turned in by William H. Macy, as `Quiz Kid Donnie Smith,' the once gifted youth who emerges dysfunctional in adulthood, and by John C. Reilly, as Officer Jim Kurring, a caring individual with a truly benevolent nature. But the most superlative performance of the movie is given by Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a male nurse named Phil Parma. His sensitive, subtle portrayal of this caretaker to dying man Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), is delivered with nuance and incredible depth, and provides some of the most poignant moments in the film. While taking nothing away from Cruise, who was outstanding as well, Hoffman is the one who should have been nominated, moreover, should have won, the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. A performance just doesn't get any better-- or more real-- than this, and it is unacceptable that it should not be recognized as such. Rounding out what is, in essence, an ensemble cast, are Philip Baker Hall (Jimmy Gator), Julianne Moore (Linda Partridge), Melinda Dillon (Rose Gator) and Melora Walters (Claudia Wilson Gator). One of the best films of 1999, `Magnolia' conveys a moral without moralizing, is rich in metaphor and altogether captivating, with an ending that may take you aback, if indeed, you haven't been paying close attention (there are at least two clues during the film, admittedly obscure, but there nevertheless). It is intense, unremittedly so, and may leave you breathless and pondering the mysteries of life; but this is filmmaking at it's best, and especially for avid movie-watchers, one that absolutely must not be missed. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And then it rained frogs.I have a difficult time seeing what anyone could possibly like about this drivel. The acting was decent but hardly extraordinary, and while I can appreciate nice cinematography, I am not going to spend seven dollars to admire camera shots. I would like a plot thrown in there, too.While the 'different stories of seemingly unrelated characters' method can work quite well (the movie Playing By Heart comes to mind), what makes it work is when the 'seemingly unrelated characters' somehow come together so that there is some cohesiveness to the story which Magnolia does not have. One could stretch the imagination to find two plot lines running through the story, but since those plots never connect, they only emphasize the weaknesses of this movie.The characters were unlikeable and the ending was completely unsatisfactory. For some this might be visually engaging, but without a plot, it was just three hours too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Disappointing Film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing which always amazes me about critics and audiences alike is they spend far too much time analysing a film for its hidden messages, meanings, director's tricks, effort of the actors, etc - what about the entertainment value? The entertainment value in Magnolia is very low indeed. Having been absolutely thrilled by Boogie Nights, I had high hopes for Magnolia. Sadly, as with M. Night Shyamalan's (sp?) Unbreakable and especially Signs, I was very disappointed. I cannot imagine what Paul Thomas Anderson wants to get across with Magnolia, and I really couldn't care. No one should have to rack their brain to come up with a message or meaning which isn't halfway powerful or important. The underlying messages are not as crucial as those in, say, Don't Look Now (1973). The performances were either completely overbearing, ie. Tom Cruise, or completely wooden, ie. John C. Reilly. I think much less of Reilly after seeing him in this piece, especially after his fantastically understated performance in Boogie Nights (what a combination of troublemakers - Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and Thomas Jane - ha!). Julianne Moore takes herself waaaaaaaay too seriously in this film, as do many of the other actors. At least Heather Graham isn't in this trying to play any part other than Rollergirl. The narrative meanders pretentiously in and out of ludicrously simple stories which drag on and on and on - and just when you think its hit the worst, most poshest point of movie-making arrogance, down come the frogs! And what a terrible song! How completely talentless the music is compared to that of Boogie Nights! All in all, if you have any sense of what movies are here to do (no, no, no - not inspire us or depress us or test our culture or appreciation for art), then stay away from Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson - if you cannot entertain whilst putting across your message, you simply have not mastered the art of movie-making. I'm not saying a movie has to be full-on action or comedy or mindless junk like Gone in 60 Seconds to entertain - but if it's going to be deep, make it entertainingly deep for heaven's sake! There are many very clever ways to bring meaning to the screen without sacrificing the entertainment! Tell me - exactly which part of your movie was meant to initially draw my interest?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this movie. I actually sat through it five times, only to discover that it still made no sense. A movie that essentially was about these inept people whose lives are so empty and so pointless that they have seek some kind of "redemption" made me think that Paul Thomas Anderson is making fun of the audience instead of making a real movie. Indeed, "Boogie Nights" was good. "Magnolia" was not. I thought that the plot, such that it was, made very little sense. The characters were weak, and the movie overall was better suited to people who need to be told that at least their lives aren't that pathetic, unlike this movie. If you want to rent it, don't. If you have it, take it back and get a refund. If you really want to watch it, you have been warned.</fullReview>

Anderson has the non-talent to waste our time with empty, meaningless characters in implausible situations speaking insipid dialog. Like "Boogie Nights", the characters are wooden and provide no insight into the modern human condition. I've sat through films much longer than 'Magnolia' ('Berlin Alexanderplatz', directors cut of 'Fanny and Alexander') yet with those films, I remained totally enthralled. 'Magnolia' is mind-numbingly boring.Worthless movie garbage!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, when I hear "self-indulgent", I think Paul Thomas Anderson. Maybe it was his unconstructive and misguided lambasting of the modern masterpiece Fight Club, or maybe it's just all of Magnolia. Could there be anything more self-indulgent than a three hour long character montage? And how painful it is. It just keeps cutting and cutting and cutting as the music keeps looping and looping and looping, and it really FEELS like a montage. Quirky as the concept may be, did any of the people responsible for putting the words "final cut" in Anderson's contract stop to think about just how exhausting and aggrivating it would be for an audience to watch a movie that moves at the montage's unnaturally rapid rate for three hours? Despite the amazing acting and (to an odd extent) well-developed characters, I couldn't help but leave the movie feeling more than just a little disappointed. The idea that the film centers around a seemingly-unrelated group of characters who actually share a common thematic thread has been done before and done better (see: Exotica). Though this film is not afraid to dive deep into each of its characters, Magnolia just doesn't have the payoff. Forgive me, but after watching three hours of largely vague and cryptic dialog take place over an unusually annoying soundtrack (that loops the same tinny violins for half-hour chuncks at a time)in order to slowly and meanderingly develop sub-plots (as there is no real main plot to speak of)that are equally vague, I want some character resolution. Well, if you want to see a movie that features well-developed characters that are involved in intriguing events that satisfactorily climax and fulfill the viewer, you'll only get 2/3 of the equation from Magnolia. And in a way, that's even more cruel than if the movie were just flat-out bad. It seems as though Magnolia spends three hours building up epically and enthrallingly to a grand conclusion and then... the credits roll. I understand how the frog thing is a metaphor for man's absurdity, and that all these characters that fight for control are leading themselves in futility and the magic factor of the unpredictable and blah blah blah... and that's all well and good, but it doesn't make up for the fact that you never know what the heck happens to any of the characters and their situations after that takes place. Oh sure, there are quick little subtle things that take place and successfully tie up the most desperately dangling elements of the plot, and there are some hints at changes in the characters, but it's almost like the movie is actually six hours long and everybody only has the first half. It seems like it should keep right on going and it just stops. Almost everything is left hanging. None of the cryptic dialogue is made clearer, the characters are not given just resolution, there is no significant lesson to be learned, and there is in fact little more than disappointment. The whole movie, you sit there and think "Okay, this is interesting... where are they going with this?"... and in the end you realize the horrible truth: nowhere. And that's when I begin to think about P.T. Anderson's self-indulgence... I can't help but think of him dancing around on the DVD documentary as he is editing the film, gleefully spouting lines about how people won't understand it. He is truly like a kid at play, and it shows, because in the end none of the work is done. He tries so hard to deliberately attempt to break every formula possible, even the formula of storytelling, which may be good for the dancing director, but becomes agony for the poor, disappointed audience. * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a tiresome movie! With the exception of the interesting love story between the cop and the coke addict, this film consists mainly of people screaming incoherently at each other and using the f-word more times than I've seen in any other film. The director seems to have enjoyed Robert Altman's _Shortcuts_, and tried, unsuccessfully, to steal as much of the plot and style (and even an actor) from Altman as he possibly could. Julianne Moore embarrasses herself trying to pass off incoherent swearing as anger, and Tom Cruise soon follows suit in his own humiliating attempt at being really really angry at his dying deadbeat dad. The only truly memorable scene was the overhead view of a falling frog, who had the best line in the film: "Ribbit!"Unless you look forward to watching people being angry and mean to each other for three hours, do yourself a favor and rent Shortcuts, or read a good book. To borrow a line repeated in Magnolia: "We may be through with pretentious cinema, but it isn't through with us."</fullReview>

Anderson supercharges the screenplay with enough energy to make its 188 minutes of misery, conflict, and wretchedness pass swiftly. Unfortunately, there's so much going on, character development is sacrificed and when the end comes we're not likely to really care one way or another about any particular individual and are left with only one burning question.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best movie ever created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PT Anderson has surpassed his past opus "Boogie Nights" with this gem of a film. One cannot even begin to absorb the true beauty of it with one screening. The acting, for lack of a better not-so-trite word, is amazing. Especially that of John C. Reily who nails the part of a cop. Perhaps what makes the film the most unique is the pacing. Just when the audience wants to slow down, take a breath, and absorb the movie, They hear a lawyer say "Slow down, take a breath". Anderson lets his viewers know, there is no easy way out of this one. But the stand out scene (and acting for that matter) is when William H Macy's Character Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, enters a bar and fights in an almost Oscar Wilde manner with the Antagonist Solomon Solomon. And of course there is the films climax. Which is so unexpected, so far fetched, one cannot claim it to be improbable or even silly. By the end of the film, we see "This is the way things are, we have a second chance, if we don't take it, then we fall victim to chance."</fullReview>

I have no explanation as to why so many people would find this movie well done let alone worth sitting through three hours for. Don't get me wrong this movie had a hell of a lot of potential but stringing together a plot line of 10 characters who need a serious kick in the pants for them to complete a coherent thought just completely ruined it for me. This brings me to another point. I foresee this movie becoming one of those films that people like because they are "supposed" to like. NO! This is not a culturing, artistic experience.

I couldn't help myself asking this question after sitting through this long borefest. Is P.T. Anderson trying to say life is messed up and many people are lost? Does it really take 3 hours to show this point? I guess he is also trying to say that things happen by chance, but it is not really a chance at all. Something greater is at work here connecting people's lives together. Interesting point, but he does not do that in the movie! There are some strong performances, especially by Tom Cruise, but the entire movie is not worth the sum of its parts. It has many characters I didn't care about. It had many stories I didn't care about. Some people really like this movie, but I think they are looking deeper into something that isn't really there.

		<fullReview>There are movies that are made to entertain, some to tell a story, some to teach, some to shock...and I could go on and on. I finally got to watching Magnolia after hearing both good and bad things about the film.I will say that the performances were pretty good. John C Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman kept the film glued together. Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and the typically good William H Macy were so over-the-top in their performances but that's nothing new for Cruise and Moore.I found the story engaging but I found it even more pretentious. Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be forcing his storytelling skills, trying to pound it over the head of the viewer with a sort of "gee, aren't I clever" feel to it.So much wasted actors and actresses, so many scenes that were achingly long and could have been edited seemed to make me more agitated. I kept wanting Anderson to get to his point. Yes, it is obvious he was having fun getting to the end and the way things would tie together (loosely). But the smug way in which we got there left me wanting to punch Anderson rather than pat him on the back.Does it deserve to be in the top 250? Don't ask me. I'd have given it about 6 out of 10 and that was being generous because of some of the performances. I really found Anderson's Magnolia nothing more than a pretentious, pompous slab of cinematic snobbery that tried to force you into believing he is a quality writer and director.</fullReview>

I walked out of the theater completely disappointed.I recently had a second chance to view it as a friend of mine rented it. I decided I would put my previous judgments aside and watch it with no expectations and I was still very disappointed.Acting wise, this movie was great. William Macy and Julianne Moore were brilliant and passionate as always. Tom Cruise gave his best performance since "Interview With the Vampire." Jason Robards gave a great performance in one of his last movies. But even all these actors giving their all couldn't make me like this.I love deepness in movies. It is a quality lacking in most of today's films. Only a few movies in recent years have succeeded in this. "American Beauty" and "Fight Club" being two that come to mind. But "Magnolia" fails about doing this and instead comes across as pretentious while wasting over 3 hours to give a message that can be summed in two words. "S**t Happens."For my dollar I'll take "American Beauty" over this any day. Save your money.

Anderson's direction of his own wonderfully original screenplay is like nothing you've ever seen before.The film opens with three dramatizations of chance occurrences that most people would deem as "just one of those things," or coincidences. From here, there is a cut to a beautiful unfurling magnolia accompanied by Aimee Mann's gorgeous version of Harry Nilsson's "One" (if you look closely, you can see a street sign that reads Magnolia). During the remainder of the song, Anderson introduces us to the dozen-plus main characters. We are fed only a dash of these strangers' lives, but we are instantly mesmerized. Soon, the tempo of the film slows down, and Anderson allows us to relate to the individuals of his superb cast.In the middle of the surrounding stories lies the story of an unappreciated cop (the under-used John C. Reilly) and a coke-sniffing, self-esteemless girl (Melora Walters) falling in love. Finding love and overcoming fear of rejection are only two of the recurring themes of this film. Among the other ideas that surface are understanding when to help (rather than punish) and making amends for past mistakes.The third act, which features the entire cast participating in an Aimee Mann sing-along of "Wise Up" and an apocalyptic wake up call from the heavens (br ush up on your Bible knowledge, Exodus 8:3), is where even some Magnolia proponents stray. In my eyes, this section demonstrates Anderson's originality to bring all the characters together through one supernatural event. Its effects are the epitome of all "coincidences."Magnolia is truly one of the finest films I have ever seen (certainly Anderson's best). Like his previous films (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights), Anderson's Magnolia explores the importance of love and family to give an individual self-worth. As Aimee Mann's "Save Me" accompanies the conclusion of the film, we remember that we do need others to help us overcome adversity, and that we cannot make it through this life alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an utter piece of c**p. Totally unengaging, the characters are uninteresting and in some case downright deplorable, and there's not enough tie-in to make you feel like you're watching one movie instead of 3 or 4. Other than a stupid producer credit and the fact that a bunch of characters pass each other at a particular corner before a stupid rain of frogs, this was three different shows. Whoopee. I can get better crossovers on a bunch of freaking sitcoms. Pulp Fiction this ain't. American Beauty this ain't. Entertaining this ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is one of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a narration of Internet/Urban myths. If you've ever surfed-the-Net or been part of an email chain, then you've heard about the SCUBA diver, the suicide murder, and the coincidence of names. (WARNING: I'm going to reveal the surprise ending.) The movie ends with a plague of biblical proportions. Los Angeles suffers a rain of frogs. In between, there is 3 hours of some of the most uninteresting characters and situations to hit the big screen since `Bulworth.' The acting is terrible. Julianne Moore (one of my favorites) says the F word more times than Heather Donahue in `The Blair Witch Project.' Tom Curse struts. Jason Robards moans. Philip Seymour Hoffman stands around looking dumb. Jeremy Blackman wets his pants. The screenplay and direction are poorly executed attempts to copy what Raymond Carver and Robert Altman accomplished with `Short Cuts.' The soundtrack is so over bearing that there are many scenes where it's difficult to hear what's being said. And finally, I hated the theme. `You can try and forget your past but your past won't forget you.' I refuse to believe that my future choices and actions are directed by my past. Or as Jessie Ventura might say, determinism is for the weak minded. I'd prefer sitting through the dubbed, Serbo-Croatian translation of `My Dinner With Andre' three times rather than watch `Magnolia' again.</fullReview>

If you thought "Meet Joe Black" had long, elliptical scenes with repeated dialogue and redundancy, you ain't seen nothing yet.I saw the previous version, the 3.5 hour version, not the current 3 hr, 10 min version. If you love overacting, bad writing, depressed and depressing characters, and boring scenes, then you'll love "Magnolia". "Boogie Nights" is bad, but at least Anderson was forced to focus. "Magnolia" is unfocused and awful. It's tanking in the box office, and you know what? It deserves to, just as "Boogie Nights" did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated film of '99</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Boogie Nights (impossible for me to say how "great" it is, since I only caught it on video), and so I was quite prepared to be impressed by Magnolia. It was not to be. Anderson has said he threw just about everything he has (artistically? thematically? I assume the latter) into this film, and it's a botch. Many of the early scenes and most of the performances work well, but when the various story lines and themes come together towards the end, the whole contraption lies revealed as over-solemn and pretentious in a sadly sophomoric way. The script is very much the product of a college-level mind grappling with Issues about which it lacks the ability to say anything profound. And it sinks the movie.Anderson may be a fine film artist who will yet do some exciting work. But as a writer, Boogie Nights may be all he really has in him. I would suggest he put down his laptop, search amongst the scripts floating around Hollywood for one that suits his temperament, and film it. Good way to get on with the career.</fullReview>

Man, I hate when that happens.Of course, in this stinker, things like that are happening all the time to a lot of people. These people have a lot of angst. And (Surprise!) they live in California (Motto: We have enough angst to export!). And in between expressing angst, they like to swear. I won't use the exact words here, but they rhyme with sock plucker, brother ducker, truck, muck my trick, go luck yourself. The only thing that doesn't seem to generate angst is their constant profanity.Now I should tell you there are times when characters aren't swearing or being affected by cancer. They like to stare, too. Add up the staring, the swearing and the cancer stuff and it makes a long, boring movie. The only movie I remember being this boring is Short Cuts. And in the intricate lattice that is our universe, it's directed by the same director! (Can you believe it?) Of course, in Magnolia, there are many more characters you don't relate to and don't care about. I think Short Cuts is a little shorter (more irony), so technically, on the list of movies I never want to see again, it would rank ahead of Magnolia.If you liked this movie, I hope your passion for profanity and angst as well as your clinical voyeurism gets better. (But because most angst lovers are only happy when they're sad, so maybe I should hope you get worse.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Year's Worst "Art" Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" does not make any real statements. It only plays cheaply on the viewer's emotions. The large cast and intricate plot are not signs of genius. The film simply has too many elements, few of which deserve to be recorded. Because there is so much material, almost none is well developed. The dialogue is laughable, not poignant. The characters wallow outrageously in their own problems in a way that is obnoxious, not endearing. The "coincidence" bit is trite. There is no idea here that has not been much more eloquently expressed elsewhere. If you like coincidence, try "Twenty Bucks." For the way our lives are intertwined with those of strangers, see the much more subtle masterpiece "The White Balloon," directed by Abbas Kiarostami. Many other good films have already done what this terrible one attempts.There are a few decent performances; Tom Cruise is an exquisite villain, but his redemption scene is pathetic. William H. Macy, magnificent in "Pleasantville" and a David Mamet regular, here seems able to do nothing but whine. Macy can't be blamed, because one could say exactly the same thing about the film as a whole. I would not recommend "Magnolia" to anyone. Rarely have I felt that my time was so utterly wasted.</fullReview>

His acting has never been better; he is the highlight of this film. Besides, to deliver such dialogue with a straight face is a true thespian feat.What remains beyond those two distinct shining lights is an incoherent, irrelevant jumble of junk, aspiring to the levels of Robert Altman but falling to the depths of trash.

		<shortDescription>1999's Biggest Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's such a shame to see so many wonderful actors go to waste. Paul Thomas Anderson, whose wildly over-praised "Boogie Nights" first proved that he had a knack for casting, outdoes himself in "Magnolia," uniting an all-star cast of independant film favorites for what has to be one of the biggest downers of 1999. One would hope that in a year with films like "Fight Club," "American Beauty" and "Three Kings," filmmakers would finally have learned that discussing dramatic subjects in film doesn't have to feel like pulling teeth, but Andersen has apparently gleaned no such lesson from other movies. His "Magnolia," which I suppose proports to be about the difficulties of familial relationships (and how parents are constant disappointments to their children), feels more like a 3-hour lesson in how not to structure a narrative. The opening 20 minutes, though intriguing, make little sense with the rest of the film. They're about how random chance and coincidence run the world. This would then lead one to think that the ensemble drama they are about to see reflects this theme, using coincidence to unite several stories into one unified tale. This, unfortunately, never happens. As anyone who recalls the last half-hour of "Boogie Nights" will attest (although that film's end is hardly memorable), Andersen doesn't believe in ending his stories. He just likes to throw 10 or so characters into a situation, let them talk about it for 3 hours, and then tack some violent or otherwise ludicrous ending in there as an excuse to eventually roll credits. In "Boogie Nights," it was a daring doughnut shop robbery. In "Magnolia," it's a rain of frogs. Either way, it makes you wonder why the hell you bothered investing 3 hours of your life on such trite nonsense. Andersen is being hailed by some as the savior of cinema at the close of the century. Might I humbly submit a list of young directors who have made better films this year: David Fincher, Sam Mendes, Alexander Payne, Spike Jonze, David O. Russel, Kimberley Pierce and Doug Liman.Lonnie</fullReview>

I had never heard anything about it; it was a gamble, and I lost. I'm keeping it to remind myself "never again".I totally agree with "epigone", "canalegrande" and "fletch-6": this movie has no entertainment-value. Except for John Reilly's (Jim Kurring) role, I found no redeeming quality. The rest of the movie was so rotten, it ruined this small part. I am no prude; vulgarity doesn't offend me, I can be as foul-mouthed as anyone.....but, there needs to be a purpose for it. P.T. Anderson, while he was writing his script - and those who truly enjoyed the film - must have been on an acid-trip. If I were a guest in a home where it was going to be shown, I'd have to excuse myself. Like one other "user", my VHS-player has not forgiven me for playing it.Although many "users" comment that it's true-to-life, if that's the case I'll watch Disneyland. I don't need to be reminded how ugly life and people can be; when I watch a movie, I want to escape to a place that will bring me pleasure and a little knowledge which might be new to me. I couldn't care less how much fame a "star" has, I don't need to hear all that vulgarity. I'm sorry they had to play such unpleasant roles. They must have needed to pay the rent......All those who are into this genre of movie, I respect your choice, but you can have it. I rated it "awful" because that's how I felt about it - I wish I could give it double-zero. My hope is that intelligent and sophisticated viewers have read some of these comments and realize it's something they don't want to waste their time on.

Don't get me wrong - I love unexplained weirdness (Book of the Damned type stuff), but I was disappointed in this overindulgent mess in which ranting and raving characters scream profanities. The dogs were cool, the frogs a joke. Andersen tries to bring everything together with a biblical rain of frogs, big monster bullfrogs falling from the skies in the San Fernando Valley (right out of Exodus 8). It doesn't work. He made the jump from what was set up to be strange but true phenomena and bizarre coincidences to pure, laughable overwrought melodrama.

		<fullReview>This movie is terrible. The story is nonsense and the direction is pathetic. It's too long a movie, 3 hours too long. Whole songs are played loud while the camera focuses on people's faces. A dying man has a monologue. A *FIFTEEN MINUTE* monologue in which he tells us nothing we dont know already. There's no plot. If they tell you there's a deeper meaning, they are morons. Are people becoming so completely dumb that they think they like a movie just because it's got foul language, drugs, child abuse and dead frogs?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't fall asleep watching this movie... that wouldn't have been too bad. No, instead, I invested almost three hours of my life trying to relate to any one the characters in this movie... trying to understand the plot that would surely tie everything together... and the more my anticipation built, the more i set myself up for disappointment at the end. What a cop out. I was insulted, and furious that I had invested my time and attention in this movie. It actually put me in a bad mood. Don't tell me it was "deep", or that "it really makes you think" I am not picky. I can count on one hand the number of movies I dislike. This was by far... the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply terrible - and greasy to the extreme. It strongly remembered me on "Short Cuts" a genius movie by Robert Altman. Magnolia is clearly a rip-off, the characters and even some scenes look very similar. In the first hour, I still thought this movie could be good - the beginning was kind of promising. But it is really a very bad rip-off. And forget the argument, that the actors are great: they are not! The only well played scenes are the ones, where Tom Cruise plays the macho - thats kind of amusing. The rest of the actors play very exaggerated and unauthentic. The worst is Julianne Moore, but perhaps simply had a very bad role. The whole movie long, everyone either cries or screems (and keep in mind, that the movie is 3 hours long). The thing that bothered me most is that the movie has absolutely no meaning - no smart statement, nothing. I know that the movie tried to look smart somehow - but in the end it is a stupid meaningless fairy-tale.</fullReview>

I couldn't like any of the people whose lives I was seeing tiny shards of. Though I wanted to see how all this would come together brilliantly in the end, I couldn't stand the headache I was getting from too many competing noises and soap opera tidbits, so I shut the damned thing off. No movie is worth enduring that agony. End of review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only this movie hadn't been nominated for anything...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... because of it's nomination, I decided I would sit through this movie until the end. I kept hoping it would become... well... watchable? Yep, that's the word. It certainly never GOT watchable. The opening # w/ the song "One" was irritating, but I gave it it's shot. By the end of the first tape, I was pretty sure it wouldn't get any better. By the end of the second... I was really upset that I'd bothered to rent it. What's so bad?Plot: none that comes together. If you keep thinking that all of the storylines will come together, in some depressing, artsy, and pointless version of "Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels" all I can say is, you're SOL. The movie starts out with 2 or 3 plots. And it ends with 2 or 3 plots. Two of them mix... but none of them come to any conclusion, and at no point do they ALL come together.The characters: Bah. Perhaps they were somewhat realistic, before the actors got a hold of them, but in the finished product they all seem fake as hell, becauseThe acting: Sucks. Kind of like Kabuki, in that a.) everything is incredibly overstated, but b.) if you're incredibly anal you'll find subtleties. Not a SINGLE piece of dialog, other the incoherent ramblings of a doped-up dying old man (which are incoherent, and ramble), is delivered in anything LIKE the manner a real person would use. The dialog is HEAVILY contrived. Tom Cruise really was ok - his dialog sucked but it ALMOST sounded natural from him. I was impressed. The cop - if you see it, you'll know who I refer to - was just SO bad a character and acted SO badly I developed a physical reaction to him coming on screen. Specifically, nausea. And finally...The frogs: the movie got fun for approximately 10 minutes. Why? Because the fact that a bible verse involving Egypt and the plagues was mentioned hours ago does NOT mean that millions of frogs raining from the sky in modern-day LA for NO reason whatsoever makes ANY sense at all. So incredibly whimsical, I laughed in shock through the entire sequence.In short: it's not artistic, it's artsy crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen Magnolia and just want some validation that you are not alone in hating it, this is it. If you have not seen Magnolia and want to decide whether to view it or not, may I suggest you read as many reviews as possible -- or make sure it is affordable for you to throw away your money first. I am a published author who spent an enormous amount of time in writing classes digesting the idea that stories have beginnings, middles and ends. Magnolia has no such sensibility. It also lacks the storyteller's sense of fair play toward the audience when it BLATENTLY leaves out the answers to the very questions it raises. If you love to stare at paintings and come to your own conclusions, Magnolia is your kind of movie. But if you like to go on a journey that has a concise outline and delivers what it promises to deliver, don't bother renting Magnolia.</fullReview>

(Believe me, if I had been by myself I would have left early and not suffered past the midpoint of the movie.)It displaced Eraserhead as the worst movie I'd ever seen, so if you loved Eraserhead, you'll probably like this movie as well.</fullReview>

Then I took the foot out of my mouth and was holding the razors to my wrists. Tom Cruise saying "Respect the Cock"? This role was not him at all. The characters had no good traits about them except for the cop. He was the only one oyu could feel compassion for. The others you couldn't help but not feel for them. The gay salesman, the pretty boy self-help guru, the addict, the mean father, the slut, the alcoholic. There was no redeeming value at all and there was no good ending. I can say for this movie I felt more stupid when I left the theatre and unfortunately I blew the afternoon because the movie was only 3+ hours long. Tom stick with Jerry Maguire and Top Gun.

		<shortDescription>What?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked "Shine" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?Having said that, there is nothing held back about "Magnolia." Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous."Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, "This is stupid!" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, totally uninteresting and never ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most boring, pointless movies I've ever seen. I kept watching it, hoping, sooner or later, it would get interesting, but it just dragged on and on. The way it begins, it indicates that it is going to draw all the characters together, eventually. It doesn't happen. (Unless you count the stupidity of the frogs!) It is a series of events, that don't connect, but play out their own little dramas. Some are mildly interesting, most aren't. The strongest point the movie makes is how we are products of our childhood, however, the point has been made before, only MUCH better. The only reason I was able to watch Tom Cruise was because he played a fool ~ no surprise, to me, that he played his part well. It was laughable to see how they enhanced his *package* in the scene in which he appears in his briefs - it sure hasn't looked like that in any other of his movies. (Yes, I have watched a few before he became the biggest joke on the planet).The only highlights were the performances by William H. Macy and Philip Seymour Hoffman (as usual). I did give it an honest try but all it provided me with was 3 hours I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful, and an indie-killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly believe dreadful movies like "Magnolia" cause more damage to the indie scene than a thousand "Armageddon"'s. What we have here is a dreary, self-indulgent three-hour romp of little to no consequence. The only reason it has high scores is that it gives movie fetishists something to yak about when they get out of the theater and go back to their boring lives. Let's be serious: this movie is terrible. Frogs fall from the sky. A black kid raps about a crime he saw (if any other filmmaker had done this, cries of 'racism!!!' would be raining like ... well, frogs). A bunch of other people whine about how hard life is. Julianne Moore is her usual terrible self, particularly in her big scene (in the drug store) where you can see the wheels turning right beneath the surface, as if she's screaming to herself "Make this scene as bad as you possibly can! Chew scenery if you have to!". How does this woman continue to find work? And, in the most cringe-inducing montage of all time, everyone looks at the camera and sings along with a song on the soundtrack.This movie is not beautiful, it is not graceful, it is not art. It is self-indulgence. Before Hollywood became a cesspool they had the ability to blend art with practicality. Much like Lennon and McCartney did for pop music, Hollywood could play intelligence and invention off of what was necessary to make a movie watchable. By eschewing this approach, all "art" movies have become tiresome, lengthy plods through the writer's ego, while mass-market movies aren't even worth the paper napkin on which they're sketched. Perhaps if P.T. Anderson could swallow some pride and hire a decent editor, he could make a movie worthy of his reputation. Until then he just goes in my big pile of "artsy" movie-makers to avoid, along with Terrence Malick and Jim "Ghost Dog" Jarmusch.</fullReview>

I also sat through 6 hours straight of Pride and Prejudice and liked it well enough.) I kept waiting for some kind of "salvation" for these characters. A glimmer of hope and redemption. It never came.Some have called Magnolia such things as "art", "masterpiece", "brilliant", "fantastic", "genius". It was none of those things, in my opinion.

Great, so this movie is going to draw on that theme, maybe like 'Lock, Stock' but more dramatic. And then we are introduced to the very large cast of characters. Wow, it sounds like a great movie and you can't wait to see how it all comes together.But the thing is, it never comes together. After 2 hours hours of watching the actors act, I got tired of being impressed by their human frailties, and the travails of their everyday lives. One character is a womanizer because his father was. One character is adamant that he needs braces for his perfectly straight teeth because... well, you'll see, but it's a stupid reason. All of the characters have their little faults and their personalities are explored pretty well. And I wouldn't mind watching a movie with any one of them, if that story had a plot. This movie has no plot. It soldiers on for 3 hours and then there is a frog storm.I don't understand why this movie is in the top 250. I guess it's because it's packed with stars. Stars acting in an art film equals art. But to me is was just boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is without exaggeration the single worst movie I have ever seen. Other movies have been as bad, but no movie this bad has been this long. If you want 10 different melodramatic soap opera vignettes, I suggest you save yourself the $7 and watch daytime TV. Or if you want interesting intersecting story lines, try "Short Cuts."Watching magnolia is akin to torture. I was literally tortured sitting in the theatre for 3+ hours. I like slow movies. I like many boring movies. But usually most artsy/slow movies have some positive things about them. Maybe they are interesting, maybe they have interesting characters, maybe there is something clever about them, or they have some point to make. Magnolia is 10 or so barely related story lines which purport to have some intersections/coincidences among them. I defy anyone to name one single coincidence among the stories. Just one. I defy anyone to care about any of these characters either. They are flat.Each story line goes nowhere. Each story line is boring. The acting is a notch above soap opera, but the plots are not. Then comes the oh so clever raining frogs, the absolute high point of Magnolia's humor. Wow that was funny. Raining frogs, whoah watch out.If you like your movies long, boring, pointless, endless building tension with appropiately cheesy music that refuses to resolve, and if you like to see characters with their head in their hands crying, only to come back to them 5 minutes later and they're still crying, only to come back to them 5 minutes later, and they're still crying....until frogs rain, this is the movie for you. Absolute torture.See Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" for a real movie about intersecting story lines - it's funny, has a point, and the plots are actually interesting.</fullReview>

Everyone had the same attitude and perspective from start to finish.Insanely long scenes - That dying old guy would talk and talk and it isn't entertaining or essential to the plot...he was just talking. If the objective was to make someone feel like they had to sit and watch someone that they didn't know or care about ramble on and die, then the objective was achieved. So many scenes went on 3 and 4 times longer than they should have and they weren't entertaining.No coincidence to tie it all together - I kept waiting...it never came. If i knew that all the subplots would remain subplots and never come together, i would have stopped watching two hours earlier. They made a big deal about coincidences in the beginning and never had one of their own.thats just the tip of the iceberg and this was the worst movie of all time...hands down</fullReview>

One good thing about this movie is that it finally made me realize that I really don't like Tom Cruise; horrible acting for a horrible character by a terrible actor--very fitting. People may think this movie is trying to be "deep" or something, but they must be pretty shallow themselves in order to think that this adolescent tripe is actually thought-provoking. This is brain candy for a grade-schooler at best, or juvenile existentialism, if you will. The bottom line is: don't waste three hours of your precious time on this piece of crap.

		<shortDescription>The most horrible movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until the day I saw Magnolia, I never had the pleasure of telling someone what my most hated movie was. I'm not even going to go into the details about the monstrosity that is Magnolia except I will say it's a movie that tries extremely hard to be artsy and deep and fails miserably. Don't get me wrong, I love movies that actually ARE artsy and deep. I think the people enjoying this movie are the ones who WANT to be intelligent but don't realize they are getting ripped off with every moment of this movie they view. To get a really good idea on what watching Magnolia makes you feel like, have someone poke you incessantly for three hours while coming down off of an amphetamine high. I know hate is a strong word, and there isn't any movie I hated more than this piece of trash. I really can't stress it enough. So if you like thought provoking, intelligent cinema (Fight Club? Vanilla Sky?), don't touch this with a 10 foot pole. If you worship David Lynch, you will probably love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many people, I saw Magnolia based on Anderson's work with Boogie Nights. Boogie Nights was a well made picture despite its priggish sensibility, which may have been necessary to get a commercially viable rating. Magnolia, however, is one of the most boring, obscure, pretentious, self-indulgent pictures I have ever seen. This picture is for people who buy Jaguars and like rude waiters. Magnolia is a complete waste of great actors who do a terrific job with characters who have no context in a non sequitur plot. Elements of magic realism are appropriated to juice up a flat story. I will bet that 10 years from now my view of this picture will be vindicated. The real mystery is how this sort of nonsense becomes the flavor of the month. I suspect that the popularity of this picture is based on the desire of people to be in the in crowd, which "gets" avant-guard film even when there is nothing to get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no BOOGIE NIGHTS. This is what happens when one of these young hot-shot writer-directors get too much power too soon. A three hour yawn-fest, this film drones on and on with nowhere to go and nothing relevant to say about anything. It's an exercise in super-arsty filmmaking with no reason to watch other than to observe the director's almost ridiculous level of self-indulgence.The script is just plain weak. It follows five or six characters that sort-of interconnect with one another. But it's hard to put any stake in these characters and situations. The dialogue is like meaningless poetry, where the characters talk at length about love, life and blah-blah-blah. What's the point? One of the stories, featuring William H. Macy as a former game show child-star facing a midlife crisis, is an absolute waste of time. It could be cut entirely and nothing else in the movie would be affected. Shouldn't that tell you something? The rest of the stories you could find on any average prime-time TV drama. The fact that they're well acted and directed with some sense of flair helps, but doesn't serve to rescue the film from tedium. You know it's a bad film when it could end at any time after the ninety-minute mark and it wouldn't be a jolt to the audience. The thing goes on for three hours, but if you leave at the second hour, you won't miss anything too important. There is no proper denouement in any of the stories aside for the TV game show host (Phillip Baker Hall) subplot. It's obvious that Anderson had no predetermined outcome for this thing. By the time the third act rolls around, and there's no ending in sight, Anderson attempts two audacious narrative tricks to act as half-baked resolutions. The first is a song, which each character, at their own crisis point, sings along with. It's hard to describe. It's as if the entire film was a super-long prologue to a Tori Amos video or something. It's a bit embarrassing. The second trick is probably the only redeeming thing in the movie and since most of you will go see this mess anyway based on the strength of BOOGIE NIGHTS, I won't reveal it. It's quite imaginative and original, but worth the three-hour set-up? Hell no. Why can't these guys make a movie with some high stakes and a few compelling situations and characters? Is that not "cool" anymore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PTA's follow-up to Boogie solid but sprawling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stylish, virtually epic, and synchronistically informed ensemble piece, Magnolia is surely one of the most challenging films of 1999. Unfortunately, the picture's extreme length and handful of unnecessary side-trips prevent it from attaining the levels of transcendence reached by other recent works (American Beauty and The Straight Story, for example) tackling similar thematic terrain -- morals and responsibilities, life disappointments, family relationships, and the need for love. Employing (it would seem) a dozen or so of the cast members from the superior Boogie Nights, Anderson adds Tom Cruise to the mix in a turn that unquestionably represents the actor's finest work to date. Regardless of its shortcomings (the entire section with kid genius Stanley, played by Jeremy Blackman, felt entirely too much like Little Man Tate), a number of the film's risks -- including a most unexpected kind of rain and the tour-de-force montage employing Aimee Mann's "Wise Up" -- pay off with dazzling results.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia (1999): Dir: Paul Thomas Anderson / Cast: Phillip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman: Frogs rain from the sky underlining the theme of unexplained occurrences. The dictionary describes the title as "a species of tree bearing large perfume flowers." That can symbolize life and flourishing relationships. Opening titles gives way to that image symbolizing the burdens that will fade to happiness. Screenplay follows several parallel stories. Philip Baker Hall plays a game show host of 33 years who has cancer. He must confess illegal sexual conduct and seek forgiveness. William H. Macy was a big game show winner in 1968 until he was struck by lightning. Now he drowns his sorrows in alcohol reflecting his one high point as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. Tom Cruise coaches males on T.V. to defend their manhood while an interviewer attempts to unlock his past. Julianne Moore plays a wife whose husband lay on his death bed and she reflects on guilt and regret. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a male nurse helping a bed ridden patient locate his son. Remarkable work by director Paul Thomas Anderson and a great followup to his other masterpiece Boogie Nights, which also contained several subplots and an ensemble cast. As the past halts and the present gives way to uncertainty, frogs shower down pausing conflict and encouraging reflection. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie, don't get me wrong. But at the same time it's hard for me to explain why. The acting was good, and the story was very clever, but when asked what my favorite thing about the movie was, I'm kind of hard pressed for an answer. Well the movie is really a character study so let's look at the characters. Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) and Officer Jim Kurring (John C Reilly) are my favorites. Stanley is a child prodigy on the quiz show "What Do Kids Know?" hosted by Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who is dying of cancer. Jimmy's daughter Claudia Wilson (Melora Walters) is a mess and hateful of her father. When Jim meets her, he is attracted to her at once, and wishes to help her. Meanwhile Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) a former producer of the show is also dying from cancer, and his wife Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is making amends, while Earl's nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is trying to reach Earl's estranged motivational speaker son Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise). It's kind of like a parallel of Jimmy and Earl's struggles with cancer while also looking at the lives of those around them. I say go check it out. It's an interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing but ambitious to a fault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the follow-up to his 1997 breakthrough "Boogie Nights", Paul Thomas Anderson tackled an even more challenging project in the form of "Magnolia". Again working with a large cast and an intricate script, Anderson created another memorable film, though perhaps one that was too ambitious for its own good.The story is not the sort that can be described in a sentence or two. The extended cast of characters is interconnected, more obviously in some cases than in others. There are recurring themes of coincidence, love, forgiveness &amp; death (to name just the main themes).Luckily, the movie's somewhat unwieldy combination of plots is kept under control by skillful editing and the considerable talents of the cast. Tom Cruise may have gotten most of the attention for his admittedly impressive performance but the rest of the cast is equally notable. Excellent work from Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman &amp; Melora Walters makes this a veritable master class in acting. The movie is also notable as the final film of two-time Oscar winner Jason Robards.Meanwhile, Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is adroitly handled throughout the more than three hour runtime. While not as flashy as "Boogie Nights", a fine balance is struck between visual artistry and pacing. Soundtrack selections are likewise somewhat sparingly utilized but all the more effective the few times that they are showcased. Overall, the production values are top notch.Ultimately, "Magnolia" makes for an eminently interesting three hour journey, though I'm not convinced that the plot holds together as successfully as it should. In particular, the surprise denouement seems contrived to me. Nevertheless, the movie is well worth watching for the stellar performances and the considerable craft behind the movie's construction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PTA's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia, director/writer/producer Paul Thomas Anderson's third feature film definitely exhibits all of his strengths as a filmmaker and is a great production overall. The best part for me was the music (the score is by Jon Brion but there are also original songs by Aimee Mann) which is fantastic. The score really heats up during the middle act during the best sequence of the film while the game show "What do Kids Know" is airing, with restless strings and great woodwind scoring. The Aimee Mann songs are also wonderful and play off of the score well. The story follows numerous characters who are all connected by the aforementioned game show. The characters are well written and this shows in the tense middle act that builds up towards them crashing into each other. Tom Cruise's character was my favorite and his performance is fantastic. However, this film was nearly ruined in my opinion by PTA trying to hard when during the final act when all of the characters are shown singing the exact same song and later it starts raining frogs. This wrenches the viewer out of the great story and reminds them that they are watching a movie. I see why a disaster needed to happen, but why couldn't PTA have used, I don't know, an earthquake that would have kept the film grounded in the drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with most films the way you are affected by this film and perceive it correspond with the what you are already familiar with; certain pieces of literature, life experiences, etc. If I had not been exposed to other films that employ underlying details and hints in their narratives this might have impacted me in a larger way. The performances are well executed as one would expect from an ensemble cast (Moore's performance seemed odd at times, but I felt it might have been interpreted this way to add to the pathetic qualities of her character). This film is memorable in its own right, but as far the references in the film I was a bit disappointed that they didn't lead any further than being just that: references. They hint at events that happen later in the film, but maybe I expected there to be maybe a secret narrative to the film because of these. In the ends they seemed to be nods to other works which happens in most films. Perhaps I wish they would have had more of a point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this is another interconnecting story film but this one did something else entirely at the same time. The thing I find funny about this film is that I can't explain what happens in this long epic of a movie it can literally be only be experienced.Things I can tell you is that the film is extremely compelling. The actors and writing that progresses this story of extreme coincidence did an excellent job. I will say that my only complaint is that the film is 188 minutes long but then again I also liked how it's so long. Many people will and have enjoyed this film and to many also considered one of the best and I won't disagree with them.The story as I already stated is really crazy and great to experience. I can't describe everything I got from this film but then again that is part of the experience that you need to see for yourself. Don't worry this film is definitely worth a watch. This film is for a little bit of everybody but keep in mind it's a little different. If you disagree it's probably part my fault because I can't describe a lot in this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would start saying that I don't mind long movies, on the contrary, if they can keep my eyes locked to the screen the longer they are the better is. But with Magnolia I couldn't feel any sympathy with most of the characters so I struggled till the end. I had to force myself to keep watching and it almost never happens to me, really. The middle hour seemed as long as the whole afternoon and I kept checking on the time 'cause I only wanted it to finish. It feels like you expect something to happen, you wait and wait and wait and it doesn't. The movie starts well, but then it becomes too slow and boring with a few interesting scenes that keep you awake, basically the ones with Cruise and Reilly. Awesome acting by Julianne Moore and Melora Walters. Good ending though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. There are movies that are good, some are fun and some on the verge of greatness. This movie really has achieved what many can not do. It is almost flawless.Set in LA, the feature film tells the stories of several people interconnected with each other. There is the lonely cop Jim (John C. Reilly), a junkie on drugs and desperate woman (Melora Walters), who is the daughter of the famous host of a quiz show (Philip Baker Hall), his wife (Melinda Dillon), the participants of this show (Jeremy Blackman and William H. Macy), a producer on the verge of dying of that same show (Jason Robards), his second wife (Julianne Moore), his lost son (Tom Cruise) and his doctor (Philip Seymour Hofmann).This film contains amazing performances. Each has at least one prominent scene and together they create a human drama of great passion.The most surprising thing here is Tom Cruise (very underrated actor in my opinion) that easily gives the best performance of his entire career.Besides the actors, the film is impeccably directed. Paul Thomas Anderson had total control being responsible not only for the direction but also for the screenplay.Magnolia is a movie with a lot of anger, People here are abused, drugged, in pain, clueless, fighting for their lives, trying to find their way of being confronted with unexpected events. they are all in a desperate search for love.You could say that Anderson is relentless. In most of the film, we are faced with a lot of despair and pain. But only at the end, we feel that there is hope for all of them, That despite their mistakes and their failures, they all can be forgiven. My vote is 9Title (Portugal) - "Magnolia"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In one word: ambitious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is probably one of those movies that you never expect to see, and know that you will never see again. Apparently PTA got a free pass from the studio after Boogie Nights to pretty much make whatever he wanted, and man did he shoot for the fences. The camera-work and cinematography in this film is top notch. Film connoisseurs will particularly enjoy some of his extremely long tracking shots, such as the shot leading up to the quiz show. What makes these scenes effective is, despite how long they are, there is a lot of dialog and character interactions happening. Which brings me to my next point.The characters and acting in this movie are amazing. Every. Single. Actor. in this movie brought their A game, which leads to amazing moments of tension, tenderness, and even disgust. Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, and Phillip Baker Hall are the highlights in the movie. Any of those four were deserving of acting awards for their roles in this movie. That does not take away from very solid performances by John C. Reilly and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. But it isn't just the fact that these are great actors and actresses; the characters they portray are incredibly diverse. Over the course of the film, the viewer is constantly finding out new pieces of information that shed light on a character's motivations and actions. This is one of the few movies where in most cases my opinions and feelings about certain characters changed drastically from scene to scene.The soundtrack for this movie is also worth mentioning. Some of the more emotional scenes in this movie are supplemented very effectively with an excellent score. The example that comes to my mind the quickest is the climax of the quiz show What Do Kids Know?. The score "Jimmy's Breakdown" silently building in the background as Phillip Baker Hall tries to fight off physical exhaustion to host the show is possibly one of the most emotionally powerful moments I have ever seen in a film.The actual story itself is so unique and interweaves between characters so well that I won't say anything other than I guarantee it is entirely original. You will not have heard this story before or seen it successfully duplicated since.Now, are there problems with the movie? I think there are a couple. One is minor, the other is somewhat large. The minor problem I had was with the characters all singing the pop song near the middle of the film. I personally think its kinda cheesy and out of place, but I can easily overlook it. The big problem is with the frogs. I don't personally think it was a great climax to the movie, and I think that it doesn't gel with the otherwise solid and well-written storytelling up to that point. Some of my friends have no problem with it, so I may be in the minority with that gripe.Despite a few problems Magnolia is an overwhelmingly good film. A fair warning to the casual movie goer: I believe this movie's primary purpose is not to entertain, it is to make you think. This is not some generic movie to put on in the background and occasionally glance at every five or ten minutes. This a film you allot three hours of your day so that you can give it your undivided attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's third feature, Magnolia, is to date his longest and his most obviously personal film. Featuring another A-list ensemble with the usual players-Julianne Moore, Bill Macy, John C Reilly-Magnolia is a three hour epic concerned with the consequences of upbringing, coincidence and human suffering. That is not to say it's entirely bleak. Though Magnolia's subject matter is heavy, it features the most sincere sequence in PTA's filmography. If you appreciate PT Anderson's cinematic output, it is not a film to be missed. Iconic steadicam, dense characterization and a resonant soundtrack are only a few distinct features of this sprawling feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before today, I had seen this film only once, in a cinema when it was released. Over the past fifteen years, I seem to have developed very fond recollections of what was in it--so much so that I rented the film to watch again today. I wanted to enjoy again what I recalled was a terrific film.And then I saw my original IMDb rating: 5/10. What was I thinking back then? I believe that there is so very much in this film, that it is nearly impossible to fully appreciate the film in a single viewing. There are so many ideas in the film that provoke further thought. I think this film was so far advanced from the usual mainstream movie that the traditional process of a viewer finding things in the film to relate to his or her "real life" was reversed: since first seeing the film, I have found so many things in my own life that I can relate to the events in Magnolia.The Oscar nominations: Tom Cruise, screenplay, song. Won zero Oscars. I can't explain that. Except to say that in 1999, I was wrong to rate the film only as 5/10. I can only assume that the Academy was equally mistaken.</fullReview>

It is a movie in which the story line need not revolve around a straight forward movie set up - with the usual beginning, middle and end, yet intertwines and interweaves with itself.This is a rare chance to see a movie that doesn't rely solely on special effects, or plot twists. It is simply a film for being a films sake.10/10 Exciting, mysterious, a perfect movie experience.A must not miss for any Film lover, placing itself up with the greats and classics such as The Godfather and The Shawshank.

		<shortDescription>Pretentious......but not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed this. There are 11 principle characters in this mosaic of intertwining lives in Magnolia Drive in Los Angeles. The action takes place during one day in the lives of these people. From the inadequate catholic cop (John C. Reilly), to the over powering sex instructor (Tom Cruise), all of the cast of Magnolia are really great. Tom Cruise is the stand out however----he almost levitates into the stratosphere as he struts his stuff. The stories are not happy ones....the dying Philip Baker Hall (who "cant remember" if he molested his daughter)...the dying Jason Robards...the junkie Melora Waltons...the tormented boy genius Jeremy Blackman...the even MORE tormented "old" boy genius William H. Macy ...the mentally unstable Jullianne Moore ...the confused male nurse Philip Seymour Hoffman...the boy geniuses abusive father Michael Bowen. There is almost no humor here at all. It is well done (profesional) but there are reasons why it was not any where near a box office success. When all the characters start singing--each in his own-- way (and ON his own) the movie strays dangerously near the label "Pretentious". The heavy shower of frogs was another leap towards the pretentiousness that the director was probably trying to avoid. I know a lot of people have been trying to "analyze" this movie. That surprises me---because its all very simple. Its all there before your eyes. I think its far too dark----too humorless. In the final analyses it IS pretentious, but its not a bad movie. Its really quite interesting at times. Warning !! If you LOVE frogs you may be upset during this movie.(If you are French...you may become hungry.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like each one of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson's other films, I found Magnolia to be excessively long, desperately wordy, hopelessly plodding and wholly hypnotic. Anderson's developed an innate talent for crafting versatile, flawed, joylessly realistic characters facing the end of their rope, and in that regard this might just be his best work. While the author's deliberate pace is admittedly a major hurdle, it also allows him to explore his cast to an intimate degree that's untouched by his contemporaries. His characters seem so resistant to forward momentum, in fact, that the eventual arrival of major plot developments often caught me completely by surprise, like being stabbed in the heart by a sloth. Though Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and William H. Macy deliver the most rewarding performances, this is really an ensemble piece that would fall flat without the presence of an equally powerful supporting cast. A terrific exercise in characterization, it's tragically narcoleptic at times.</fullReview>

Despite many sleazy and unlikable characters, it has clever currents running through it.Still, the ending degraded it for me. A movie that's ostensibly about real-life coincidences (urban legends aside) should not have to delve into the supernatural.Of course I'm referring to the frogs that rain from the sky in vast numbers, defying logic beyond the realm of coincidence. Where would so many (millions?) exist to be drawn up by a single storm? True animal-rain incidents are on a much smaller scale. Also, frogs in general are vanishing as their environment gets degraded (search for "disappearing frogs").I would have given Magnolia an 8 were it not for that scene taking it into supernatural/Biblical territory. They could have kept the amphibian body-count realistic and had the same effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting characters more-or-less make up for its oddities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is an interesting oddity. It is one of the few films I've see that I liked enough throughout that I was willing to more-or-less forgive the way it fell apart at the end.The movie tells the stories of a bunch of loosely-connected people, including a dying man, an ex-whiz kid, a current whiz kid and a master of seduction. These people are intriguing, rich, full, multi-layered characters, and their stories are told with subtlety and intelligence.Performances are excellent, especially Tom Cruise as the professional pick up artist. I actually watched the movie after seeing a couple of outtakes on Youtube of Cruise leading a seminar (these are quite funny, and represent a case in which a lot of the best bits of the movie wound up on the cutting room floor, perhaps justifiably, as they could have overwhelmed the movie as a whole).Unfortunately, P.T. Anderson apparently didn't feel all that was enough. He begins a movie with a series of anecdotes about coincidence, leading viewers to assume that the movie will end with something that connects these threads, but instead the movie just drifts towards the end, with an poorly conceived musical number and an ending that is in no way properly set up by the beginning, or by anything else in the movie.And yet, over all I found this pretty entertaining. It could have been a great movie - I think a script doctor probably could have turned the script as it was filmed into a great movie pretty easily - but it is still quite enjoyable throughout, in spite of vagaries in tone and some real huh? moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is the kind of film that you overhear people talking about with great enthusiasm in crowded movie-rental stores or semi-trendy coffee-shops. This is no doubt because it has everything anybody would want from a film. It has comedy, drama, intrigue, whimsy, tragedy and action. Magnolia is also very well cast. All of the recognisable stars outperform one another in turn with their roles, and help to create believable and interesting characters in a world that is indistinguishable from our own. The cinematography is at times bordering on perfection, holding a shot on an actor's face as they come to a staggering realisation or erupt into tears. There are many scenes where you almost forget you're watching a film, as you begin to feel the roller-coaster of emotions with each character. In this film there are no protagonists per se, there are only ordinary people dealing with what life throws at them. It's enjoyable and interesting to watch. However, the film is, in my opinion, not without its flaws. There are numerous parts of the film where the scene changes quite abruptly from one character's situation to another, which left me feeling like there was no chance to really get to know each of the different lead characters that were being portrayed. If you're a fan of films which portray human emotion but not of long scenes which explain every nuance of the lead characters you'll surely love this film. if you're a fan of bizarre coincidences and interesting trivia you'll no doubt enjoy this film. If you enjoy watching films with mainstream actors and you'd like to see Tom Cruise cry, you'll love this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's certainly very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique experience, emphasis on experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is definitely a polarizing film. Weighing in at over three hours, it isn't for the timid of spirit, and certainly isn't for the impatient. It is essentially a character study, and an incredibly ambitious one at that. We follow a cast of upwards of ten characters as they simply live their lives over the course of a day. But the characters here are certainly varied and, for the most part, highly watchable. Two of our very best character actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy, deliver excellent performances, the latter most especially as a boy prodigy gone wrong. This is paralleled by a current boy prodigy on the same game show that Macy won on, who is afraid of becoming something similar to Macy's character, said show's host is dying of cancer in a manner similar to the show's producer....and so on. The gimmick that magnolia wields is the sometimes incredulous convergence of chance. It's incredibly intriguing introduction sets the tone perfectly, as it describes three extremely improbable events (which seem real, and I had assumed they were until checking on them), and the film wraps up in the same theme with the oft mentioned "scene" (so called to avoid spoilers). Ebert described it as such: "All of these threads converge, in one way or another, upon an event there is no way for the audience to anticipate. This event is not "cheating," as some critics have argued, because the prologue fully prepares the way for it, as do some subtle references to Exodus. It works like the hand of God, reminding us of the absurdity of daring to plan. And yet plan we must, because we are human, and because sometimes our plans work out." The "event" for me, was certainly unexpected (and undoubtedly memorable), but didn't serve to elevate the events of the film into the same area as the events described in the introduction. What was more striking was the emotion constantly experienced between the characters, and by the characters. William H. Macy is brilliant and pathetic as someone who had such a bright future, but ended up lost and lonely, to the extent that he believes wearing braces could turn his love life around. Tom Cruise is unexpectedly stellar, and his interaction with his father was powerful stuff. Jason Robards' speech about his life's regret stuck with me the moment he finished it. John C. Reilly is perhaps the standout star, playing a simple, utterly boring man, who accidentally, more than anything, affects one of the characters in a way that would seem almost impossible at the start of the film. It is all this, the constant experiences we go through with these characters over the course of the film, that are the real meat of it. The "event", as the character Stanley put it, is just "something that happens." That being said, the film is not perfect. Watching it, one gets the sense that it is somehow flawed, but in a way that one can't quite put their finger on. Julianne Moore's character could potentially have been completely jettisoned. A bit more of it could possibly have hit the cutting room floor, but even at three hours plus, it never truly feels like it is dragging on. Credit Anderson's vision for this. He has created something broad and sweeping, and while it doesn't really have anything important to say, the experience it delivers is at the worst hard to look away from, and at its best enthralling. Perhaps the worst that can be said about it, is that it plays to a very small audience. Whether or not this is actually a debit could very well be debated, but regardless it seems true. I would recommend the film with some slight hesitations. It is definitely challenging fare, but for those willing to brave the journey, it is rather rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this as a first date movie the day it came out. She hated it, I loved it, the relationship was doomed before it even started. Yes we all know Short Cuts was a big influence. Demme and Scorsese are also big influences for Anderson as a director. That being said, P.T. Anderson has become a master director in his own right and his follow up to Boogie Nights could not have been more perfect.The story and sub-plots are too complex to sum up. I will just say that every story line had me hooked. The character development in the writing is one to be marveled at. The entire cast was spectacular and Tom Cruise gave one of the best performances of his life, possibly the best.It is hard to recommend this to everyone. Some people actually HATE this film, while others like me can watch it over and over and never get tired of it.If you are looking for a film with beautiful camera work, direction and acting...AND... a story with substance then this is for you! If you want the big predictable Hollywood movies where you feel safe then I would not recommend it.I give it a 10 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe not... You know, I needed to take my own advice from my "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" review for this one, and appreciate the fact that the acting was outstanding, even though I loathed each and every character, except for Phil, the male nurse. I wanted to powerhouse Julianne Moore in the face and kick Tom Cruise in his "empowered" groinal area. But, despite all that, I was caught up in the multiple story lines, feeling a lot like a moth in a spider web. This is more art than movie, in that, most people go to movies to escape the real world for a while, not get caught up in it like a moth in a-- oh, I said that already. But I call it art because it does stimulate emotional response - which doesn't have to be a happy response. Is it refreshing in its ugliness? I don't know if refreshing is the right word. In fact, some of the characters' problems are things we've seen a million times, and we can welcome all the characters to the ranks of millions who've had a**holes for fathers. On the other hand, there was no holding back in the characters' emotional responses to the effects of what their fathers did.Best performance goes to Philip S. Hoffman, definitely. He usually plays such a creep, so it was refreshing that in this film, he's about the only person who isn't one.I do think it's a little distracting that there's such a trend, in the past few years, for actors to take on new projects in "troupe" format, as in, so many of the same actors reappearing together in each new film. I think it usually works great for Christopher Guest, but when it comes to serious, tragic stories like this one, it does distract from the story line since I find myself looking for each performer. Oh yeah, there's Julianne Moore. Oh, there's Luis Guzman - hey, where's Don Cheadle? etc. That's just a personal thing, though. I did like "Boogie Nights" better but that's because it gave me lots of laughs to break up the clouds of depression that "Magnolia" just sort of dumped on my head like a sudden downpour of...frogs? But judging from most of the other reviews, if you don't mind the heavy-handed ugliness of human fallibility, you will appreciate the performances and really like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed 'Magnolia' blossoms nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that 'Magnolia' is one of the riskiest films ever made. Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan epic about two families dealing with love and loss in modern-day California is full of thousands of weird, wild concepts. Some of these fall horribly flat, , but when Anderson gets it right, boy does he get it right. This film's strongest attribute is its impeccable cast. Underrated actors such as John C. Reilly (as a cop in love), Melora Waters (as his junkie muse), and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as a kind nurse) turn in superb performances, while heavyweights such as Julianne Moore (as a money-minded, Anna Nicole Smith-esquire wife) and William H. Macy (as a sexually confused former television star) do excellent work as well. Two oldie-but-goodies, the late Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall, join the cast as two dying men taking stock of their sins. But the film's most incredible performance is that of Tom Cruise, who plays Frank TJ Mackey, a rude, lewd horndog of a man who runs "Seduce and Destroy" seminars for other rude, lewd men. Cruise electrifies every second he is on screen, whether he is verbally tearing into a female interviewer or breaking down at his father's bedside. How did he ever lose that Oscar? The cast deserves a standing ovation, but this 3-hour behemoth would be nothing if not set to Aimee Mann's ballads, photographed boldly by Robert Elswit, and edited skillfully by Dylan Tichenor. But, as I said earlier, 'Magnolia' is not without its flaws. Subplots about a current child star (Jeremy Blackman) and a homeless rapper (Emannuel Johnson) add unnecessary fat to a lean, brisk film (it speeds by even as it pushes the 180-minute mark), and the now-notorious "frogs" finale ruins the mood of an otherwise brilliant film. Overall, worth your time, if not just to marvel at how Anderson pulled the darn thing off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing on the DVD cover that the movie has been nominated for 3 Academy Awards, I was expecting a lot from it, but felt disappointed. I've never been keen on hearing bad language in films and this one has an excessive amount of it - I think the point could have been made with much less use of the f-word. The characters seemed to play well but I didn't like the character Tom Cruise played, nonetheless, the character did show some depth and growth from beginning to end, as did many of the other characters. This may be a film where, at the end, I might ask myself what I've learned from it and how I can apply it in my everyday life. As for some of the strange events in the film, especially towards the end, I have to say that it was a discredit to the plot and was just too way out. This is probably not a film for everyone and it wasn't really the film for me. Still, I didn't fall asleep or turn off the film during it's 3 hour run, but I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My jaw hit the floor with the force of a wrecking ball...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For three hours and a bit this film. The amazing P.T Anderson hit Magnolia captivated me from start to finish. It used the fantastic technique of jigsaw puzzling the plot, and skipping back and forth from each person(s) situations and then merged them at the finish, they were linked in a mad way, and the whole film is quite imaginative and simple to get to grips with. It is miraculous, set off in documentary style, spiralling into a taut drama, turning into fantasy and ending in sheer sadness, with a hint of revelation and happiness at the end as someone in the current state of affairs finds something to smile about... love. The film has a star-studded cast of many good talents, and some who I generally thought were not good enough to hold their own in front of a camera, but they do. And they also support their acting sidekicks with extreme prestige. For instance... Tom Cruise stars as Frank T.J. Mackey, the long lost son of Earl Partridge, his rich dying father who he hates... and unlike his earlier performances (in which he was generally acted off the stage by bigger better actors) Tom actually puts heart into his acting, and proves he has talent. His acting may reflect the tragedies he has faced in his real life, and if so, then it worked because he has definite integrity in this part, and has also a lot of pride to gain from this film. Julianne Moore also shows some acting metal as Partridge's young adulterous and generally uncaring wife, who feels guilty she didn't do better for him as he's dying and she tries to redeem herself by loving him for his last breaths. These two established some mark on the film industry when they starred in this magical film, and support from other actors (who I thought were competent and promising talents before they starred in this) include: Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H Macy, John C Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon and Jason Robards. P.T Anderson is also superb at the helm, he proved his expertise in Boogie Nights and made an even bigger statement with this, his jigsaw technique and unique shots and storyline make this an absolute gem, with critical acclaim throughout it's distribution range, and with more than enough intrigue to keep me glued for over three hours makes this film a true, all time classic and a memorable film to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights) this is a very interesting drama with several interrelated characters in search for happiness, forgiveness and meaning, all in 24 hours. Oh, by the way, the title I thought was about the flower or colour, but it is reference to both the LA Blvd and similar to the term Charles Font, about where things falling from the sky come from. Anyway, the stories (all somehow connected) include: Frank T.J. Mackey (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Cruise) is the successful motivational speaker with giving the aggressive seminar on dating called "Seduce and Destroy", and he eventually, with the help of male nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) finds his dying (of cancer) father, Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) married Earl for the money, but is struggling to have a normal life, and is resorting to suicide. Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) receives complaints about noise from neighbours, leading to cocaine addicted Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), who he wants a date with. Jimmy Gator (Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall) is estranged from his daughter (Claudia), and he has been hosting popular quiz show "What Do Kids Know?" for over 30 years, but he can't go on with his condition, two weeks left to live. Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) is the brightest of three kids reigning on the show. 'Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) was once a contestant on the show, but has been down on his luck since being struck by lightning. Towards the end, all characters meet the scary fate of a night where, after raining cats and dogs (LOL), it rains frogs! (It can happen) Also starring Melinda Dillon as Rose Gator, Luis Guzman as Luis, Tomorrow Never Dies' Ricky Jay as Burt Ramsey, Evolution's Orlando Jones as Worm, Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina as Solomon Solomon, Henry Gibson as Thurston Howell, Jackie Brown's Michael Bowen as Rick Spector and Miriam Margolyes as Faye Barringer. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for "Save Me" (also nominated the Golden Globe and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have become quite pleased to see Paul Thomas Anderson's films like Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, and Magnolia. Boogie Nights is my favorite out of the three but I have to say that Magnolia is still very good. I love how Paul makes all of his characters important in his films and there is no doubt in saying that there good, because you become in love with his characters and in this movie you do. Following Boogie Nights footsteps with the same characters, I have to say that in this movie, Tom Cruise and John C. Reilly were the best, especially Tom Cruise. His character was really funny and had a nice ego, (alot like Dirk Diggler.) I thought the film was very good but not as good as Punch-Drunk Love and Boogie Nights maybe of the length in the movie, who knows, but still, if you have PT Anderson directing it, it has to be worth watching. So Paul, keep your original idealistic movies coming. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS This film does have many good things going for it and some genuinely touching moments but it overdoes it just a tad. The characterization is first rate, due to the decent script and top notch performances and at times you do really get involved. However at other times you feel that one scene or one character's monologue is never going to end, and eventually you start thinking that about the film itself. The most gripping scenario in Magnolia (how random is that title!) was the nervous cop and druggy woman relationship. Every scene with those two characters was exceptional, and her performance is the most impressive in the film. Tom Cruise is very good, but many will disagree when I say that I think his roles in 'Jerry Maguire' and 'A Few Good Men' were his best. Of course Julianne Moore's performance was great because, basically, it always is. The torrential storm of frogs was totally unexpected but thoroughly intriguing and manages to break the aura of depression quite nicely. But I just do not get this whole coincidence premise. The pre-title coincidences sequence was good but does not really tie in with the rest of the film. I presume the coincidences were supposed to be that all the characters the film focuses on are very loosely interlinked, and there is more than one person in the city with cancer. But these are hardly coincidences are they. You might as well go around spotting coincidences all over the place. For instance, two total strangers broke their legs on exactly the same day and they live in the same city. Wow! Not a particularly effective example but I hope you catch my drift.You really do have to be in the right mood to watch this as it is way long and way depressing but is still fine example of film-making done right. It will probably be a long while before view this again.</fullReview>

As long as it is, one would not want to miss a single second of it and the time is more than well-spent.

It is no less than a daring and ultimately successful attempt at capturing some of the most quintessential facets of human life: fate, love, death and forgiveness. I predict without hesitance, even though I know that the evidence might still be around when I'm long gone: this movie will be considered as one of the most essential cinematic works of our time.

		<fullReview>As a rule, hyped-up self-consciously-arty Hollywood films aren't much good. But Magnolia breaks that rule, along with every other rule in the book.In superficial terms, the film is about a group of people whose lives are connected in various ways. It takes place on a single day in which their lives intertwine and cross over. Unusually, there is no single main character, or even two or three; we end up being equally interested in almost of the eight or nine major characters. They range from an elderly man dying of cancer, to a policeman looking for love, a game show host, a coke-snorting young woman, and a misogynistic motivational speaker for men.The film initially seems fragmented, and slightly confusing. We jump from one character to another with no idea of what the connections are between them. Often, when films start off fast-paced, they become predictable and boring. But Magnolia doesn't do that. Instead, it keeps up the momentum and as the film progresses, you begin to understand the relationships between the different fragments.The actors put in very creditable performances. Tom Cruise is very convincing as traumatised, aggressive misogynist Frank T. J. Mackey. Mackey could easily be a cartoon villain, but Cruise portrays him with depth, even if he does over-act occasionally. Julianne Moore is surprisingly good as the drugged-up, guilt-ridden trophy wife. Her blank-faced style of acting, which doesn't work in all films, is very effective here. John C. Reilly deserves a special mention for his portrayal of nervous cop Jim Kurring. He manages to be somewhat contemptible, sweet, and funny all at once. William H. Macy also puts in a fine performance as quiz kid gone bad, Donnie Smith.There are some truly amazing moments here, in a film that pushes the boundaries of both style and content, without ever being offensive or gratuitous. It shows the harsher side of life without spilling over into 'gritty realism', and is not afraid to have characters who have both good and bad aspects. No cardboard cut-out goodies and baddies here.It is a bit too long, but to be fair it does keep the standard up, and I did see it on TV with lots of ad breaks that made it even longer. A few of the actors are not quite up to scratch ? Alfred Molina's accent is very odd indeed ? but the film can cope with that.The best thing about this film is that it makes you think about the issues it raises, and it raises them implicitly and subtly. Those issues might be described as fate, coincidence, death, love, parents, children, power, drugs, forgiveness, and anger, but to list them like that doesn't do justice to the subtle way the film draws these out.And I'm not going to spoil it, but there is one particular weather-related incident which, in and of itself, makes Magnolia unmissable. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm incredibly shocked at my intrigue over this monumental work. Noting the high mark of IMDB 8, I came prepared to be highly entertained in the normal movie viewing mode. After a long day, it's surprising I decided to tackle three hour's of anything. My initial encounter and the first 25 minutes baffled me and I shut off the machine. Unnecessary strong language saturated my senses combined with Tom Cruise's seemingly way over the top character. Rapid fire downhill slalom of story lines left me spitting with confusion. I wasn't prepared. First rule. Big test the next day, get some sleep. This applies. You can't expect to be a part of this with one eye open. This is graduate school caliber stuff here. Supreme acting, top-flight directing and all around prime movie-making. Starting out fresh the next day, I gave it another try. The movie assuredly lives up to the mark, but through no means of ordinary drama or experience. One must not be prepared for the run of the mill good stuff. Don't be prepared for anything at all. It'll only hurt. P.T. Anderson's direction is impressive and capable and the why behind this wild endeavor abounding with genuine spunk and determination. No one said graduate school is easy, but if you get in and through, it's the type of experience you will look back on after it's all over and appreciate. You'll appreciate this after it's all done. I have the strange urge to thank somebody for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure - if you watch this film with a clinical, hey-that-doesn't-make-sense eye 'Magnolia' will disappoint. However, I don't think that this film is intended to be taken literally - so DON'T! Let this movie engage you on an emotional level and you WILL be satisfied.'Magnolia' is a modern-day parable of how we hide from love and pain and the regret we experience when we do.The cast is uniformly wonderful, with the gorgeous Tom Cruise leading the way with an over-the-top performance as a 'get-some guru' of astounding sleaze and repulsiveness. In the end, however, there is cause for hope that he might end his misogynistic ways.Julianne Moore plays a mentally unstable, prescription-drug junkie who discovers her better nature almost too late. She eats the screen up with anger and frustration, while her huge green eyes shadow bottomless anguish.A fairly unknown young actress, Melora Walters, is convincing in her high-profile role as an (*SPOILER!) incest victim and cocaine addict who latches onto an innocent and too-well-meaning cop (the ever-excellent John C. Reilly.)Melinda Dillon (the classic 80s film "The Christmas Story") has a small but welcome role as the wife of a spiritually bankrupt TV game-show host (Philip Baker Hall) facing his ugly past for the first time and an imminent death from cancer.Although I'm one of William H. Macy's biggest fans, this is not one of his best parts. He plays a former whiz kid who didn't live up to his youthful promise and is now a pee-on at an appliance store. Although Mr. Macy does not have the other-worldly good looks of Mr. Cruise - I do wish he would stop taking roles that have him playing pathetic losers ('Fargo', 'The Cooler', 'Panic'.) Mr. Macy's acting talents are such that he could easily play a strong, attractive character once in a while - and his agent ought to know that.The soundtrack to 'Magnolia' is an eclectic mixture of traditional music and past/present pop that ratchets up the tension and emotion. Warning: get your hankies out!The film has some magical gimmicks that serve it well: characters singing along with the soundtrack and (*SPOILER) a bizarre deluge of bullfrogs that serves as the climax for the story.I believe you will thoroughly enjoy 'Magnolia' if you sit down and prepare for a journey through the darkness of the human heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films that I can say has had a major impact on my non-movie going life (a point I won't even attempt to delve into here). However, after discussing it with many people I now realize that my reaction is not the most common one; I have yet to meet anyone who more that just "liked it OK." I would recommend, though, that anyone who has not seen this film see it alone first, from start to finish. Too many people I've talked to about this film say that they didn't get this scene or that scene. Inevitably I ask them if they saw it from beginning to finish and they always have missed the first few minutes. The problem with seeing it that way is that the stories told in the beginning are absolutely critical to the overall magic of the film. Basically I recommend that it be seen as an uninterrupted whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was emotionally spent for some reason after seeing this movie. I was not prepared. I will say that probably of the movies that came out that year (1999), this has to be one of the best with the best performances I've seen in a long time. I am convinced after seeing the flick, that PT is probably a genius of some kind. He wrote the screenplay in two weeks. Plus, I note that he is one of those directors that recycles his actors!!! Many Boogie Nights alum were present and accounted for. I think Phillip Seymour Hoffman is amazing. And, I am convinced that John C. Reilly is off the charts great. He has been consistently good in everything I have seen him in from The Good Girl to Chicago...even The Perfect Storm. Finally, without question, this is Tom Cruise's finest work and that Oscar nom was duly warranted. This is truly an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Magnolia when it first came out in theatres, and loved it. The depths of the intertwining stories captured my heart. It was a rare movie in which I could dislike the main characters, but still want them to "wise up."The movie now available on DVD (188 minutes) is NOT the same movie that I saw then. It has been re-edited, with many vital scenes deleted. The song "Wise Up" by Aimee Mann is no longer a part of the film at all.It is with great remorse that I recommend you pretend Magnolia no longer exists: it was an ephemeral blossom of light on the silver screen, never to be met again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered that you are all alone on this planet, whenever something goes wrong in your life? Well, this film explains very well that you are not alone. MAGNOLIA takes you into a journey of peoples lives that finally intertwine together making complete sense of where each character belongs in this life.Each character in this film portrays his/her life in a way that makes us realise that no matter how rich or poor we are, or how lucky or unlucky we are, at the end of the day, we all have to deal with the "s***" in our lives - and WE MUST! (that's the learning curve of our life on earth).P T Anderson, has a nack of building tension in each of his film, and he has done it once again in MAGNOLIA. I suggest you also view BOOGIE NIGHTS if you have liked MAGNOLIA.Enjoy - and - "You are not alone".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film of aching and choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I asked myself today if there's anything else I could add that hasn't already been said about this film. It's a film you really have to be in a peculiar mood for. It conveys nasty characters..if they were in your family you'd probably disown them. The way I viewed this film..it features these people at a crossroads in their life. Either continue on their downward spiral into a pit of disaster or cleanse themselves with redemption. There's a fine line between the two and the film shows us that line..every aching moment that is spent walking that thin line. It's a film that conveys people who are holding pain inside that lives in the very depths of their soul. There comes a time when these people must face the pain(and demons)that plague them. The film is obviously much more and has incredible symbolism,but it has such a hardness to it that it can be easy to dislike it. I found it to speak volumes about how things that the past contain can only fester and never leave no matter how much the characters wanted it to. There are people who are kind souls and help the nasty characters at least seek some sort of solace(Phillip Seymore Hoffman and John C. Reilly). The most powerful moment that really got me was the scene where Cruise faces his estranged father(Robards). There's so much agony and hatred..yet also a love that resurfaces as the father is about dead. Robards' unloving wife Julianne Moore and her pains with addiction is another absolute powerful thing to see in this film. Obviously Macy's role has just the right bit of melancholy as does many others in this film. It's a film that has it's detractors..but a film like this isn't easy to digest. Like I said before..it has a hardness and at times it feels like you just want to go into a corner and cry,but the most beautiful thing about this film is the characters face the crossroads and have unexpected visitors..frogs. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depressing stuff like this works best in the theater. Anyone who likes to be entertained by the movies is in for a perplexing evening. Sure the acting is terrific - Tom Cruise at his best and everyone turning in great performances. But it turns me off US society big time to see these self-absorbed, self-destructive, confused, unhappy people presented in all their self-harming stupidity as some kind of reflection of modern life (and death) as we experience it. Is there no spiritual dimension underpinning American lives? None WHATSOEVER? Is that what we non-US citizens are to take from this piece? I thought you guys all go to church every Sunday? This is a real weepie 'cos everyone is either close to tears or in full lachrymose flood! Good grief! The question that puzzles me is: who was willing to put big money behind this script? And why would they? I'm not saying it's a bad movie. A lot of good professional work went into it. But who loved the script enough to say: "We MUST make this picture" ?

		<fullReview>I've always been a lover of off-beat films that follow a large number of characters over a short period of time. Magnolia follows the lives of about a dozen people over a day in San Fernando Valley. The really great thing about this movie is that we get to know each of these characters intimately during the course of the film. As they are faced with decisions we can therefore empathise (or not) with the course of action they choose.The start of the movie is a taste of things to come. As we see a tv quiz show playing and then pan back to see the presenter having sex with a prostitute in a hotel room. This is a taste of things to come and it is not an easy movie to watch at times because it is so real to life.William H Macy is truly amazing as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith as is Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge. These are probably my favourite actors of the moment and they both put in powerful performances. Tom Cruise shows that he can be a fine actor by playing the testosterone charged Frank Mackey. I can't say I'm a great lover of the most unusual scene of the movie, but that apart I think this is an amazing achievement by director Paul Anderson. If you like movies that make you think and take you on an emotional journey then this is for you. The soundtrack (Aimee Mann) is also fantastic. Highly recommended 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a movie fan I had read quite a lot about Magnolia before actually seeing it. Watching a movie that´s 180 minutes long didn´t interest me that much so I decided to wait and see the film when I felt like it. Sometime ago the movie was shown on TV and I got a chance to see whether the movie´s worth all the praises and awards given to it. I missed a few minutes of the movie because I just can´t watch a 180-minute movie without any breaks. Nonetheless, the movie itself was superb. Sure, it was long, but in the end it didn´t actually feel like a long movie. Magnolia is a real character-driven movie with every person somehow related to the big picture. Every cast member deserves nothing but praises as all the characters must have been very hard to play. Julianne Moore especially stands out, I think the scene in which she loses her temper in the drug store is absolutely amazing. She is a very versatile actress capable of doing all kinds of genres. I have never seen her in a better movie! You also get to see Tom Cruise in quite an unusual role. Tom might be considered more a "pretty face" than an actual actor, but in Magnolia he shows what he can do. Magnolia is worth all the hype. It´s an emotional story about people with quite a lot of problems. It´s not a feel-good movie and not the movie to be watched when in need of cheering-up. But when you want to see real film-making at its best Magnolia is the movie to turn to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more masterpiece from PTA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson follows up Boogie Nights with a longer,bigger, more rapidly paced film with even more characters than hisprevious film(many of the same actors from Boogie Nights appearin this film). Set around San Fernando Valley, the film charts an extraordinary24 hours in the lives of the 12 main characters who are all fromdifferent backgrounds, of different ages and with differentsensibilities. Each character is in some way connected to at leasttwo other people either prior to or during the course of the film. This film is absolutely brilliant and proves again what a trulyoriginal and audacious writer/director PTA is. The writing isextremely clever in parts being able to weave around, back andfourth between all the different stories and characters. But ofcourse, a film as big and as complex as this has it's occasionalflaw in the writing (The amount of time Stanley Spector is allowedto waste and then ramble on for on live television before they pullthe show off air and cut to a card is one such flaw). But the endingis a work of genius and comes as a huge surprise. The directing is again, what else could one expect from thisdirector, astonishing. The long, dynamic, well rehearsed takeshelp add to the sense of frantic urgency to some parts and slower,remorseful drawn out moments to others. Only when it looks likeit's turning into a music video with the cast singing along to AimeeMann's `Wise Up' did I feel that it had gone a little too far. The acting is also a joy to watch. With the ensemble cast of mainlycharacter actors you don't feel that anyone is trying to steal the filmfrom anyone else. Tom Cruise's performance as Frank T.J.Mackey a sex guru is a little over rated for my liking. Cruise is IS good, but only as good as the other 12 strong cast. I prefer theperformances of the socially repressed John C. Rielly, the guiltridden Julianne Moore and the kind and quiet Phillip SeymourHoffman myself. The rapid and urgent score by Jon Brion is a very clever addition tothe film helping to hold it all together and make it seem like there'salways more to come and moves along the running time veryquickly. Three hours seems a little indulgent, but there is not one momentor scene that I feel could have been cut and/or shortened to makea better film. The cut is perfect and I never once got bored. Mainlybecause you aren't allowed to get bored with the films manic paceand not to mention how thoroughly entertaining and humorous thewhole thing is.9/10</fullReview>

All credit though to the great Paul-Thomas Anderson who both wrote and directed this masterpiece. The film runs for 188 minutes, but let me tell you, you will never be left bored thanks to P.T.A. The movie is constantly showing what is going on in different places, in different lives, there could be eight different things going on at the same time, you will be left totally immersed in the film. And when the 188th minute passes you will want more. This is a must see movie, another great one from 1999. So go see it today!10/10</fullReview>

In fact all the actors do their jobs perfectly here. Julianne Moore is the woman who develops a conscience as her husband lies dying. After viewing this movie for the first time I was blown away while watching it, but was left feeling ultimately empty as I thought it left out the answers to many of the questions it raised. But that became one of it's plus points. This film stayed in my mind for days, making me think.

		<shortDescription>Script needed polish and refinement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that because I really felt the script needed to be reigned in and narrowed down to a much more concise plot. I understand what the writer/ director's vision was; to make a movie where different stories were interwoven. But, it just didn't gel. I would say my favorite story line was the one with the cop and the junkie. To me that was an interesting enough concept to be a movie on it's own. I also thought a few of the other story lines were cliches: the genius boy being pushed by his dad, The Mysogynistic Guru with parental issues, and the two men dying of cancer( do not mean to cast aspersions on the issue, had a family member succumb to that disease as well). I also thought the opening stories about coincidence, though interesting, belonged in another movie; along with John C Rielly's(Cop) speech at the end; which was also very interesting and moving. The raining frogs bit was also unnecessary and really was done for a reaction other than as an element of the story. Now with that said, I really liked the part where they sang the same song... I found it very touching as well, and was definately something I had not seen before. So, in closing, I understand this movie was inspired by "Short Cuts". I have to say that it lacked the panache of Altman's semi masterpiece. However, if you have seen Altman's "Nashville", you might say that it took Altman two tries to master the story structure that is attempted in "Magnolia". IE Nashville was terrible. Short Cuts was great. So Paul Thomas Anderson would be encouraged to try again. Thank You and good night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson out does himself with Magnolia. Nominated for three Acadamy Awards for Best supporting Actor-Tom Cruise, Best Original Screenplay-Paul Thomas Anderson and Best song-Aimee Mann, Magnolia should have been nominated for a lot more.Before i begin, im going to warn those who have not seen the film yet that i will be discussing a MAJOR SPOILER in the film. once again I warn you, SPOILERS WILL BE DISCUSSED.The story in a nutshell focuses around a day in the lives of 9 people in modern day San Fransisco, all lost and confused, we all can easily relate and feel sympathy for the characters. The cast includes Jason Robards as a dying patriarch, Tom Cruise as Frank TJ Mackey, his estranged son, a sleazy womanizer who runs a seminar on how to use women. His golddigging Wife played by Julianne Moore, his male nurse(Philip Seymour Hoffman) who promises to find his son, a police officer(John C. Reilly), a cocaine addict, former game show contestant(William H. Macy) as well as a few i probibly forgot. Each of these people are at a crossroads in their life where they are unable to do anything without a little help from The Powers that Be.The film opens with three stories of chance and of coincedence, or so we are told. three amazing stories where if we saw something like that in a movie we would say that we wouldent believe it. but as the narrator stipulates, its not chance, things like this happen all the time. that is the basic theme and message. There is no such thing as chance, we all relate and meet for a reason beyond that. These three stories are presented as true but in reality, are false. In the same way, chance did not bring these 9 lives together but something higher up did.SPOILER ALERT in the end, when the act of divine intervention occurs and thousands of frogs pour from the sky, we are left a bit confused. And as said by the narrator in the beginning about the three amazing stories of "chance", "if this were in a movie i wouldent believe it to be true." but what we dont realize is that the end IS true. there have been several accounts, both historically and Biblically where frogs fall from the sky. The film even hints off to the book of Exodus. Historically, there have been accounts where frogs have fallen from the sky after a tornado or hurricane. But remember "if i saw this in a movie, i wouldent believe it to be true." but we believed the three ficticious stories of chance dident we?Another explanation for the frogs(there are many) is that in ancient civilizations, frogs were used to judge the health of society. what better way to show just how healthy these people are than by a downpour of thousands of frogs.But the main message i feel Anderson was trying to get accross is that we all reach a point in our lives where we are unable to help ourselves, and we need a little help from The Powers that Be. This is where Divine Intervention comes into play. in short, God goes to extreme lengths to redeem you.The movie is beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing(who doesent LOVE Aimee Mann) and the climax brings cold shivers down your spine. Although its not for everyone, I certainly reccomend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully intertwined multiple stories...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 9/1/2003 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Paul Thomas Anderson): Wonderfully intertwined multiple stories that all seem to work themselves back together into one big mix of life&amp;death. This is the first time I've seen anything by P.T. Anderson and I'm hooked. He does amazing things with his storytelling while using music to set the tone of each piece. It will be difficult in one viewing to piece everything together but here goes for my memories. Tom Cruise plays a male sex-salesman(since I don't know what else to call him) who looks at things very one-minded until he's confronted by an interviewer about his true past and his father that is on his death-bed. He basically up to this point had lied about his upbringing and no-one knew his father was still alive. Then, there is another story about a talk-show host who has cancer who's daughter is starting a relationship with a policeman after having so many botched relationships and being high on cocaine through much of her existence but the good guy cop is trying to turn her around. There are the kid talk show contestants with overbearing parents, there is a former kid quiz winner who can't handle his current life. All of these stories and more that I can't remember now all get tied together somehow until near the end we have a modern-day `Plague of the Frogs' that stops everyone in their tracks and brings about the conclusion of the movie. Where did that come from? I'm not sure, but I definetly want to view this movie again to figure out everything and how they're all tied together. All in all, the movie is about life, death, what's worth it, and what is not. The point is also made over and over again that situations do not happen just by chance and that we're are all woven together for a reason. Anderson has got to be the `one of' the best American filmmakers these days. Hopefully he gets a chance to do more in this hype-riddled Hollywood American mainstream before he runs out of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncontrolled Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Paul Thomas Anderson wanted to write something powerful, cathartic and intensely intimate. He succeeded, sort of.What we have here is good film that affects us because of the raw emotions the film maker used as fuel when he wrote the story. The music adds a lot as well. But many scenes that are memorable are offset by other very superficial scenes which little effort has been put into. The reason some of the film works and some of it doesn't is that P.T Anderson cannot control himself when he writes.The film is chaotic, illogical and not very intelligent. But it does contain elements of brilliance, which are probably a result of the film maker's febrile mind. This is the work of a talented teenager writing for adults. I hope that over time P.T evolves into something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films you wait a life time to see. Although "Boogie Nights" enjoyed more financial success, it is in this film that P.T. Anderson really establishes himself as a directorial powerhouse, leaving behind a single character film, and moving into an ensemble piece of epic proportions. This bizarre film, which includes a pseudomusical number, biblical themes, and at the very least some VERY strange weather, moves past it's pretensions and is truly touching. Anderson foreshadows some themes, like loneliness, and being outcast from one's family, that he would later more fully explore in "Punch-Drunk Love" and follows up on the narcissism, and vanity, that he highlighted in "Boogie NIghts." In my opinion this is his finest film, one of the few in cinematic, history where once you sit down, you don't want to leave until it's over. SImply put, it's brilliant. Enjoy</fullReview>

The preview had seemed to promise a well woven tale of an intricate story line. And the beginning moments seem to confirm this. I started off the film with lusty enthusiasm.This initial feeling had paled considerable as the hours dragged on. With the exception of being impressed with a few of the end scenes I left disapointed. But it left me intrigued enough that I watched it again. And again. And each time I've watched it since I've enjoyed it more. Its a film that needs to be viewed in pieces, almost in scenes as each a story of their own rather than something that has been so delicately woven. When you look at it this way--the plot and the characters that are connected take on a dusky subtle importance than make it all together a beautiful to watch film.Some of the performances are mind blowing. Tom Cruise for one is astounding, as well as many others in this brilliant cast list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia had great potential, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something is missing in this film. I've watched it on 3 separate occasions since it came out and each time I've felt the same way; the characters are unique, but a bit too flat considering the complexity of the story. While great performances where turned in by John C. O'Reilly, Phillip S. Hoffman, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Jason Robards, I think Tom Cruise was very mediocre and was nothing more than a caricature and Melora Walters, the coked out daughter of Jimmy Gator, was just plain bad.After watching Adaptation, I felt that, that's the movie Magnolia should've been; just in terms of creating interesting characters and intertwining their disparate lives.I think Anderson has a hell of a lot of talent, Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love were terrific, however, I think he may be a better screenwriter than director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nope, I was NOT a Tom Cruise fan...not until this film.This is an adult film with adult themes. In saying this, many wont like it, many wont understand it and many will call it crap. I find it one of the best films of that genre out there.I gage it this way....back in 1969/1970 "Midnight Cowboy" came out and was rated X for adult themes and situations. By todays standards, its pretty tame, but the idea behind the X rating is what is important. You don't take your kiddies to see this, your teens may not be able to "dive into" it, but if you're an adult who has experienced life and all that surrounds life a bit, then this may hit a chord.(Minor Spoilers?)Paul Thomas Anderson takes us into the lives of several people based in California's San Fernando Valley, from the seemingly affluent, to the down right disgusting. He weaves a story based on "coincidence", how these people not knowing each other, or briefly passing each other, can effect each other's lives...if only for a moment.Hey, it could happen.There are intentionally silly moments, overdrawn moments. Julianne Moore's performance is not over the top, but 'right on' for those in the San Fernando Valley who have reached the end of her rope. She's young, vibrant she marries the rich older man and now he's sick and dying and she can't take it. Her world was FINE until he got sick. The only situation I could have had less of was that of the Policeman and his "girlfriend". I loved her story with her father, and how she ended up. This film has all of the Paul Thomas Anderson regulars and I love them all in their parts with the addition of ... Tom Cruise. He was TOO believable in his part, which is why he got a supporting Oscar nomination. But this film gives Cruise a unique acting range to work with and he does it fine.Pay attention to the first fifteen minutes of the film, the rest will fall in order for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Magnolia and can understand the general enthusiasm for this film but must admit frankly that I was bored. I thought that the individual stories where essentially banal on their own, though I must admit though that they were merely banal and not clichéd. At least they were freshly if somewhat unsurprisingly presented. The much vaunted use of the numbers 8 and 2 was merely a gimmick rather than either a rigorous aesthetic or a skeleton key to the film's meaning. Alright the name "MIM" in roman numerals is the year the film was released but so what. Couldn't understand what some of the actors were saying, especially the rapping black kid, and some of the scenes between actors smelled like improvised workshop things but essentially I was reaching for the remote just before the hour mark. It was one of those 'less-than-meets-the-eye experiences. I was at least expecting to find out that Tom Cruise was gay or at least his character was. I mean the interview explains his hostility to his father but not his hatred of women. Which was the point of his character, drawing out the inherent hatred of women in the men of present day society. The film is set up seriously but not thought out or finely wrought enough. It's not enough to quote crap from other movies if I doesn't have a consequence in this film. They must have loved this film in France, especially the ending. I mean Holy Blue!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is unlike any other Anderson movie; really, it's unlike any other MOVIE out there, period, and a necessary antidote for those of us who feel more and more alienated by modern movies, modern culture, modern life. Since there are already a kazillion reviews of this I won't rehash the plot except to say that it's about one "ordinary" day when all the buried/masked/diverted/denied pain of the world comes welling up, like a dam bursting, refusing to remain unacknowledged any longer. The apocalyptic finale may not make a lick of "sense", but it feels inevitable and right and it plays perfectly. The ensemble cast is so uniformly inspired that it only underscores the stupidity of Oscars and Golden Globes....singling out an outstanding performance here is akin to taking apart a perfectly-calibrated Swiss watch to praise one particular gear. One further point: you hear a lot about Anderson's "audacity" and "ambition" in discussions of MAGNOLIA. It's true but that ambition has less to do with juggling interlocking subplots, and everything to do with the core of this movie: that forgiveness is hard but living without it is impossible, and that even pain has beauty in it because it is authentically FELT. The final image - Claudia's uncertain, frazzled, vulnerable but hopeful smile - is one of the most haunting in movie history, one I hope to carry with me forever. God willing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wise Up to the Beauty of Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five minutes into this film, I was intrigued. A half an hour later, I was obsessed. By the time Magnolia had finished, I was a part of it. Not many movies can draw a viewer in the way Magnolia does. How does director Paul Thomas Anderson do it?: With rapid fire editing and frantic camera work. With stellar performances from today's best actors--Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, and Melora Waters just to name a few. With a soundtrack crafted brilliantly by singer/songwriter Aimee Mann. With a plotline so intense and dialogue so revealing you feel as if you know each character intimately. With fearless plot twists that will drop your jaw. I guess what makes Magnolia so remarkable is that it is unapologetically unique in every way imaginable, yet it draws on the age old dramatic and cinematic tricks that will make it timeless.The only criticism that I can think of is that the ending (which I will not reveal) could have been a bit less jarring. There also could have been a better resolution of the plot. But maybe (well, most likely) this is exactly what PT Anderson wants: an unresolved, bizarre conclusion.See it! You'll either passionately love it or hate it. Either way, you will be impassioned.Rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie should be discussed, that's what makes it interesting. Some people want an easy plot with no difficult interpretations. This isn't such a one. There are many characters and they walk on with dizzying speed. You really must pay attention or you'll lose the story. No potty breaks for sure, and, pop your corn ahead of time. Phillip Baker Hall is simply superb as the grieving father, to say more would be full of spoilers, so I'll just say that he gives a marvelous portrayal of about every emotion required of a great actor. Tom Cruise is superb as well (He is a vastly underrated actor) and you can fell the pain bleeding from his eyes and his every gesture. If I had seen it when I had better luck staying awake, (Three hours eight minutes long and I saw it quite late at night) perhaps I'd have rated it a ten, but it was an eight, owing to its poor sound quality and overall length.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've looked at the message boards and comments for this movie and it has got to be the most provoking movie of a long time. It seems people are just entranced by the movie and LOVE it or think it drags on and just absolutely hate it.I personally thought the movie was really good, but probably the worst of the PT Anderson films. That doesn't mean that the movie is bad, I still think it was amazing, but it just goes to show how good PT Anderson is. The movie is intensely long and I do think that it could have been shortened a bit. But since there was so much material to tackle I can somewhat understand its length. The stories that are woven together come meshed together at the end very cleverly and I am very impressed. Some stories, however, were definitely more interesting than others. I was not too interested by Juliane Moore's story (although she did a great job in the movie), it just did not pique my attention too much. John C. Reilley's story was probably the most interesting of the group. The story about the quiz show host seemed somewhat forced, I thought, and not too interesting. The story of the two quiz show people (william h. macy and the kid) was quite interesting. Tom Cruise's story is somewhere in the middle.I thought the best scenes were the beginning and the very end. I can't spoil so I won't give reasons why. Sorry. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Human Condition Beautifully Brought To Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of those films that you simply adore or despise. There is no in between, and to answer the detractors that protest about the length of this film (3 hours, 6 minutes), the only reply I can give is that sometimes it takes a while to tell a good and solid story, which Magnolia is.The movie takes place over one day in California, telling the stories of nine individuals over the course of that day. The stories slowly interweave into one linear, understandable tale and the performances, particularly Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise (in probably his best role to date, against type as a testosterone-pumped self help guru) are consummate and superlative. I won't reveal any plot details because it would truly spoil the joy of becoming drawn in to this tale.What makes this movie stand out from its contemporaries, in my humble opinion, is the soundtrack. Aimee Mann's songs not only punctuate the plot but they have a life of their own and in songs such as "Wise Up" and "Save Me", the honesty of both the story and the music become apparent.The final nod must go to Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote and directed Magnolia. Where Boogie Nights was more of a modern American fable, Magnolia is realistic and deals with everyday emotions and situations that we all go through and Anderson handles the subject matter with sensitivity and care.All in all, if like me you are able to completely lose yourself in an engaging and enjoyable story, then this movie is highly recommended. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson's "Boogie nights" totally blew me away. It was, is and always will be one of the greatest movies of the last decade. It was like "Goodfellas" of the porno business and more. I mean if Paul Thomas Anderson isn't Martin Scorsese's logical successor I wonder who is! Of course I expected that "Magnolia" would be an equally wonderful masterpiece. Well it definitely was a masterpiece too. "Boogie nights" was still better, though.The opening sequence of "Magnolia" alone proofs that this is not just a film among others, this is something special. The movie takes Robert Altman's 1993 classic "Shorts cuts" and turns it to a whole new levels. The frog rain part gives me the chills, just because it's so bloody well made. William H. Macy was very memorable as well as Philip Baker Hall and John C. Reilly. Basically all the other actors/actresses.Well especially Tom. If there's a one role he should have got the Oscar, it's this one. Long live Tom Cruise. The guy started out in the 1980's from silly teen flicks like "Risky business", "Top gun" and "Cocktail" and just look at where he's now. This man just gets better and better with every film. His role in "Magnolia" is incredible, it's so funny yet heartbreaking to see how Frankie breaks down completely and turns from self-confident anti-hero to that pitiful poor creature. Donate yourself a terrific three hour experience and watch this great and touching piece of fantastic movie entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers ahead:pt anderson's a kid, but he really does know what he's doing. look at how the frame is sometimes static (the first meeting between the cop and the cokehead), sometimes fluid (camera following the current child whiz when he arrives at the studio). he uses techniques to achieve what he wants (the zoom when the cop and cokehead rise to kiss, the unblinking gaze on the seminar leader as the interviewer confronts his lies). he's got a command of film grammar, and he's, what, only at the first third of his life/career?ok. end of compliments.my criticisms are primarily story based. he presents overwrought scenes -- shouting, inarticulate pain, frantic characters -- but he doesn't deserve to. it's the film equivalent of a complete stranger cornering you at a party telling you all about her childhood abuse, drug problems, and current lack of a good emotional partner. all within the first seven minutes of meeting. as I say, nothing wrong with sharing, but timing is critical, especially in movies. you have to deserve the huge payoff. I felt mugged and tricked and cheaply manipulated by this movie.and WTF is up with the rain of frogs? "when in doubt, throw in a biblical plague." he DIDN'T DESERVE it! he didn't deserve to bring in an apocalyptic intimation as a coda. sure sure, defenders may say it was his vision. but the response has to be, his sense of how to tell a story is flawed.he has the tools and skill sets to tell a story extremely well. he just happens to not have the good sense to rein in his extravagance. he has a brilliant movie in him, a world changing, dream defining film. this is not it. do not be swayed by the rabid fans, or pta haters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interaction between characters in Magnolia is of particular note. This is because although only loosely connected, this connection is a key to the film. For example, one of the least thought about connections in the movie is that between Quiz Kid Donnie Smith and Earl Partridge. One can see how a cold hearted T.V. producer would package an idea of using genius kids (one of the first being Donnie Smith) to beat adults in games of intellect for consumption by mass America, despite the negative impacts it would have on said kids. The Jimmy Gator connection only comes in later when a sometimes fun-loving, sometimes calculating game show host is needed. The idea for actually using these kids as fodder was probably not Jimmy's in the first place. Furthermore it is only on Earl's Death Bed that he actually admits that he did things wrong, which, in terms of Karma, may have led to Jimmy heart attack and Stanley's rebellion. T.J. Mackey was also destroyed as a kid by Earl, but in a very different way. T.J. is actually Earl's son, though Earl left T.J. and his dying mother when Mackey was only 13. This completely destroyed Mackey and may have led to escapism in the form of sexual promiscuity. Though we have already learned Earl is on his deathbed and therefor Earl and Mackey must reconcile before Earl dies. There is also the third, slightly more disconnected, story of Jim Kurring and Claudia Wilson Gator. Claudia's father is obviously the most direct, and one of the most important, connections to this storyline. Jim, himself, is literally an isolated figure. He patrols the streets alone, he has no friends, and his family is non-existent. The only connection he does have is to people he meets in his work, such as the child profit Dixon. When he happens upon Donnie Smith he seems to know him, but from where is unknown. Overall this storyline is far more disconnected then the others.  As I had previously mentioned earlier this year, P.T. Anderson seems to progressively disassociate his characters in his first three films (i.e. Hard Eight is a tight knit small group of characters, and then Boogie Nights is more disassociated, but not to the degree that Magnolia is.) Of course this does not hold true for Punch Drunk Love which, in it's shortness, seemed like a cleaning process for Anderson. This is why Magnolia feels like an epic even though it all takes place in the one place, the valley (which in itself is counter-epic). Overall Magnolia is driven by character relations and interactions which, in their high quality, make the film what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when several stories are put together, but at the same time are told separately, in a movie full of stars and talented actors? Answer: Magnolia. I could never say it's a masterpiece although I'm sure it could be. Why isn't it brilliant? Because it's too long (over three hours) and it takes some time until the film gets on its way and pleases the ones who are watching it. The first minutes are confusing and shows no sign of what is to come. However, after about one hour, `Magnolia' gets much better and it seems we are seeing something totally different. The facts take place rapidly and we follow all the stories almost simultaneously. There's a strange atmosphere of affliction when once we are getting involved with one story, another one comes to the screen with no warning. It makes we feel like `What happened there?' Great edition. That's good!!The cast is great! Tom Cruise is in his best and Julianne Moore, always talented and beautiful! The direction by P.T.

		<shortDescription>A Plague Falls on a Blossoming Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's first film, Hard Eight, was an understated, claustrophobic and moody thriller. It was also highly stylised. Some of the same elements can also be seen in Magnolia, his third film, but cut up into pieces and rearranged in a much larger collage. Magnolia is an truly epic film, structured loosely around the terminal diseases of two elderly men. Aided by an excellent ensemble cast, the film sweeps us through an ordinary/extraordinary day in the lives of its characters with humour both wry and black. Stand out performances come from John Reilly as a soft-hearted cop and Tom Cruise as a misogynistic motivational speaker; but no-one really puts a foot wrong.But this is not a conventionally naturalistic film. The characterisation, plot and dialogue all have an air of deliberate contrivance: this gives the film an undoubted style and mood, but at the expense of a certain depth. The characters, for example, though highly original, are also unmistakably emblematic: all seem conceived exactly to fit their purpose, nothing less but also nothing more. The overall impression is almost that an (uncommonly sophisticated) outline or treatment, which could have the effect of emotionally distancing the viewer. Anderson guards against this through skillful use of an intrusive soundtrack, and a perfect sense of judgment in when to cross-cut between the different tales. Magnolia is a highly manipulative film (in the best of senses): the director achieves through artifice what the story alone might fail to accomplish.The real problem with such an ambitious venture is how to find an resonant ending that brings all the themes and plotlines together. And here, sadly, Anderson gets it wrong. His chosen conclusion is over-the-top, unnecessary and (quite literally) falls from the skies. There's a reason why truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, and its even quoted in this film: that there are things you wouldn't believe if they were invented. But film makes this point immediately after ignoring it in practice; which is cool, or complacent, according to your fancy.Nonetheless, watching Magnolia makes for an engrossing three hours, and Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft. When he stops trying so hard, he will surely make a truly great movie.</fullReview>

This film is not recommended for anyone heavily medicated by their doctor or who has their therapist on speed dial. Never before has a three hour movie left you so "shaken" as it weaves its tales of dying fathers, lost sons, crazy wives, abused daughters, incest, homosexuality, perversion, drug addiction, and the pitfalls of fifteen second fame. The melancholy and neurotic songs of Aimee Mann are used as a perfect soundtrack for this self-conscious trip into the human psyche.

		<fullReview>An excellent follow-up to 1997's Boogie Nights, but isn't as good. I would say Magnolia is Paul Thomas Anderson's second best film (out of 4). The story is very complex and you really have to pay attention. Not to mention it is a very LONG movie too. It is three hours and eight minutes! I've seen longer, but that is pretty long. The story really sucks you in though. It is about a lonely cop (John C. Reilly) who is falling in love with coke-addict (Melora Walters), whose father is a big television game show host (Philip Baker Hall - who portrayed Detective Bookman on 'Seinfeld') who is having heart problems, who has the kid genius star on his show (Jeremy Blackman). The other story is about a sick old man who is dying (Jason Robards) and how his young wife (Julianne Moore) and his personal nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) try to get in touch with his only son (Tom Cruise) who is a motivational speaker to sexist men. Another major character in the story is a former quiz show kid (William H. Macy) who is an adult now and reflects on his horrible life as a car salesman and how his parents took his money away from him. This is an excellent film for people looking for an interesting movie and long movie. I recommend this to Paul Thomas Anderson fans too. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched Magnolia when it first came out on DVD, and dismissed it, finding it to be overly long and incredibly boring. Yesterday, I decided to watch it again, and I was simply blown away.Now, I can't say I'm a big P.T. Anderson fan - I didn't care much for Punch-Drunk Love, finding it pretentious and pointless, and I've never seen Boogie Nights - but I must say, Magnolia deserves to be watched and respected by anyone who calls him- or herself a fan of great cinema. The way this movie unfolds, the way it lives and breathes through the viewer, capturing your attention and your emotions, is simply amazing. Every actor and actress in the film delivers incredible performances as their respective characters, especially William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall and Julianne Moore. Not to mention the heartbreaking passion with which Jason Robards delivers his performance.And I must give P.T. Anderson credit for his incredible creativity and for being daring enough to put scenes in his movies which have the potential to bomb horribly (the characters, even the dying Robards, singing along to a song by Aimee Mann; frogs raining from the sky in Los Angeles). However, somehow, none of these scenes bomb; in fact, they seem to complement the movie perfectly, to strangely fit in to this world of uncertainty and catharsis that has been meticulously crafted by Anderson. And when William H. Macy's character, mouth bleeding and teeth broken, turns to John C. Reilly at the end of the movie and says, "I really do have love to give. I just don't know where to put it," while breaking down into tears, one sees Magnolia for the truly great film it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant mosaic of desperation, coming-of-age and self-discovery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia", scripted by the film's director, Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights"), is a complex and very meticulous study of the lives of 10 people during the course of a single day and how their experiences culminate to a shattering climax. There's Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), a whiz-kid whose superhuman intelligence and recurring role on a popular quiz show eventually leads to feelings of inadequacy and disillusionment among his peers; Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is the show's host who is haunted by the past because of incestuous acts he committed against his now adult daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), a washed-up coke addict who sniffs and snorts like there's no tomorrow, all of this unbeknownst to Rose (Melinda Dillon), Jimmy's wife and Claudia's mother; Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise in his Oscar- nominated, Golden Globe-winning role) is an evangelical sex guru who preaches total domination over women; Mackey has severed all ties with his father, Earl (Jason Robards), who is slowly dying and wants to see his son one last time; Julianne Moore is his mentally exhausted wife Linda, who at first married him for his money but who has come to truly appreciate the bedridden man she has taken for granted; Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the effete male nurse who attempts to fulfill Earl's dying wish; Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) is a cop who arrives at Claudia's doorstep by request of angered neighbors and falls in love with the girl, acting almost as if he's unaware that she's a drug user. Finally, there is Quiz Kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), who was once in Stanley's shoes but who now is nothing more than a pathetic petty thief and wallowing souse. This film did not capture my attention at first. With the documentary-style introductory sequences, I thought this would be a waste of time. How wrong I was! If you can get past the constant jumping back-and-forth of the separate stories, you'll see the underlying package is a richly developed character study, full of people rather than caricatures, and emotions rather than theatrics.

		<fullReview>I can't believe how many comments I've seen here just dissing this film, what the hell is wrong with everyone? Some complain that it's too long, unbelievable, it may be long but how can you complain? I didn't find it boring at all, it was very well paced. Also, some complain that it's too complex, well, if you're more used to watching movies like Naked Gun then you're not likely to appreciate anything! I'm not saying this is the best movie ever or anything like that, but it doesn't deserve all this negative criticism. Anyone who truly appreciates good movies should watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film, a bit too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ensemble cast can't get in the way of this collection of intersecting stories, most of which are interesting. I thought the best parts were the ones with the cop and the cokehead girl on a date, and the scene where he loses his gun is also very beautiful (just amazing photography). Jason Robards and Tom Cruise are father and son. Robards is dying, full of regrets and anger he unleashes on Hoffman, his effete male nurse. He exhorts him to find his son, Cruise, a media personality selling sexual preactory techniques through tapes and workshops. This stuff and the parts with Macy as a pathetic ex-quiz show champ, is all excellently acted and written, but unfortunatly some other parts are written too sentimentally.The only thing I didn't like, and some people may like it, is how everyone busted into that terrible song towards the end of the movie. It was just such a bad song, and it took me so much out of the movie just as I was wanting it to end. Anderson is obviously in love with his film images, which is good, but he needs to exercise a bit more wrist action in the cutting room. Cutting the whole song wouldn't have hurt it a bit: I'm no fan of the "realist" style, but I also find this "surrealist" bits kind of distasteful. Often it's as if the directors knew they were making too good a straight movie and they just couldn't see it through, they just had to make it "weird". The Coen brothers also have this problem, which damages some otherwise excellent films (i.e. "The Man Who Wasn't There"). Hopefully, Anderson will improve in these aspects as he goes on in his career, and also take all of us into places we never saw before on the movie screen. He has the potential to be really great, if he can just avoid the errors of becoming overly idiosyncratic and self-centered (like his mostly boring predecessor, R. Altman). Good luck to him in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite all the Hollywood hype......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having been taken in by `American Beauty', there was a certain dosis of scepticism about embarking on this film. Another one of those with lots of roudy razzamatazz and all the big names you could wish for, like Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robard (in the film and in real life dying), Willy Macy, and a long list of etceteras, which are usually enough ingredients in themselves for huge box-office takings, as well as a lot of very high voting on IMDb. Added to that, if we take Murphy's Law into consideration - namely that the longer the Special FX credits list and the longer the Stunts credits list - the worse the film is, as these tend to override any story which may be there to be told; and this film has a lengthy list of participants in both categories. So you will understand why my scepticism was preparing itself psychologically for a brash blunt-bladed knife attack of tabloid-sized blaring headlines purporting to be a film.Not so with `Magnolia': a complicated, or perhaps just intricate, story of various people's mishaps in life, at first seemingly unrelated, like disconnected pieces, but which little by little become joined up as the film progresses. Interpretations were mostly fairly good, though the ever-present American tendency to play over the top left no options for subtlety, no possibility for profound perspectives.However, Paul Thomas Anderson's intelligent way of jumping from one story to another, flashbacks included, was indeed successful, even innovative at times; the logical sequencing was not so erratic as may at first seem.What `Magnolia' really needed was a genuine genius for this kind of thing; it's just that, well, you know, ahem, darest I say? - Almodóvar would have improved this film immensely.One final thing: the music was very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave, original fable about the nature of forgiveness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PT Anderson's Magnolia is a meandering film about love, forgiveness, selfishness, paranoia and introspection. It is very much a movie-lover's movie, so many people will be upset or bored by it, but it does repay repeated viewings and an open mind.The nine stories, all set along LA's Magnolia boulevard, range from a shy, earnest policeman, a coke addict, a game show presenter, a dying man, a nurse, and most memorably Tom Cruise's astonishing TV Sex-Guru Evangelist. Over the course of the film they intertwine - sometimes obviously, sometimes surprisingly - and we are left at the end with one remarkable image of a collection of lives co-dependent. It's rather like driving slowly down a long road, watching the events unfold as you go. Fabulous film-making.The film's climax - the now-famous frog scene - is horrific and bewildering, as it follows the films most brave and cathartic moment. Just before the first frog falls spectacularly from the sky, every charater is shown singing along to aimee mann's terrific pivotal song. The effect is spine-tingling. Wonderful.Many will hate Magnolia for it's indulgent length and drama, plus the apparent lack of redeeming characters. I believe it is one of the most important pieces of film-making in recent years - relying not upon trickery and flash or violence, but an ensemble of terrific actors playing the best roles of their lives. Watch it for Julianne Moore. Watch it for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Watch it for Tom Cruise.Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this over two evenings, pausing just before the game show collapse. I knew the reviews tended to fall in the 'hate it' or 'love it' camps and so was eager to see for myself. Just so I don't get labelled I love all kinds of movies - from action to period drama and almost everything in between - with the simple judgement criteria being 'Am I entertained?'.Magnolia, for me, is magnificent. Although multi-threaded I felt there was (just) enough link to make the story hold, the acting was faultless and regardless of your opinion on the reason behind the frogs (actually I'm fairly certain they were toads anyway) this was a superb moment that has left me thinking about the whole film constantly.I have a couple of minor gripes - mainly the musical score. Not so much the choice of music which is OK if a little disjointed, but more the level of it in the mix. At times I had trouble following some of the dialogue as it was so loud, while at others it seemed as though someone forgot to stop the scene setting incidental soundtrack and just left it running non-stop. Other than that, the story thread of the dead man in the closet appears to wither on the vine - or did I miss something?You don't need to be an 'Arty' to enjoy this, but it will probably reward a second viewing. Sit in a comfy chair, indulge yourself in the film and remember to turn the volume up when you see the Quiz Kid on the drainpipe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A radiant drama which leaves you mentally shattered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled upon this film when it first came out on video and watched it yet didn't think much of it. I rented it about a week ago because I couldn't remember all about it just that, it was high-quality. I think I watched it maybe 5 times in the past week just analyzing every waking moment of all of the lives along with their rage, dissatisfaction, abhorrence of themselves and masking contempt towards others. It could be seen as depressing for some but, it comes across to me as a gorgeous piece of reflection on why people act how they act. 9 main characters, a daring feat for a film, all interlace in tale of one day in a close area of Los Angeles.We have the cop, gasping for love anywhere he can find it and needing to be successful at his job for his own sake. The drug crazed daughter who hides in her apartment wanting nothing to do with her family or even the world. The game show host, the father who tries to connect with his daughter but, he sees she is clearly on drugs and wants nothing to do with him, he also is accepting the consequences of his decisions in life and is on the verge of death. The dying man, he used to be a television producer but, now is on his death bed with cancer and is drifting in and out of existence. The wife, now thinking of her many choices she has made while being married to the dying man and doesn't want his money because she feels horrible about everything she did to him. The male nurse, struggling with his feelings for the dying man and doing all he can to find his long lost son to help him in granting his last wish in life, to see him. The womanizing self-help guru, he makes up a family history to bury his tragic real life family of a mother who died when he was a young teen and a father who abandoned him. The quiz kid who used to be smart but, now sees himself as stupid, having money issues and loving anyone that he thinks he can latch on to, he confuses sickness and love and he doesn't care. Lastly the current quiz kid who is about to beat the record for being on a game show for the longest but, judges himself through his fathers eyes and seeing how people depend on him and think of him.Somehow the director Paul Thomas Anderson made this movie only 3 hours long. Many people have complained that it is too long, they don't realize that their are nine main character and it's hard to explain the whole story in less than that time. P.T. Anderson is constructing modern classics and Magnolia may be his best he will ever make. As your watching the movie, all track of time is lost and, unless your the kind of person that looks at his watch every five minutes during a movie, you won't care. Another criticism of the film is the ending which can be interpreted in many different ways by many different people. I see it as the hand of god purifying all of their lives helping them to attempt changing their lifestyles and current situations. It could be seen as a phenomenon which makes this story a strange situation which is set up by the prologue that this movie was going to be a strange story. In the end it taught me how people can love and live in this crazy and bizarre world.9/10 "It is in the humble opinion of this narrator that strange things happen all the time and so it goes and so it goes. And the book says "We may be through with the past but, the past ain't through with us""</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost the sence of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't believe it had been three hours from the moment I sit down and start watching the movie. There are very few films which actually have a lot of characters, and in a short time (and three hours is short, if they are nine) and are capable of demostrate their feelings, desires, frustrations and day to day problems.The great thing about the movie is that. Is about the day to day, how people like us survive to the city again and again, and live to tell about it. The characters are so real. If you can't relate to one of them, if you hate one and love the other, then you can't sence the flow of time. Personally I was always waiting to see what happened to Linda because I feel inmediately in love with her personality. She is so frustrated because of what she's done, wants to go back in time and make things up, to demostrate her real love for her husband and the desire to be happy with her counscience even if Earl is dead.And the poor Stanley. You could see only with his expression that he gave a damn to the game as long as he could please his dad, or just be happy with it. Tom Cruise's expression during the interview is fantastic, although I'm not sure what he was thinking. Also, when that guy in the glasses sees the bartender in the bar...I think he is the one with less line because his face tells pretty much everything.The acting is great. I haven't understand yet the frogs, but I trust they had some special and deep meaning to high for my intelligence. Totally lovely, even better if you like Julianne Moore as much as I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>P.T. Anderson is a genius in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is the follow up film to Boogie Nights, the Anderson film that was growing in popularity as he decided he better try and do another film right away. He wrote some of it and finally wrote the bulk of it while as William H. Macys cabin house. The reason he did was for a few days he just wrote and wrote because he was scared if he went outside a snake that had previously been seen would bite him. Magnolia is a stroke of genius that provides the question, "How do people think of stories like this?". Magnolia is a large story with about 9 main people involved in it and all connecting at the end. The quirky sometimes off beat John C. Reilly playing Officer Jim Kurring, a cop that wants to perform his duties as a law officer and find love at the same time. The drug infested emotional roller coaster Claudia Wilson Gator played by Melora Walters who wants nothing to do with her parents and does cocaine constantly. The strong yet vulnerable personality of Tom Cruise playing Frank T.J. Mackey, a motivational speaker who preaches his catch phrase about his method in getting women "Seduce and Destroy". The elderly man Earl Partridge played by the late Jason Robards, a stunning portrayal of a dying man with cancer who is struggling in and out of life. His depressed wife Linda Partridge played by the wonderful Julianne Moore who acts with such feeling and pain that its hard to believe she's actually acting as a woman who harbors the pain of death. The male nurse of Earl played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who is named Earl Partridge, he sticks with Earl all the way never wanting to leave or not help him find his long lost son. The sick and struggling Jimmy Gator played by Phillip Baker Hall who once was a game show juggernaut and now has lost his steam and just wants to leave show business altogether. Stanley Spector played by Jeremy Blackman, a young genius who is pulling his teams weight on a game show and has a break down and decides two days away from beating a record for being on the game show to give up on trying. And the last main character is Quiz Kid Donnie Smith played by William H. Macy who wants to give love, but he doesn't know where to put it and is also struggling financially.All of these characters intertwine into one story of love, despair, sadness and emotionally draining situations. P.T. Anderson really cares for his characters and it shines through this brilliant piece of film making which shows that not all holly wood marketed films are bad. Most of the actors in this movie were also in Boogie Nights and both films are basically equally great. Everyone can look forward to the masterpieces that Anderson will probably release and this film is not an exception. If your in the mood for great film making and acting, see Magnlia it disappoints no one."When the sunshine dont work, the good lord bring the rain in."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film late last night, not the best time to a view a film of this calibre and complexity. I have to say that when I switched off my DVD player I was to say the least slightly confused as to Pt.Anderson's purpose of the frog scene, I have since come up with a few of my own idea's but I would warmly welcome other's input to this amazingly whimsical scene.We can devise from this film a lot about life and how we should live it. Along with reasons why others live life the way that they do. Magnolia is a near masterpiece to say the least with an important message of empathy at its core, which should be a virtue apparent in every human being's soul.The music in this film is of unparalleled greatness and adds so much more than just atmosphere to the film. It helps tear open the character's souls for insepection by the audiance, so that we can see their true selves and empathize.If you have not seen this film then I would strongly recommend that you give it a viewing as I would go as far as calling it a modern classic. It is intensely original and has gone sraight into my top 10 (after my mind was put back into gear, I figured out where I was again and regained bodily functions.)This film is very complicated and over 3hours in length so the average film-goer will probably not appreciate this one. This is a film for those of you out there that prefer a more arty, deep and challenging film as apposed to the average Adam Sandler film or latest bond flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is in some ways good and in other ways great. Some of the characters and some of the scenes are completely true to life while others are slightly skewed, providing an interesting glimpse into an alternate reality. Where the movie fails, I think, is in the resolution, trying to tie everything together and not quite pulling it off. Not everything is clear in the end, which may have been intentional, but some of the unresolved questions are more frustrating than thought-provoking. The bizarre frog scene manages to mask the dissimilarity of the stories, but we still have a hard time believing these tales could coexist in the same world. And despite the premise and the frame involving "coincidences," the coincidental nature of the stories seems inconsequential. Cruise's subplot is *very* loosely connected to the gameshow storyline, so much so that it could easily have been removed without any effect on the remaining plot.Still, this film is very interesting, beautifully filmed, and emotionally engaging. Anyone who enjoys character studies will not be disappointed with Magnolia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a story of scenarios involving several different characters in which some way are linked.First off you have Frank T.J Mackey (the brilliant Tom Cruise),a sex therapist who runs shows for frustrated males,Franks father Earl Partridge,Earl's wife Linda Partridge. The story between this family is that Earl is dying,Linda is supporting him,and Frank wants nothing to do with him for walking out on his mother when she was terminally ill.Then theres other related stories with the gay lonely man,the quiz kid,the drug addict and the cop. Magnolia is overlong but is beautiful the way each story is told in detail.Some of the stories can be harrowing and depressing,but some of them come to the terms of the happy ending. The only thing I don't understand is what do the frogs have to do with the whole story. Aimee Mann provides the depressing but beautiful soundtrack to the movie in which a way makes everything better and is played at the right time in the movie (especially the end). So I reccommend it,if your looking for something more of this type but more controversial I would say try Happiness. I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`In this life, it's not what you hope for, it's not what you deserve -- it's what you take.'Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant `Magnolia' has so many great aspects that a true film lover just chews up. His films in the past have been flat (Hard Eight) and overly vile (Boogie Nights) but this film written by him also shows his true talent. In his other two films you see his talent but the fact is they fall short especially `Boogie Nights' because they are overly tacky and drab. `Hard Eight' is a great film it just doesn't do what `Magnolia' does. With his use of brilliant dialogue and useful camerawork you get so much from each viewing. He overtakes his shots like Scorsese does and just leaves the camera in one spot or follows characters for a long period of time. He does this brilliantly. `Magnolia' has a story that follows a day in the life of a large group of people separated by life but in the same zest pool of humanity that plagues our country. Strictly every aspect of American culture is in the fabric of the characters, it in some sorts is like a depressing `Simpsons.' It tells so much about each character that you just seem to know what they will do next but they are so unpredictable they surprise you with each mannerism. I was so surprised that it was so much more tasteful then `Boogie Nights' which bye any standard is a porno. It is one thing to shock and use that to say something about humanity, it is a complete other to welcome that shock into the film as if it were dialogue. `Magnolia' does not say one word that I shouldn't every word is useful and true. It makes you cringe with it's brutality towards truth, but in it's three hours pays off. More than most films that use curse words as if they were spaces between words. This film does have brutal language but offers you something with it. Tom Cruise's (in one of his best roles) character T.J. Mackey is a slime ball in every sense of the word, a man that is what makes this world horrible, and his language is as distasteful as it gets. `Denise. Denise the piece.' However Philip Seymour Hoffman's character Phil Parma, or John C. Reily's character Jim Kurring hardly say one thing that is offensive. The word use even tells the viewer something about the character.` I used to be smart, but now I'm just stupid.'The film's true heart lies simply in its moral. It offers so much truth in the idea that we are all wrong, all of us. We don't do right when we have the chance we only just do and forget. `The book says, we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.' The tagline of the film says `When it rains, it pours.' Society must see this harsh truth or it will suffer, but the film doesn't fix it's characters it doesn't have a happy ending, it knows that people don't and won't change, thus the musical aspect of the film when all the characters are singing `it's not going to stop, so just give up.' That is so true and so real that any person that has half a brain thinks about it. What we are is not right, not good, and certainly not worthy of any after life that may be set for the fraction of good people that exists within our society. Every time we are given a chance to shine we fail, maybe not in all aspects but certainly morally which by any standard is the most important. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a film that maybe supplies a much needed wake-up call to society, but the truth is it won't wake up a soul. The film says that so well, and so respectively. The language is hurtful and harsh but so are people. It's one of those mirror films that just simply show what is going on, what makes this one different is that it has artistic quality. This gets it up to par with some of the great American films. `I will not apologize for who I am.' Neither will society and it will pay it does in this film.`..this is my job and I love it. Because I want to do well -- in this life and in this world, I want to do well. And I want to help people. And I might get twenty bad calls a day. But one time I can help someone and make a save -- correct a wrong or right a situation -- then I'm a happy cop. And as we move through this life we should try and do good. Do good... And if we can do that, and not hurt anyone else, well... then...'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Magnolia' is a story of Chance, Coincidence and Chaos.These are presented as features of the world and of human lives.But the lives portrayed are not entirely seen as being at the mercy of chance; there is a strong determinist thread running through each of the characters histories.The controlling past throws our lives into chaos, but the randomness of chance can paradoxically restore some order.All parts are well acted in this movie, but Tom Cruse is perhaps especially good.Why though, does he possess that attitude towards women?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another of the great ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't consider myself a connosieur of great movies, I just know how I feel when watching a movie, and Magnolia evoked some of the strongest emotions ever from me. I had an impending sense of doom from the opening scene and 2/3 through was absolutely certain that every main character was going to die to escape the horror of it all. Everday life at breakneck speed. I've always been a very empathetic person due to my own personal tragedies and cried throughout this movie because I felt and could understand the pain and agony of the characters. One user comment asked, Did every character have to break down in tears? Each of us is not being true to ourselves if we don't admit that there are unresolved issues in our lives that we want to scream, yell, cry, pound the walls and fall out on the floor about. As for the frogs, a miracle was needed to stop everyones headlong descent into death, despair and oblivion, and I commend P. T. Anderson on his courage to show us a whopper of a miracle. After watching Boogie Nights and now this movie, Mr. Anderson has a true fan in me. THANKS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>relentlessly bleak...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always hard to pan a film that has so much ambition but this movie is such an ordeal to watch that you feel you have to warn people ahead of time. Relentlessly bleak, overlong, and played at fever pitch it comes off like a second rate Bergman film with a script by David Mamet. Populated with unlikeable or simple characters, it has a falseness to it. Life is not like this (as the film contends)...at least mine isn't. There are tragedies and mistakes but there is also love and laughter. Perhaps a fair penance for some in the audience it is too harsh a punishment for the rest of us.p.s. Aimee Mann's music is perfect for the film: insipid and whiny. If you like that kind of music, it's a wonder you haven't killed yourself already.p.p.s. Isn't it fascinating that Cruise gives the best performance of his career as a hypermasculine male? Now that's real acting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A whole bunch of stories and characters are intertwined and interspliced, only to come together in breathtaking fashion at the climax. The plotting is straight out of an Altman film, which this clearly was meant to emulate. Cruise, who I normally despise, is magnificent and deserved an Oscar as an errant son come home. Probably not a film to see more than once, as it is over three hours long. But what a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sins of the Fathers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short, since the movie was long. Most films work that way. The longer they are, the less you need to say, and vice-versa (speaking of which...). I loved this movie. Intense, confusing, inspiring and incredibly well-acted. This is the kind of movie for which actors study.All the technical elements are top-notch. The players are superb and the writing is special. This is a rare film experience. It may illicit adoration or frustration depending upon your perspective. It's out-of-style subtlety demands your complete attention. I can understand why so many people turn their nose up at a work like this, it's so ambitious that it invites it. It's also easy to see why so many love it, it earns it.Finally, the "frogs". There seem to be as many valid opinions on their symbolism as there are viewers. Personally, I interpreted them to be a wide-spectrum response from the heavens on the theme of "Sins of our Fathers". Analyzing how the "frogs" affect each character in respect to their participation in the stated theme brought to light very interesting commentary on the creators' views, and provoked some serious thought on my own. Regardless, it may well be remembered as one of the greatest scenes of all-time.Bottom line: whatever your take, if you have the time and the stomach for it (lots of serious, powerful subject matter), it's worth a look. My score: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative vibes...intangible emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Magnolia' is, if nothing else, a genuine artistic statement. One that can only be described by evoking it's own name. Although one could consider the film reminiscent, or even derivative of Robert Altman's own unique filmmaking style, we could simply consider this happenstance or even an intended homage and skip right past that particular pointing finger. The ambiance evoked within the film is fascinating and steeped with an intangible &amp; shadowy essence that pushes the tide of the films events along quite nicely. What I found most fascinating about the film is the way in which the character sketches played themselves out. The characters that the film revolved about seemed to exist as stylistic archetypes rather than 'real' people which one would or even should identify with or connect to on an emotional level. I honestly, did not truly 'care' about anyone in this movie. Yet this somehow, in the hands of the filmmaker and his appointed acting crew, worked in it's favor, perhaps because the presentation of the characters simply avoided the melodrama and emotion that would simply side-step the deeper, less tangible &amp; ambiguous soul-searching the denizens of the film are intended to display. The much maligned (and oft-loved) 'amphibian storm' that ties the film together seems to affirm the symbolic bent of the film. Overall, I found it to be a very effective film that stuck with me for quite awhile for reasons I am still unable to pinpoint. There are several lucid moments &amp; scenes in the film that convey much more than the 'here and now' of the image flitting across the eyeballs, acting like little incorporeal time-bombs that hatch in the mind days later. The 'meaning' of it all is still rather cryptic and diffuse. Is the film a shallow and exploitative noir-opera? Is it a film that attempts to splay open the dark side of the American society? Is it a portrait of humanity's endless soul-searching? Is it...? Overall, I feel a film like 'Ice Storm' was able to more explicitly capture the essence that P.T. Anderson was chasing. But in the process, the strange ether-zone he ultimately channeled his cinematic vision into is oddly compelling and highly effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a mosaic of American lifestyle developed through a series of funny and sensuous scenes. It's a portrait of a lonely city, an original exploration of hidden elements of the crisis. In this film Paul Thomas Anderson is revealed as an explorator of taboo subjects of American culture.I can't deny Magnolia was a pretty interesting film, since it shows the way some Americans live. It also shows different love stories. The acting was marvelous, but a little bit shallow. This is definitely the best movie that Tom Cruise has carried out. His academy award nomination for best actor in a supporting role was well deserved. Paul Anderson has really made a movie that keeps most of the people wondering what this film was. Why did many people like this? I didn't really like it much. I thought it was fairly interesting, but these are not the kinds of movies I like. It was too confusing and unbelievable. I don't really care that it lasted about three hours, but it wasn't truly necessary to be that long. The scene of the frogs was quite unbelievable and funny, but I don't deny it was original. The plot is somewhat weak, since it's not clear. Overall I don't think I wasted my time by seeing this movie, but it wasn't as great as I thought it'd be. 6/10</fullReview>

This is a film that grabs you from the start and pounds your senses into an exhausted submission, its seldom that a film can move you just through the power of the script and actors. P.T.Anderson in all his films thus far manages to esemble a cast that you would be suprised to be in the same film and Magnolia is no exception. The performance of Tom Cruise is outstanding and defies critics who have him just down as an action hero. This film is simply brilliant, i strongly advise everyone to give it a go, ignore the criticisms, this is new, fresh, diffrent and simply amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many great dramas Magnolia, with its interwoven tales of broken hearts and damaged lives, is depressing viewing for much of the way yet it is so emotionally powerful that I found it more gripping than almost any thriller or action movie. The actors - including Tom Cruise - are all superb and the climax is one of the most startling and appropriate I've ever seen - it acts as some kind of emotional catharsis after all the turmoil the characters suffered. Perhaps the mark of a great film is that you want to see it again shortly after it finishes. For me Magnolia was like that.It also has an excellent soundtrack, mainly written by Aimee Mann.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fanatical about movies and I usually don't get too involved when I watch them but Magnolia IS different. I haven't seen such an original, extremely intelligent, intense and deep movie in all my life. I have recommended it to friends, I've watched it three times and for the first time in my life I bought, rather than rent, the tape as well! If you are an expert about movies, Magnolia is a must! Your knowledge would be extremely and inadmissibly lacking if you didn't watch it! It is an epiphany for everybody who hasn't done any kind of soul search in their life before. It is an epiphany for those who have been soul searching all their lives! It is simply for everybody! The plot is excellent, the actors are stunning, Anderson is a genius and trying to explain it would mean spoil its inner message. Plus this is a kind of movie that, more than any other, has different levels of understanding and it is vital that everybody finds their own, as I said before, their own epiphany. I've never had any interest in acting before but, after seeing Magnolia, I've actually started thinking of it. My dream would be to be an extra in one of his movies: it would be such an honour! I definitely give it ten out of ten and I look forward to Anderson's new movie! Congratulations!</fullReview>

They eventually all mesh together; creating a beautiful film. First rate cast. Tom Cruise (who's always left me wondering "is that all there is?") really sinks his teeth into this role; a smarmy, chauvinistic motivational speaker who "teaches" men how to get women. I only mention him because he was such a pleasant surprise. The rest are even better. The randomness in this movie is really anything but.........I've seen it at least 5 times and it plays better with each viewing as you can better appreciate the mastery with which it was done.

		<fullReview>Yes, it's more interesting than the factory product cranked out by the studios. Yes, it has some good performances, and I appreciate that it's character driven. No, it's not good enough to be in the IMDB Top 250. And no, overall it's not a very good movie.Hell, yes, it's too long! And you can't tell me it had to be. This is two movies here. Think about it. Wouldn't it have been interesting to watch the second movie and catch all the intersections with the first movie? But more importantly, it would show a little more respect to the audience not to make them sit in the theatre for umpteen hours waiting for this movie to get to the point. It's pretty clear to me that Mr. Anderson needed someone to tell him to be a little less indulgent and a little more respectful of his audience. He would have said everything he wanted to say here in two movies, had some interesting fun with the connections between the two movies, and quite frankly made more money. And yes, it's important to show the studio suits that art and character driven movies can make money. That way we don't have to watch CLIFFHANGER, PART NINE.One more thing: Did EVERYONE in this movie have to have a scene where they broke down in tears? Overkill is overkill, no matter how you dress it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>complicated, but pure genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie has ever wow'ed me more than P.T. Anderson's Magnolia. It runs long at over 3 hours, but I see no way around it. Ending this movie any second early would take away the superb acting, perfect plot structure, and incredible film technique. I'd say that this movie has one of, if not the best ensemble cast ever. I couldn't believe that the critics had to decide who should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor. They all deserved it, though in my mind, Philip Baker Hall should have won. Overall the film is complicated.. we not only have the theme set up at the beginning about strange coincidences, but the relationship between the parallels between sets of characters in the movie are fascinating. We notice the almost identical struggles of characters like Stanley and Frank, Jimmy and Earl, Stanley and Donny, Claudia and Linda, Jim and Frank.... the list goes on and the relationships overlap. As if these struggles aren't obvious enough by the story line, P.T. Anderson spells them out for us in soliloquoys, seemingly random quotes by the characters, and through music. There is absolutely no way that one could find this movie confusing when everything is presented for you on the screen in such a neat little package. I've heard complaints about the frogs, but I honestly see no way the movie could have gotten around them. This instance ties the story together, gives meaning to the characters lives, and is one of the most daring and brilliant scenes I have ever seen. If I were to give this film a rating, it'd be two thumbs up, 5 stars, 11 out of 10, etc. I definitely see how it is ranked so high on the top 250 list, and if it were my list, it would make the top ten. If you want an exciting, action-packed movie, and have a short attention span..see trashy movies like Fast and the Furious or Rollerball, or a Steven Spielberg picture. If you want to see a beautifully crafted, acted film that is almost guaranteed to change your movie-going experience for the rest of your life, see Magnolia.</fullReview>

He played this guy who gives seminars on how to score with women. Then he learns his dad is dying. So, he goes to see his dying dad. What follows is PURE EMOTION. It made me greatful that I have a good dad. Apparently Jason Robarts was a real jerk to Tom Cruise during his early life (in the movie that is). The other wonderful performance is by Phillip Seymore Thomas. That guy can play so many different kinds of characters!! He was in Boogie Nights as the camera man and he was also in Talented Mr. Ripley as the evil rich snob. Anyway, I would consider buying this movie. It was all good. Three thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very long film. If you have the attention span of the average viewer, then don't bother. If you are a film lover, then dig in, because this film is as full as it is long. Full of the vagaries of life, the sad, the awful, the tragic, and even the humorous moments that lie in between. As usual Paul Thomas Anderson takes a terrific story, and enlists as many fine actors as one possibly can, to flesh out the tale. This film has many stars, but all are given the chance to shine, and all do, brightly. Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, the list is as long as Magnolia itself. The stories told within could have produced two or three smaller films, but Paul Thomas Anderson chose to combine them all,and remarkably pulls it off. No Car chases, No big budget stunts, just people, and their lives, drawn here with a sometimes cynical eye, the story is the thing. People are cruel, and foolish, and sometimes maddening, but here they are always interesting. Four Stars out of a possible four.Highly Recommended.****.</fullReview>

It was like watching a dumb-ass sci-fi movie from the 50's with such a horrible script and even worse actors you just keep looking at the snowy screen long after the movie ends and wonder if there's a meaning to life. It felt like that. After the falling frog scene I kept watching the screen for over a quarter of an hour, stunned, shocked to say the least,as this is the grand finale, and the movie, pleased with itself ends, leaving you to ponder the meaning of life. It was a waste of time, but that's just my opinion, if anyone knows a reasonable explanation to this movie I will be more that happy to hear it, but untill then I will keep myself convinced that the actors just didn't want to continue doing the movie so the director had to come up with a sudden and therefore lousy ending</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are some people who really like this movie. they are justified in this. the film was very engrossing for me. it was a little over three hours, but because scenes were switching all of the time and you didnt spend much more than five minuets on any one scene at a time...i was not bored. the acting was good, the cinematography was very nice as well. the problem with this movie is that you know what the director, writer, narrator (whoever it is that is attempting to get a message across to us) is telling us within the first ten minuets. really the movie goes no further on its theme in the next three hours. yes it does sidetrack itself into some thoughts on forgivness, honesty, and the relationships between parents and their children, but it does not elaborate on those themes enough to make them major or even noteworthy. what i am trying to say with this review is that yes, this movie is good, but no, it is not as great as everyone has been trying to say. and actually there are some things (like the sing along and the frogs) that might serve their purpose, but are a little cheesy. so that this review does not sound to critical...i just want to say that i did really enjoy watching it and seeing what would happen. i enjoyed the game show parts...i liked the acting of william h. macey and the guy who played the nurse. for all of those who love this movie...i understand. it is hip, stylish and fun to watch. for all of those who dont...i understand. it is often thin and rather predictable (apart from the frog thing). have a beautiful life readers</fullReview>

At first, I was prepared to shut it down, and take it back to the rental store. But giving it a few more minutes, I was drawn in by the immediate, and deep character development. The three hours that passed were highly entertaining, thought provoking, and I hardly noticed the length.I don't (want to) think I'm the minority here, but why does the language have to be so offensive. Why is there a need to see a couple sexing it up in the opening sequence, and why does Tom Cruise's character have to be demoralizing to a potential 50% of the audience?The situational intensity of the characters does not require these elements. I found Tom Cruises motivational message ridiculous and silly. This part of Tom's character could have been communicated another way.I can handle the drug addiction, and the unfaithful spouses, but the combination of all the elements make the story too dark. I wouldn't have my wife sit through it.This is an extremely artistic production, and bears witness to some great writing and cinematography, but I feel cheated that I couldn't be comfortable sharing this with my wife.

In no way is this a happy go lucky movie - it is serious and it is long.Any humour in this movie usually leaves a bittersweet taste but if you are in the right mood this movie makes you think about relationships and how they affect each and every one of us and hopefully inspires us all to try and examine ourselves and hopefully try and empathize a bit more, be more truthful and think about how our actions can affect people around us.Thoughtful and Inspiring Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anderson does it again, Magnolia is a class act, but it took me a while to come to this conclusion. You see, this film requires digesting for a few days before you understand the intricate emotions and problems that this picture delivers. What is it about? Redemption and forgiveness, I guess. It's about lives and wierd things that happen to our world, neighbours, your friend etcetc.I think the film will mean something slightly different from person to person.The direction is class, Anderson is a character man. The characters shape the story, they provide the narrative, they are the film!The photography is beautiful, the wide-screen frame is used very well. I love anamorphic lenses, so does the director. 43% of the picture is missed in pan and scan, do not insult the art by watching it full frame.The acting is fantastic, quality from start to finish. I can't and won't single anyone out because they deserve equal praise.Magnolia has divided audiences, at 3 hours the film is verrry long, but it has so much to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie EVER (next to Star Wars)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been curious about this film and what it was about, and a friend of mine told me to rent it sometime. Little did I know... Magnolia is basically nine different storylines that are all similar to each other, related to each other, and revolve around a center, like the structure of a magnolia flower. They all, in my mind, dealt with forgiveness, regret, love, and the idea that everything happens for a reason. I say "in my mind" because it's what I got from the film, and what I got may differ slightly from the director's original artistic intentions. Anywho... The acting in this film is astonishing, with Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, and John C. Reilly being the main scene-stealers. Director P.T. Anderson shows us that he truly cares for his characters. The music is excellent, as well, which is performed by the amazingly talented singer/songwriter Aimee Mann. Supertramp also jumps in with some classics, which adds a nice flavor to the film, but Aimee Mann destroys the competition with "Save Me" and the tear-jerker "Wise Up". The interesting thing? P.T. Anderson actually wrote this film as an adaptation of Aimee Mann songs, of which he put on the soundtrack. Granted, this movie is not for everybody. If you're the type that sees movies for cheap thrills, big explosions, fast cars, and hot chicks, then go see that disposable hunk of crap known as "The Fast and the Furious". However, if you're into films that require thinking, such as American Beauty, Memento, Requiem for a Dream, etc., then you will most likely enjoy this film. Don't let what people say about the length bother you. They make it sound like if it's any more than 3 hours, then it's garbage. Folks, it's 3 hours and 8 minutes. Come on. 8 freakin' minutes. Stop your belly-achin'. Best part of the movie? Easy. The scene where all the characters are singing along to "Wise Up" is easily the most emotionally draining scene I've seen in a long time. It centralizes the idea of the film. It makes the film what it is. It is the center of the magnolia, so to speak. I highly reccommend this film. It will leave you breathless and drained of all emotion. You will be contemplating this film in your head for a very long time. And the frogs? Well, you'll just have to see and make your own conlusions from it. There is no one explanation to it. HUGE props to P.T. Anderson for crafting the best film in the past 10 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS. I would definitely recommend this film. The stories it tells are compelling and the performances are first rate. The obvious parallel in structure is to the movie Shortcuts." This movie lacks the narrative cohesion of Shortcuts and I would comment that this very ambitious movie's reach exceeds its grasp to some extent. But I would say that it differs from Altman's film in genre in important ways which make its focus different &amp; I therefore don't feel it is productive to dwell too much on the comparison. I would label this a "generation x" movie(Anderson would probably dislike that) for lack of a better term -- if there isn't a more accurately descriptive label for these types of movies there should be. The movies in this genre have an "off the wall" quality(again, a crude categorization). Examples that come to mind are "Clerks," "Henry Fool," or "Buffalo 66"(I see a kind of parallel to the group singing of "Wise Up" to, for example, the dance sequence by Christina Ricci in "Buffalo 66." These movies mix humor with pathos--one of the important techniques in "Magnolia." The performances are truly powerful and would not be possible without the screenplay. Jason Robards' performance is all the more moving because he himself died the next year of cancer. Tom Curise's performance may be the most memorable and seems even more authentic when I learned that he felt the pressure of close parallels in his life as regarding his strained relations with his own father. I think this is one of Cruise's finest acting jobs. And then there are the frogs--see Exodus 8 in the old Testament. Also it has been rumored to me that this phenomenon really does occur! They get sucked up into the atmosphere due to unusual wind conditions --or something like that. Note quiz kid Jeremy Black's comment to himself that this sort of thing does happen. And Melora Walters' weak smile at the end is the most touching moment in the movie for me--a faint affirmation in the face of the total adversity of life, a ray of hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one to praise movies lightly. Yet I find it very difficult to find anything wrong with this movie. It is difficult to watch it and not see a reflection of oneself in any of the characters, if not with all, as it was in my case.Although the "wise up" seen is one of the most criticized, I believe that it is the one that truly captures the essence of the film. Who has never sang along to a depressing song that fit the mood of the particular situation that he or she was in. It proves how although everyone may feel alone, this loneliness is one of the fundamental things that brings individuals together. It saddens me to see people that do not realize the merit of this scene. IF it is too difficult for someone to understand, maybe they should watch the REM video "Everybody Hurts" and see the same theme on a level that appeals to the lowest common denominator (This is not a slur towards that excellent video).The other most criticized scene is the biblical one. It is another excellent scene, not only for its obvious biblical allusion but in keeping with the "anything can happen" theme presented at the film's start.It is very hard for me to summarize into a few words how much I enjoyed this film. It is very depressing that people disregard its obvious merit based on its length, which is not even a factor in my mind.The final thought that plagues me as I read through the user comments and the top 250 movies. This excellent movie was in the low hundreds, while a movie like sixth sense is 47.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appalling drivel, attempting to create sympathy by endless shouting at the camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has received a lot of acclaim since it was released in 1999, and I finally got around to renting it on DVD a few weeks ago. Sunday evening, 8pm. Bad idea.To begin with, this film is long, more than 3 hours. That alone doesn't make it bad, but it certainly helps. We simply weren't prepared for the sheer length of it.Then there's the acting. For some reason, there is a kind of director who directs a kind of film where there is a lot of shouting. Magnolia is one of those films. There is barely a single scene in this film that doesn't involve someone screaming out their lines, frequently crying at the same time. It is a film that is all loudness and fury, to the point where you can no longer distinguish any emotion at all. It becomes strangely bland and unemotional, a victim of the director's failure to vary the intensity at all.Some performances are good -- Tom Cruise has his moments as the motivational speaker Frank T.J. Mackey, in particular -- but in general every part is so overplayed and overstated, and repeated over and over and over, until you're screaming "I get it! You're upset, you're depressed, you're dying. I know, I know. I understand goddamit!"Having seen, I'm sure, Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" six years earlier, the director could hardly have failed to notice the similarities between this and that film. Indeed, they have a lot in common, but where Short Cuts weaved interesting, intricate connections between the characters, Magnolia simply states them, and the tiny sense of surprise near the end as to the overall connection between the events is of no particular interest. It certainly does nothing to live up to the promise made at the start of the film of a story about strange co-incidences.This film is one damn thing after the other, in a meaningless sequence, begging to finish from about an hour-and-half in, and only getting it's appeal met in double that time.Yes, there is a scene where frogs fall out of the sky. So what? It wouldn't make a difference if there was a scene where the entire cast of Jurrasic Park fell out of the sky. It's all just one more tiresome event in a movie that is full of them. The only reason anyone gets excited about this scene is because something finally HAPPENS in this film other than people shouting at each other.The film has its good points -- there are some well acted and amusing scenes, and it is possible to find some humour here and there. But overall this is one of the longest, most exhausting films I have ever watched, and in my opinion, would only really appeal to people who require a four-pound hammer to make a point where a toothpick would do just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only comment on the first seventy minutes of this movie as by then I was bleeding from the eyes through boredom. I loved Boogie Nights and looked forward to Magnolia so much that I bought it, unseen, on DVD. The intro was very good and promised an intelligent, thought provoking drama. Instead there was only tedious soap style vignettes with unconvincing swearing standing in for a script. Throughout all this was the most annoying and intrusive music I have ever heard in a film. The songs just went on and on and on while the dialogue, for what it was worth, got lost like inane conversation in a disco bar. The previous evening I treated myself to a rerun of the 1956 version of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers which only lasts ten or so minutes more than I gave Magnolia, yet Magnolia had me yawning and looking at the clock, dreading yet another two hours of this drivel. Paul Thomas Anderson has shown great promise but will sink himself completely if he thinks this pretentious nonsense has any depth, merit, or even simple entertainment value. It doesn't. And by the way, Tom Cruise's over the top performance was simply an embarrassingly transparent act that he couldn't pull off. To see how this is done properly, check out John Tutturro in The Big Lebowski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow in parts and involved, yet thoroughly rewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderfully shot movie, with moving camera, warm lighting and interesting characters. Add to that a hugely experienced and talented cast and you have the makings of a fantastic film.There are a few instances where I found myself wishing the story along, and wondering what the possible outcome of the intricately weaved stories could be, and in the end I felt slightly disappointed when this was not as amazing as the build up, and perhaps my own imagination, had made this.However, the ending was extremely well done, and mirrored real life, with as many unanswered questions as completed tales. In fact, I don't think you could say that any of the tales are, in fact, complete. Again, much like real life. Which is a hugely satisfying thing to see from Hollywood.Tom Cruise will stun you in this, possibly, as I've heard, this character is somewhat close to his real character. Who knows, I don't. Jason Robards, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are wonderful too, and not just because I have the biggest crush on Ms Moore...Watch this, stick out the few short periods where you wonder what's going to happen and get a sore bum, and you will have a hugely rewarding experience. In fact, I think I'll watch it again this week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "the Blair Witch Project"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia" has plenty of great actors giving good performances, and it has more than a few memorable scenes. Unfortunately, after 100 minutes have passed, we're waiting for the movie to end. When the end finally comes, we're wondering why it took so long. As others have said, Robert Altman did a better job telling a similar story in "Short Cuts" (1993). Altman's protege Alan Rudolph even did a better job in the flawed "Welcome to L.A." back in 1977.P.T. Anderson tries to impress us with details, but minutiae are no substitute for good writing. At least two of the three examples of odd coincidences in the prologue are urban legends that have been debunked on the Internet (The dead scuba diver in the tree and the suicidal jumper who was shot by one of his parents). Perhaps the prologue warns us that the movie is going to waste our time much like these tall tales did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Anderson is a bright guy. If you read any further you will not find another compliment. Magnolia is a dizzying siege of agonizingly misspent emotion and talent. The only thing that upset me more than the movie is the arrogant pseudo-intellectual faction that followed it. Several critics, who have replaced Citizen Kane with Magnolia in the theater-house Parthenon, have been so bold as to say that if you didn't like Magnolia, you're not intelligent or sophisticated or deep. B******t. Some scenes of Magnolia are interesting or even brilliant as they stand alone, but collectively there is an unhappy disjointedness to the pace and continuity. Along these lines, Magnolia is one of the most bizarre and frustrating moviegoing experiences I've ever had. The acting is fantastic (Cruise gave a career performance), the concept is interesting, and the writing is excellent, yet the amalgam is almost incoherent. I read that Anderson says that Magnolia is the best movie he will ever make. Not true. Boogie Nights was better and, if he continues to make movies, Anderson will best his own expectations.

These characters range from a lonely cop who only wants to do good in life, the drug addicted woman who he falls for, her incestuous, cancer-stricken father/game show host, two starring brainiac contestants (one a winner from way back in the 60s, the other a neglected child), the dying man who produces the show, and his regretful wife, caring nurse, and long lost son. Somehow all of these people share their emotional extremes together in waves of misery and nirvhana all on one full moon-ish day.Director Paul Thomas Anderson tells us a heartfelt story with pain and joy to spare. Although utterly bizarre, "MAGNOLIA" miraculously rings truth, despite several odd moments of an almost science-fiction nature. At a staggering 3+ hours, it manages to interest the audience and all those who are willing to put in the time and observe three dimensional characters interacting realistically for once. A triumph, it still never manages to have a clear emotional climax, it all sort of runs together in a big blotch of sorrow and every sinful situation you can think of. But lets ask ourselves: does that really matter? If you just want to connect with a handful of people without a phone or modem, no. This is the type of movie you will walk away from hoping for a part 2, like a favorite soap opera where you save a certain part within yourself to care and hope for these imaginary characters. Wrenching and brilliant, if even flawed at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a movie involving a number of different stories that all seem to be connected by the sadness and loneliness involved in each one of them. I've talked with people about this movie and for the most part it's a movie you either love or hate, like the Blair Witch Project and Eyes Wide Shut that have that same dinamic. I loved this movie. I thought this film did a great job in connecting the stories and playing them so they don't feel sloppy. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances ever, and the others from Williem H. Macy's character to Julianne Moore's are interesting and for the most part believable. It's long but it kept my attention well. I won't give away the ending but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. It's totally unexpected, very strange, and fairly compelling. I can't quite give this movie a 10 because I felt it could have come together a little better. Still it's a wonderful movie. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the three best films of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Wes Anderson's Rushmore, and P.T. Anderson's other masterpice, Boogie Nights, Magnolia is one of the best three films of the 90's. Magnolia is a series of interlocking stories: The characters include Stanley Spector( an amazing performance by young Jeremy Blackman), a current quiz kid champion who wants to be loved by his father; Frank T.J. Mackey( Tom Cruise), a sexist motivational speaker who gives speeches on how to "seduce and destroy" women, former quiz kid Donnie Smith( William H. Macy), now a middle-aged homosexual who is only kept going because of his love for a bartender, a religious cop, Jim Kurring( John C. Reilly) who wants to help people, Claudia Wilson Gator( Melora Walters), a troubled drug addict who is asked out on a date by Jim, who has no idea of her problem; Jimmy Gator( Philip Baker Hall), a dying game show host who is Claudia's father; Earl Partridge ( Jason Robards), a TV producer who is also dying of cancer; Linda Partridge( Julianne Moore), Earl's pill-popping wife; and Phil Parma ( Philip Seymour Hoffman)a kind nurse who goes beyond his career, and actually feels his patients pain, but who really has no life beyond his job, and has a problem communicating with the outside world. Magnolia happens all in one random day, and the characters lives play out with Aimee Mann music in the background( the characters sining "Wise Up" is truly a brilliant cinematic moment). Although Magnolia may be a little too long( 3 hours, 8 minutes), for some viewers, Magnolia takes you on an experience like few other movies do.</fullReview>

The numerous different stories in the film, all about coincidence and chance, are all excellent and I have to say that the ending took me totally by surprise! Some people say that this film is overlong. I have to say that I totally agree with them. At just over three hours long it can be quite a difficult film to watch. I think that the only way this film could have been improved would have been to cut the length slightly and cut out some of the more talkative parts.Overall Magnolia is an excellent film with a good story and good performances.

		<shortDescription>Overall, an enchanting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of those movies that are just difficult to review - perhaps primarily because most people either hate it beyond belief or cherish it as the best ever. I fall in neither category. Instead, I think it is a cinematographic masterpiece laden with magical performances and stunning, unforgettable scenes, but it's bogged down by some severe overacting, boring plot lines and way way way too many F-words. I saw Goodfellas and thought Joe Pesci swears a lot. Never underestimate the power of P.T. Anderson and the F-bomb.Anderson works to create some incredible characters here. John C. Reilly is amazing as a lovable but goofy cop. Jeremy Blackman is superb for a young boy. Melinda Dillon portrays Jimmy Gator's wife with elegance and grace. And Tom Cruise gives the performance of his career. But then you have Julianne Moore, who's just painful to watch (evidence the silly scene at the pharmacy, the lawyer's office, et. al), Jason Robards (how many hours did i spend watching that movie, hoping he would just die already), Philip Seymour Hoffman (liked him a lot in State and Main but couldn't stomach his sniveling nurse here), and, perhaps worst, Melora Walters, whose overacted, coked-up Claudia just clashes.I loved the frogs, especially because Anderson made them gross with the sound and visual effects. I thought the reference to Exodus 8:2 was strong, and I feel it is strong enough to tie together all the vignettes. But the scenes with Robards, Hoffman and Moore (how can Anderson put them all together at once!?) were unbearable. William H. Macy (who I usually love) was only OK as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, perhaps because Anderson wrote his role too over-the-top.I also really liked the black kid from the projects as "the prophet"... added a nice touch to the movie. It would have been even better if I could understand what the $(#@ he was saying.I guess my review isn't poised to champion or insult this film (and i have way too much respect for P.T. Anderson and Boogie Nights to insult Magnolia, which he calls the best movie he will ever make) but I do feel there are positives and negatives. Plot isn't as tight as Boogie Nights or Hard Eight, and I suppose at the end of it all I would have to say this is the worst of his three movies. That doesn't mean it's bad, because Anderson is the most promising American director I've seen in years, but just a little... rough.7.5 or 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont want to blab on and on about this film because nobody wants to hear that. but all i will say is that i was astounded by its level of realism and drama and the fact that it actually dragged me into the story and made me care. i love dramatic movies and they dont come more dramatic than this. ok, so maybe everybody was a little too depressed all the time, but thats life!i am yet to make make a complete understanding of the film and i dont think it is meant to be completely understood. maybe its mystery is what makes it so unique and memorable. SPOILERS the frog rainstorm had me very confused for a while until i really thought about it and realised the implications of it.some scenes in the movie are incredible. just a few of my favourites are when Phillip Seymore Hoffman's character is talking on the phone trying to contact Tom Cruise's character, Julianne Moore losing it in the drug store and Jim and Claudia talking in the restaurant. that scene alone made the movie for me! it was so honest and compelling.overall it was a damn fine movie with realistic flaws (if it was perfect it wouldnt work) believable and deep characters and absolutely superb acting. a round of applause for Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and the actress who played Claudia!!!!!!!if u have 3 hours to spare, see this movie. you may not get it nor appreciate it, but if you do, your life will be changed. and i really mean that even though it sounds a tad over dramatic.a superb timeless modern day classic, well done PT Anderson. 5 stars out of 5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dissecting the frog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been trying to figure out "Magnolia" ever since I saw it. I immediately thought of John Guare's "Six Degrees of Separation," and saw a parallel philosophy with "Magnolia."As far as the frog scene goes, I know it must have something to do with the eighth chapter of Exodus; the whole, "Let My People Go," proclamation. In that chapter, everything is infested by a plague of frogs because the Pharaoh wouldn't release the people. I suppose there is a connection of the freeing of all those hurt souls in the climax of "Magnolia," but, remember, the Biblical plague was executed as punishment because the people WEREN'T liberated. So that kind of counteracts any sense of resolution...Another possibility involves this Southern urban legend about vanishing ponds. I'm not a meterologist and never will be, but I AM Southern and that's enough for me to perpetuate fantastical folklore. The legend is that, with the extreme weather changes in the South, (weather that is loyal to NO season) there have been environmental conditions---that have oscillated so wildly from dry and sunny to humid and cloudy---that water evaporates alarmingly quickly. So quickly, that fish &amp; frogs have been dragged into cloudwater and have fallen from the sky. Or something like that. It IS fantastical, but it's supposedly happened. (And in Shreveport, Louisiana in the 50s, there was a thing about peaches falling from the sky that everybody's grandparents remembers and talks about ad nauseum. I am not making this up.)The whole idea of water makes sense too, as there were a lot of water images in the movie. The weather, for one. They keep giving us written forecasts and then it rains---and it rarely ever rains in Southern California---so that might have been a harbinger of the folklore. Also, water is the most profound expression of life beyond, of course, the voice. We use water as an expression for many things: the little boy peeing under stress as the host of the show, Jimmy Gator, is crying after drinking too much (again with the water) and the whole time everybody's sweating (water), and then they're giving Jimmy Gator water----replacing water with water---when they're trying to sober him up...And then there's release/anger with Tom Cruise's tears at the bedside of his father, there's poor Claudia who has tears in her eyes the WHOLE movie, rain and water and tears and everything it represents plays a huge role in illustrating emotion.Okay, now for the magnolia. Whenever I'm trying to dissect something, I always go for etymological-scalpeling first. If that is unsatisfying, I go for the Bible, as most everything has Judeo-Christian values smeared all in it. If that's unsuccessful (which it was, as I don't remember any profound magnolia stories in the Bible), I go for World mythology. And I don't remember anything in it, either. Frustrating, because the image HAS to have been important---I mean, it's the $#%^&amp; title of the entire movie.Therefore, I figured that the magnolia (a tree exclusive to North America and particularly seen in the South) starts out with pure-white petals cast wide, kind of like we all start out: innocent and opened. Pure. But, if you've ever touched a magnolia, you know that the petal you touched turns brown and withers. I suppose this has something to do with being hurt by other people throughout life and experiencing things that take our innocence. Reminds me of Gerard Manly Hopkins' poem, "Spring and Fall." Also, the"Mag" prefix means something huge and bold, loosely.Anyway, those are my thoughts about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in amongst the Darwin Awards, the first four or five Talking Heads albums, Beck's cut and paste, Tool's songs and of course, the collaborations of Aimee Mann and Jon Brion lurks the magic of Paul Thomas Anderson's twisted and immensely compassionate imagination. And he, in turn, listened very carefully to himself to give us this beautiful film. Much of the crew of Boogie nights are here, many almost beyond recognition. Cruise, Moore and Robards earn their paycheque for working so damned hard and enjoying themselves. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you can't get hold of a copy, borrow mine. Better yet, nick one from somewhere. Not mine, though. I want to watch it again tomorrow for breakfast. If you don't like it, you're not alone. Go back to your Willy Wonka existence. For the rest of us, however, this movie is magic and I simply want to thank you, Paul Thomas Anderson, for flaming the embers on the dying Hollywood campfire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Urban Legends: Believe It or Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I left the theater a moviegoer asked me how the film was. I hesitated and said that it was an ambitious failure. There were moments when I thought "Magnoila" soared: Tom Cruise, who played perhaps his least likable character in the movies, gave an angry, fiery, complex performance. It is interesting what Cruise can do when he's given the chance. Philip Baker Hall, William H. Macy and, in his final performance, Jason Robards, also gave fascinating portraits of people who are trying to come to grips with their past and having a hard time living with themselves in the present. Kudos also go to some other P.T. Anderson regulars: Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse aide to Robards' character and John C. Reilly as the helpful, well-intentioned L.A. beat cop.I also thought Aimee Mann's songs ("Wise Up", and especially, "Save Me") were well-incorporated in the film. It didn't distract, it was a little bit of a Greek chorus. The movie soundtrack on CD even sounds better on its own.I was disappointed with the performances of Juilanne Moore and Melora Walters. I though both women were way over the top. Both characters became annoying to me. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** I guess what put me on the side of disliking the movie was when the frogs started coming down from the sky. After almost three hours, I knew something odd was going to occur, especially since the movie started with several urban legends that may or may not have happened in real life. I was hoping for a strong payoff and what I said out loud in the theater was "OH, COME ON!!!!!" Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson did a better job in his previous film "Boogie Nights". "Magnolia" was just as ambitious but "Boogie Nights" was more focused, documentary-like movie on one man's life in the 70's porn industry. "Magnolia" had flashes of brilliance but in the end was an unfocused, pretentious and wildly uneven epic drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly an amazing movie. Paul Anderson takes the most serious of subjects: dying, guilt, and redemption and infuses them with so much understanding, perception, love, and yes, fun that the movie is a steady tour de force. Even the frogs was a touch of Mexican fantasism that no one blinked twice at. Performances are roundly powerful, and intense; and multiple threads of stories hurtle towards an agonizing climax. Anderson's love of the characters is evident throughout- they are tortured, damaged, losers- but... who isn't. I would have liked to have Cruise's conversation with my father before he went. Have no idea why this movie has an ill-deserved R rating- apart from alot of "f__"'s and a couple of flashes of sex- this isn't an R movie, and it's circulation was probably badly hurt by it. A long (3 hr.), but captivating and arresting film: harsh, brilliant, funny, sad, and hopeful. This isn't Cruise's movie- he's just one of an ensemble- but his pathological over-intensity was never used to better effect. 'Seduce + Destroy' Interesting concept. Mike Hammerschlag</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I needed to see this movie twice to get the whole history. It must have been real complicated to put together because of its twisting script - six stories that are somehow related to each other, though this only surfaces at the end.WARNING! - Stop reading if you have not seen it yet (Contains spoilers).Leaving aside the main fault of Magnolia - the excessive running time, about three hours, it's a well made movie, with an impressive job by Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge and Tom Cruise as Frank, among others. Though I usually don't like this guy's job I must admit he does a good one here. The vocabulary used in Magnolia can outrage people (I'm not one of them), but I think it's necessary, especially in Frank's character to give him a complete dimension. Tom Cruise's character is really mad as hell, with all that talk about taming the female thing and so on. How pathetic is when, asked to give an interview to that female reporter, he takes his shirt off and starts strutting to impress her, which he fails to succeed. And how he gets so upset and hostile when she raises the subject of his past.As commented above, Magnolia is TOO LONG. The scenes in deathbeds bore so much that you certainly yearn for them to end.The scenes which take place on that TV contest called "What Do Children Know?" are interesting to me. And what about Philip Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman's character) getting so heavy in that bar repeating over and over again to the bartender he's got so much love to give? This part is large as well, but fortunately Supertramp's music helps bear it.The parts I like the most are those involving the cop, first in that old woman's house when he wants to search her closet and she keeps refusing. Later he comes to that junkie girl's house answering a complaint about noise. Weird enough both start to feel attracted to each other.One of the few scenes that can be considered as funny is the one when he pours the coffee the junkie girl's made on a plant. Sometimes I've wondered what is the meaning of the policeman losing his gun in the pouring rain.The question many people (Also me) are still wondering is what's the rain frogs supposed to mean? These scenes are impressive, but I'm clueless yet. Don't sit down to watch this movie if you're easily annoyed by offensive language and you like short and joyful stories, cause Magnolia is not either of them. This movie would be a masterpiece with a shorter running time (Twenty or thirty minutes less would have helped), less swearing and less and shorter agony scenes. Unfortunately it's not so and that's why I give it six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1,000 word maximum doesn't begin to describe all the feelings of awe and wonder when seeing this movie for the first time. And I mention first time, because it is imperative to view it at least twice, if not more, to really GET this movie. From the opening sequence of 3 "urban legend" discussions about coincidences to the last half hour, which, in a word, was BREATHLESS, this film hit all the right notes.Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Melinda Dillon, John C. Reilly, Bill Macy, and of course Tom... the cast was outstanding, and some gave possibly their best performances of their careers (Macy , Dillon, and Cruise come to mind).In a few words, the film, for those who have gotten this far, and still have no clue, is about 10 people whose lives intertwine at times, through the course of one day and night, in Southern California. These include a police officer, a self help guru, a game show host and their families. It may not sound like much, and I will describe nothing further, but rent this film, grab a chair, unplug the phone, send the spouse and the kids to Chuckee Cheese, and prepare for a film which will stay with you for many days, weeks and years to come.11 out of 10 -- need I say more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, stimulating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films to come out of the 90s, and Paul Thomas Anderson did a fantastic job with it. Albeit, the movie is not perfect, but considering Anderson wasn't even 30 when he made it, I foresee great things in the future for him. The different story lines, or as it should be more aptly named, character lines, were all intriguing and believable. It could have been more interesting if they had been a little more interconnected, but subtlety was the aim here, and it does work.This movie is engaging if you let it be, in that it requires some thinking on the part of the viewer in order to fully appreciate its value. This is a character study, but not in a traditional sense. I do not want to give away too much if you have not seen the movie, so I will limit my comments to merely that Magnolia is a very emotionally driven film.The directing is superb, although I think Paul Thomas Anderson could have done a bit better job of condensing some of the voice-overs towards the end--not because they were boring, but because he did such a good job of "showing" us things rather than just "telling" us for most of the film. It was almost like he got a bit lazy. Nevertheless, it remains very powerful, and the acting is absolutely great across the board. Tom Cruise is very good in it, but I feel the rest of the cast got shorthanded from all the attention Cruise received. Not to take anything away from his performance, but truly the entire ensemble did great, from frantic Cruise to subtle William H. Macy. Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly also gave very memorable performances.All in all, some viewers simply will not like this film; its unique style, direction, storyline (or lack thereof in some eyes), parallel character development, and brief touches of surrealism will just not sit well with some. But I urge all who have not seen it to chance three hours and find out if you are perhaps not one of these people, because if you do enjoy Magnolia, it is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Try, try again. First of all, I noticed plenty of "Boogie Nights" lovers who generally panned "magnolia." I never saw "Boogie Nights," so I didn't have any expectations. I watched "magnolia" at the wrong moment (when I had pulled a 12-hour workday), so I decided to try watching when I had plenty of rest. It's a fascinating movie, and I became more intrigued the more times I viewed it. I thought at first that the characters at some stage would intersect directly. Although that didn't happen, I still enjoyed the plots and subplots. With several climaxes throughout, the film is a roller-coaster of emotions. It's very, very dark, tackling such things as drug abuse, terminal illness, molestation and other dramatic situations. But this seems to happen in many people's lives. Somewhere I read a comment saying that the movie should have had a brighter ending, some kind of hopeful conclusion. I think too many movies rely on the same hackneyed ending that "magnolia" avoided. Maybe PTA realized that such emotional issues in many cases can't expect a rosy ending. And as to the role of Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) and Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), examine their characters. They are all victims in one way or another. Maybe Mackey has resorted to sexual conquering as his drug to hide the pain of abandonment by a father, forcing him to helplessly watch his mother die. Claudia resorts to drug use and sex to dampen her trauma of being molested by her father. They both are traumatized children, with the pain being inflicted by their fathers.Meanwhile three other children, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), Dixon (Emmanuel Johnson) and Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) are riding that same path to their own destruction: Donnie Smith still has not grown up; Stanley Spector is being used by his father (I'm sure by name-dropping so that he can get a part in a movie), and Dixon has already witnessed at least one murder by his own father, "The Worm."Okay, so Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) curses A LOT. She's a mental case, taking drugs to calm her own emotions. These things happen in real life all the time. A movie finally has taken a realistic (except the frogs, perhaps) look at those relationships. And there are bright spots. I never would have believed that Frank Mackey would actually go to help Linda Partridge...and Rose Gator and Officer Jim Kurring reach out to Claudia. So, okay, I love the movie. Watch it when you're open-minded and not sleepy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five scripts shuffled into one movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday, and I still don't know if I liked it. It is a three hour movie that is so tightly paced that the time goes by very quickly. It feels like someone took five movie scripts and shuffled the pages together into one script. It is a struggle to follow and make sense out of each plot line because the movie cuts between each plot line with the pace and music of an MTV video. At some point, you give up and just let the scenes wash over you faster than you can comprehend. On one hand viewing the movie is an amazing experience with great scenes and great actors. On the other hand, the plots do not really tie together and it does not have a conclusion or make any sense. The ending is particularly goofy and pointless. I would recommend this movie in spite of its flaws because it is so different from any other movie you are going to see and if you don't try to make sense out of it, it is very entertaining.</fullReview>

As mentioned previously Phillip Seymour Hoffmans role as a nurse was so delicate and nataurlistic he was a shoo in to lose the oscar. The interviewer causing a breakdown for CJ Macke, Aimee Manns Wise Up being sung to everyone and of course the Frogs.

		<shortDescription>Amazing film from hugely talented writer/director p.t anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which seems to have spawned two groups of viewers, those who get it and those who don't. It is understandable P.T Anderson's follow up to the acclaimed Boogie Nights is a 3 + hour epic study of human emotion. Anderson has once again enlisted the services of his favourite group of actors (the excellent Reilly, Hoffman, Macy, Hall, Moore) with the much talked about addition of Tom Cruise as sex guru Frank TJ Mackay. The story takes place completly in L.A over the course of 1 long day. Essentially this could be considered Short Cuts 2 and Anderson produces flawless performances from his very talented cast. Even smaller roles are superbly acted and Cruise's turn as Mackay defies all expectations, frequently delievering quotable one liners (i'm quietly judging you). Anderson directs with great skill and like other budding directors (David O Russel, Guy Richie) really shows visual flair (the zooming cancer sequence). This film is extraordianly moving and deals with emotions we all face, depression, loss, desperation. Some have said this film is too depressing and hollow but that is life sometimes, and if this film is 'too depressing' guess what, that is what life is like sometimes. Anderson (29) shows confidence and skill switching between storylines. How many other directors would be brave enough to show his entire cast suddenly break out in song? but the gambit works and feels very appropriate for that moment in the film (however Mann's 'Save Me' would have been a better choice for this scene) This is a film that really requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate as i found the switching between charcters to be a little off putting at first. This is a film of few faults but Anderson does occasionally loose focus of the story at times. Every charcter is so well observed and acted and you can really empathise with many. In short this is frankly an unmissable film and is perhaps one of the greatest of the last decade. Based on this Anderson is destined for great things.</fullReview>

So here's my two cents...- The F-word is used so much because that's the way people talk, especially when they're in high-stress situations.- The script is pretty good but the movie is great because of the wonderful acting and the direction they received.- There was at least one comparison to American Beauty in all these comments, and I found myself almost thinking the same thing after viewing Magnolia for the first time. However, Magnolia still has a more big-budget feel than AB does despite the fact that AB has more "big name" actors (Tom Cruise notwithstanding). The subtlety in the AB script is recalled in the exquisite acting of Reilly (the cop), Hoffman (the nurse), Hall (the game show host) and Walters (the addict). I think what ties the two films is that the characters in both films could be considered stereotypical, until you look closer. (Guess which movie I prefer.)***SPOILER?***- The controversial singing scene was one of the most powerful, emotional scenes I've ever seen....

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided this movie for as long as possible, having watched my own father recently die of cancer. I finally sat and watched last night and found Robard's performance remarkable in his depiction of the final stage of a terminal illness. It was rough to watch but oddly comforting, sort of bringing the point home to me of the universality as well as the banality of death. Many of his mannerisms, random thoughts and sadness of a dying man I saw first hand, and his performance provided me with catharsis.As for the criticism of Julianne Moore, I thought it was refreshing to NOT have a stoic caretaking wife, that her demons and guilt about her past behavior finally caught up with her. As for the dropping of the F*** Bomb, well, perhaps all Anderson was trying to convey is the complete lack of articulation and communication that all the characters suffer from. I liked that Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character of the nurse is the one with so little dialog. In his job he is well aware that words are nothing and that nothing can be said when death occurs.The three hours were not an issue. However, no snack or pee breaks or you are definetly going to be the weeds. The editing of the stories were for the most part clever and affecting, but you have to be fully engaged or else.Small points: I liked the actors taking turns with "Wise Up." Every actor had a different reason for singing. How refreshing and dicey that Anderson is willing to do something off-kilter. Which leads to the frogs...I thought the end was alternately disgusting and hysterically funny. The entirely bizarre nature of the final scene, tied in with the opening and the ongoing weather updates through the film, may be a Biblical reference or Anderson having a good time with an urban legend. Regardless, anyone who lived through that would have a hard time making other people believe it. Maybe Anderson wanted us to take with us the notion that no matter how well planned your life could be, there is always an event that defies explanation. Imbue it with religion or just chalk it up to random weirdness, sometimes things are completely out of our control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard for me to react to this movie on the base level of "like or dislike". I feel that this movie challenged me. It was like watching nine movies at once, all at once, all of them all coming together and occurring at once and it gave me such a headache that I had to get drunk afterwards to get rid of the mental strain; which I don't think implies that I'm stupid, trying to comprehend all that went on, simply that either of two things occurred: 1.) It was too dark and I watched a movie on a tv screen for 3 hours, giving me a headache, or 2.)There was so much going on my head was buckling from all of the things happening. I've now seen this movie twice and still am unable to fully have seen everything inside it. At the beginning its tricky because it has a very slow, welcoming, but fast and engaging beginning that pulls you in. From there we get a nice rounded bunch of pieces of viginettes that draw us into the characters, some more interesting than others (I personally liked the John C. Reilly cop the best). But from then on the movie is basically hours of these events colliding together, all happening at once, and at first when I saw it I thought maybe it was just overdone and the reason I didn't simply get a normal "like/dislike" reaction was because it maybe wasn't done so well, but now I'm starting to think that it was just so densely packed with information and things happening that I just was in over my head. This 2nd time I found myself drawn into things I wasn't as drawn into before, but only maybe 20-30 percent moreso than the first viewing. Maybe it'll take another 6 viewings before I find myself interested in some of the side characters without alot of development (such as the Julianne Moore character, who I found simply not interesting at all). There are some characters I wanted to spend time with more than others, especially the cop and the girl he found, as well as the Tom Cruise character (to some degree), and the Phillip Baker Hall character. There are times when I wish this movie took off in a few of the directions suggested by the multiple plotlines or ideas of plotlines raised in its unfolding, but since I found myself more interested than the first viewing I am going to keep watching this movie and hopefully find myself even more into things I wasn't as into the first or second time. I think that what P.T. Anderson has done is a movie that I haven't really seen before- something so dense and challenging, something that goes against most of what I've spent the majority of my life watching, movies that really pick one straight line and stay with it; you get involved in that line but really its just one line, whereas this movie is made up of so much that you're forced with the idea that there is more to this movie than you think, and that maybe its not the movie that's not doing its job but YOU, that for once you are challenged to re-watch this movie to explore it further, because there's so much to it. Now how many times has THAT happened to you as a moviegoer these days, especially to one from my generation (I'm nearly 20)?????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I really don't know what to say about "Magnolia".I liked it, don't get me wrong. But this is a movie that is so... I want to say strange, but it really isn't all that unusual. But on the other hand, there are several moments of sublime magic realism that could throw some people off (hi, mom).The plot (if that's the word) involves a number of different characters who are each messed up in one way or other and whose lives are intertwined. But that's not what the movie is *about*.I realize my review isn't very good. That's because I seriously don't know what to think of this movie. All I can really say is that "Magnolia" is good, it's long but it doesn't feel like it, and you should all check it out.Ribbit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you say about a movie like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, I have alot of things to say about this movie...I didn't want to address the frogs but since so many others consider it significant I would like to make an important point: I have had the privilege of seeing Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which is also a movie in which you have to accept a fantastical element within the film. This is not something that is really meant to be explained objectively or even analyzed which is why I won't try to analyze it as such. But basically this movie has a little bit of everything in it and hence a supernatural miracle has been fittingly included. It is an excellent collage of reality, conveyed brutally. I was thinking of many strange words to describe this while I was watching it. The latter, (brutal) being one of them. I also thought of "bonanza" funnily enough. It is positivity and negativity, subtly and blatantness, excessiveness and repression, emotion and coherent thought, intelligence and stupidness and how intelligent people are also stupid in their own way (and vice versa), being moral and/or immoral and the way it all gets blurred in our lives. When rights are wronged and wrongs are righted. I went up and down over and over in this movie. I liked the first 10 minutes then I hated the next hour, then I loved the next hour and then I was disillusioned in the last hour because I kept thinking the movie was about to end even though I knew it was supposed to be 3 hours plus. But over all I really liked it: 9/10 I wonder what someone who didn't know anything about the movie before they watched it would think of it. Jesus Christ it would be nuts!! Surely you would get to the point over and over when you kept thinking it was going to suddenly end - perhaps in some harsh fashion with a horrible death and everyone elses stories being left completely up in the air.Ultimately I don't think it is about 'stories.' Life isn't a story it is what it is. And that's what this movie is. It is life.One last interesting point is that if you look at the voting demographics the older people were the less they liked the movie. I wonder what that means. Couldn't they take seeing all the types of things that had been common to them in their lives? One guy made a comment that said "NOT FOR 75 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION." Well, he was right. It is harsh. But if you haven't seen it and you think you can take it I'd say it would be advisable to see it. It could be a beautiful experience for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is special, and very good in a different way. The movie is about life.I just read some of the other reviews, but i think a lot of people dont get the simple meaning with this film.Here is what I think the movie is about:The movie is about to be able to listen to each other, and about taking time in our stressfull everyday, to talk/listen to the people we know and love. It's also about being afraid of what others think about you, and being afraid to learn to know new people. Most importantly the movie is about we first realize all this, when it's nearly or already too late to do something about it. The frogs in the movie is a wakeup-call for the characters.The question of this movie is (after my oppinion):Why is it nescesary in life to be an event/accident to bring people together ?While I am not afraid of speaking of my opinion, and while im not being afraid of a dialogue and can take time to listen, i give this movie 7/10. For a lot of people, perhaps this movie is a wakeup-call, and will change the viewers life-vision (i hope), they will/should rate the movie even higher, because this is a beautiful way of telling so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. When I watched this film I felt very different from my usual movie going experience. Why? Initially, I had no idea. Then it came to me: I'm not just watching a movie, I'm watching Mankind as it unfolds every day of every week of every year. The painful drone of impending doom. The thousand knife pricks and million failures that make up the lives of every human being on the planet. It's no wonder I was a little confused at first, since the movies are the last place I'd expect to find an accurate depiction of nothing less than the Human Condition.Nobody has their s**t together in this film. Nobody wins. Everybody holds on just long enough to live another day, except of course, for those who are dying of cancer. Cancer. Death. It's everywhere in "Magnolia". And yet, the characters keep on going, pushing forward, never upward, only sideways, but they keep moving. They stay alive against all of the blows, all of the fear and humiliation and trauma. That's my definition of the Human Condition.Unlike "2001: A Space Odyssey", there are no sweeping shots of planets or Man in space. Nobody climbs any mountains or writes any symphonies or sees God. The sweep of "Magnolia" is invisible because we're eyelevel with the individual brush strokes of a dozen characters that collectively represent Mankind. It's only when you back up from this picture do you realize what it's all about.The soundtrack is a brilliant musical metronome counting off the time left in the lives of the characters. It smothers us in their tension and desperation and fear. Fear. Fear of humiliation and failure and death. The Cop character: he keeps dropping his night stick. And when he does, his eyes dart around in terror, afraid that someone might see him for the fraud he thinks he is. Every character feels the same way: "I don't belong in the life I'm suppose to be living".The characters achieve nothing and resolve nothing. They don't say anything very profound. They're bewildered and hurting, wondering around North Hollywood subconsciously asking themselves "What the hell am I suppose to be doing here? Why am I being subjected to so much pain and humiliation? Is there a point to all this?" And you know what? Nobody has any answers. There is no hero who saves the day. The danger is all around and nobody can do anything about it. Otherwise, "Magnolia" is about the lives we all actually live.Like I said: Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been meaning to see Magnolia for the longest time, and I just rented it tonight. It was the weirdest, most random, most amazing and simply the coolest film I have ever seen. I was so amazed at the intricate plots and characters. It makes me wonder how directors and writers like P.T. Anderson come up with stuff like that... that takes an amazing amount of talent and a really passionate and interesting way of looking at the world. I thought it was fascinating how he dissected the characters' relationships with each other, their relationships with themselves, and the commentary it made on society as a whole.Towards the beginning of the movie, a friend who was watching it with me commented (during one of Tom Cruise's speeches), "That's like everything that's wrong with our society." As the film wore on, that became more and more pervasive as we watched these characters' downward spiral, with only some to be lifted back up again.I also really loved the idea that everything happens for a reason, and by the end of the film we have thoroughly explored each character's psyche and we realize why they act the way they do. I especially loved Tom Cruise's character's breakdown at the end of the film.The few things I'm still not clear on... Why the title, "Magnolia?" I didn't pick up on any references to it during the movie. I'm also not sure if the frogs were supposed to be a plague like the obvious reference to the bible, or cathartic like some reviewers have suggested.This movie was nothing I have ever seen before, which makes it a great work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls flat of director's obvious goal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is *exactly* the type of film that I love. Intertwining lives and the psychological consequences. However, I found this film actually fell a little flat. It had an absolutely Great beginning. It had a pretty good ending. The cast was good. Tom Cruise puts in the most amazing performance of his career to date. But the entire long middle ... it was a struggle to sit through it all. I had to fight off urges to give up on it, or fast forward to the end. The film did not grip me, and I simply failed to find any character to connect to. The director was trying very hard to build it up as "coincidental meetings" and their affect on lives ...but it just didn't reach past that normal-movie-characters interacting with each other level. There didn't seem to be anything too terribly coincidental about it. The closest you come is a meeting of a cop with a druggie. Both "main" characters and that One is happenstance enough to land on the "coincidental" level. Just one. To me, a good example of coincidental movie character moments is a scene in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" in which main characters from two seperate plot lines accidentally get photo's mixed up at a booth. That's good coincidence. A different example would be Mike Figgis' "Timecode", in which many characters interact with each other as they pass by each other, several of which you would not have guessed knew each other until they interact.Magnolia ? Something in their interactions just "falls flat" of that coincidence line. However, there are some very powerful scenes, mostly near the end. All in all, the film is worth the rental price just to see Tom Cruise show us he can actually act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I was leery of renting this film as I was under the impression the screen-time would be consumed by the megalomaniacal misogynist character of Frank T.J. Mackey. Luckily this was not so. Within 15 minutes we are introduced to all the main characters and the confusing, 24-hour journey begins. Magnolia deals largely with two themes: the "return of the past" and the anguish suffered at the hands of fathers -- abuse, betrayal, infidelity, etc. We see how the characters are all haunted by the unresolved issues in their past. "We may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us."P.T.A decides to have fun with the audience -- he fills the movie with symbolism, irony and some not-so-subtle nudges and winks. One particular scene that pairs irony with a nudge and a wink, is when the male nurse is trying to contact Tom Cruise's character, letting him know that his estranged father is dying. The dialogue goes something like this:"It's like one of those scenes from a movie, only this is real. Now I know why they put them in movies, because they ARE real."Anderson amuses his-self by toying with the audience. He teases us with a flash-card (as seen in the audience of "What do Kids Know") which reads Exodus 8:2 and a note on a painting which reads: "it really did happen". Both are meant to explain the baffling precipitation of amphibians that ensues.The title of Magnolia, while not directly referenced in the film, does reference other flowers -- two in the form of female characters -- Rose and Lily. Rose, the supportive wife of an abusive and disloyal husband, represents love, respect and courage. Lily, the late wife of (the dying) Earl Partridge, represents the return of happiness.I would award this film an 8/10. It loses 1 point for the disgusting downpour of frogs and another point for forcing the cast take turns singing Mann's "Wise Up".Magnolia takes some effort to watch -- not only is it exceedingly long (over 3 hours) but the plots are confoundedly intertwined (a la Pulp Fiction). But what makes it oh-so-worth watching is the undeniably superb acting. It is also a "smart" film -- it leaves you with a lot to think about. One could easily re-watch this film just to catch and try to understand all it's nuances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unquestionably moving and brilliant, even if...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, before I start listing all the good things about the movie Magnolia, and believe me, there are many, I will list the things that are potentially bad about the movie, and get them out of the way. It's often self-indulgent and self-important. It contains one too many confessions of spousal cheating. It can be argued that the movie gets downright cheesy at some times--like when they all start singing the soundtrack song "Wise Up" by Aimee Mann, and maybe there are some aspects of the plot (the prophetic kid rapper, just what DOES William H. Macy do for a living?) go unexplained or unjustified, and you either will love or hate the finale. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to say that Magnolia is one of the most moving movies of all time. There is a quiet yearning always apparent in the movie--some people say it is a movie about misery, but I don't believe it's quite that--I think it's a movie about wasted lives, the lives of people who just need to get over their sense of regret before they can make something of their lives. More than one character says in the movie "we may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us," and for almost every character in the movie it is a definitive quote. Here is the plotline in as few words and most connections as possible. Earl (Jason Robards) is a dying TV producer, cared for by a male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Earl left his wife years ago when she developed cancer for the younger Linda (Julianne Moore), leaving his son Frank (Tom Cruise) to look after his mother, and Frank became an on-TV sex guru, preaching his "seduce and destroy" method to millions of followers. Produced by Earl is the TV show "What Do Kids Know," a show whose returning champion is the young boy Stanley (Jeremy Blackman), a boy who is sick of being looked upon as a freak and sick of his father (Michael Bowen) and the pressure he puts upon him. Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) was the champ on the show about 30 years ago, but is now a grown-up failure who resorts to robbing his own store when things get rough. The host of the show is Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall), who is also dying and wants his beloved wife Rose (Melinda Dillon) and abused, drug-addicted daughter Cluadia (Melora Walters) to forgive him before he dies. Neither of them seem to, especially Claudia, who seems to now be leading a sleazy lifestyle of drugs and sex until she is visited by good-hearted, religious policeman Jim (John C. Reily), who instantly falls for her, and just could be the source of her redemption. If it sounds like a lot to take in, remember the movie's 3-hour running length. For a movie that is 3 hours long, though, it flies instantly by. Several people on this site were complaining of it being sooo lonnnngggg, but I was constantly glancing at my watch, and hoping that I still had a good amount of time before the movie was over--much like the 1993 ensemble piece "Short Cuts," I didn't want it to end, I wanted to learn more about these characters, I wanted them to find happiness. Quite needless to say, the performances across the board are quite excellent. Though Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall might not get much of a chance to act through their confessional time, they get the job done. Julianne Moore and Melinda Dillon are pretty good as their wives. But the performances only get better from there. As the two quiz champions, Jeremy Blackman is truly wonderful and William H. Macy is at his nervous best. But then we get to the three performances that make this one of the best ensemble casts since "Pulp Fiction". Melora Waters's absolutely heartbreaking performance as the doomed Claudia is one the viewer is not likely to forget. Tom Cruise does maybe his best dramatic work so far here--when he is on stage, he's on fire, and could easily be a preacher preaching his religion, and to some extent, he is, but his too best moments come when he tells the reporter that's interviewing him "I'm quietly judging you," and when he half laughs/breaks down at his dying father's bedside, truly a matured performance that the star of "Cocktail" could not have given. But the performance to watch here is John C. Reily's, as the centerpiece of the movie, the voice of reason, the voice of goodness among the disappointment, the do-gooder cop who just wants to help people. Maybe less showy than Cruise's role, but just as emotionally powerful. He pulls it off with such a sense of reality that we pray for his safety and pray for his happiness. It is brilliantly directed by P.T. Anderson. Often compared to one of Altman's multi-charactered mosaics, Anderson's technique could not really be much more different. Altman's direction always gave his character pieces a sort of distanced, alienated feel, but Anderson's here is very intimate. Characters are given slow close-ups, or are slowly followed as they move, or sometimes when you see two characters talking, you will only actually see one of the characters and try to guess what they are thinking. The story is well written and the stories all well connected, and the ending...well, as I said, you either love it or hate it. I loved it. If you asked me to explain the meaning of it, whether it was a biblical metaphor, or a chance for self-reflection for the characters, or what, I could not tell you. But it hit an appropriate emotional nerve for the time, and in the cold world of 90's movies, why not? Maybe it was a plot device, but if so, a very, very powerful one. And the music, let's not forget Aimee Mann (who'da thunk it? The lead singer of the 80's onehitwonder band 'Til Tuesday comes back out to write the most appropriate soundtrack to a movie since The Graduate?) and her hauntingly correct songs. "Save Me" is one of the true highlights of the movie--an aching, desperate cry for what everyone in the movie seems to be searching for.See Magnolia. If you were more bored than I was, I'm sorry. You're missing an experience unlike really any other.</fullReview>

I told my wife to expect some amazing but true devt at the end that would bring the story together; and we speculated and speculated but for whatever reason did not guess that frogs would suddenly fall from the sky. I don't insist that the story line be resolved at the conclusion but the prologue promised more than the film delivered. The 2 prologue stories appeared to be historical but it is presumably impossible (!) for frogs to simply begin to splatter everything in sight. Maybe I am a poop but I felt cheated. I am happy enough with Euro style movies that are ironic or leave the viewer hanging but the prologue and frogs seemed gratuitous touches that detracted from the absorbing storylines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a great fan of P T Anderson after watching the stunning "Boogie Nights" and the low-key "Hard Eight", I waited with mounting anticipation for the release of "Magnolia". I wasn`t to be disappointed.It starts hesitantly with a strange prologue about the nature of co-incidences and fate, before each character is introduced by an Aimee Mann song. There`s failed "quiz-kid" Donnie, moralistic cop Jim, dying TV producer Earl and a host of other intriguing people. The depth and pain of these characters only begins to emerge slowly over the next 3 hours, and these initial sketches are filled out to tragic and hopeful climaxes. Essentially, this is a tragic tale, illustrating the pain and hurt at the centre of so many lives. Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) is a much-loved veteran quiz-show presenter, who has a dark shadow hanging over his geniality. His daughter Claudia (Melora Walters) has a long-hidden secret that is slowly destroying her life and sanity. She meets moralizing cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) after he questions her at her apartment. Jim seems "straight" and "together" to the screwed up Claudia but he is riven by self-doubt and loneliness, clinging to his moral beliefs for dear life. Their hesitant courtship is heartbreakingly rendered by the two stunning actors (who must surely go on to larger roles). Earl Partridge (the late, great Jason Robards)is dying, with his wife Linda (Julianne Moore...excellent as ever) starting to have a breakdown. He is estranged from his famous son,controversial sex therapist Frank Mackey. Tom Cruise`s portrayal of this egotistical monster is a masterpiece; however following the running theme, he eventually reveals his weakness and pain. He too, is the same as the rest of us...This is a once in a blue moon masterpiece, that left me breathless at the end. By the end, you develop a real empathy for the characters, and in particular the moral compass of Jim Kurring. PT Anderson throws in a remarkable ending that quite possibly is the strangest twists in a serious film ever, and along with the touching singing interlude mid-film (which involves all the major characters) reveals his position as one of the the most innovative directors working today. He is the true heir to the 70`s greats. An unabashed, unashamed 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Human epic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his third film, Paul Thomas Anderson has accomplished the rare. He has made a true Human epic. Robert Altman's Nashville is the epitome of this 'genre', but Magnolia (and perhaps Soderbergh's Traffic, which I have yet to see) are shining examples of what can be achieved when throwing a handfull of people together. Meet Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise), a sex guru who's carefully constructed past is about to be blown in his face by a reporter (April Grace). Meet Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), a brilliant child who's pushed to the limit by his overbearing father (Michael Bowen). Meet Mackey's father (Jason Robards- in his last film performance), a bedridden dying movie mogul who's desperate to see his son before he dies, while his trophy wife (Julianne Moore) is closer to the edge of despair then before, using pills to ease her pain. Meet Jim Kuring (John C. Reilly), who's need for love is so great, he falls in love with Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters), a woman trying to remain sane while her body screams for drugs. Meet her father, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), the quiz show host on Stanley's show, meet Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), former Quiz kid. This is a movie that takes a leap into the operatic. Championing extroversion and ignoring the irony that plagued the nineties, Anderson assembles a magnificent cast and explores a story full of coincidence and ambition. He lets his cast free, and they give us glorious performances. At the head of the list are Tom Cruise, Melora Walters, and Julianne Moore. Cruise deserved the oscar for a brilliant turn as the sex guru who's visage is slowly destroyed. Walters and Moore give career defining performances (what a year for Moore!). The nervousness they share is underlined by their need for drugs. There are scenes that are so rare for a film, that they defy reason. The cast singing 'Wise Up' was not cheesy and out of place as some suspected, but a touching addition. And the frog scene was incredible and very funny. Aimee Mann's songs work very well with the film as well as on their own. I did think American Beauty was a better film, but Anderson's operatic and ambitious epic was a film where the tagline 'Look Closer' was one that could be identified with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read these comments quite often and I have to say that the PTAnderson film Magnolia must have something going for it, ifjudged only by the many insightful comments I've seen (positiveand negative.) With the exception of the guy who botches up whatStanislavski was trying to tell actors, I read very few comments thatweren't heart felt and passionate. And I think the director wouldprobably be pretty satisfied with that. I found this movie and it's characters aggravating and repetitive attimes and I did feel as if I was being banged over the head with anot too subtle message. There were times I wanted to beg theactors to just get on with it and quit wallowing in emotion. Even inthe rather animated moments of the Tom Cruise character'sseminars, I felt a little like, "Okay, we believe that you're a pretty vileguy, now tell us something we don't know." But this movie keeps coming at you. And I think that might be the point. If you hear a line like, "We mightbe through with the past, but the past isn't through with us," onetime, you might think, "hmmm, nice little line." When you hear itthree times and you are given three hours and countless, wellwritten examples of how that plays out, you are literally forced tothink about what it means in your life. Seeing every charactermouth the words "it's not gonna change, until you wise up," is likehaving the director refuse to let you off the hook until you at leastconsider the idea. In some ways, I think this is one of the bravest attempts I've everseen at asking an audience just what the hell we are doing withour lives and also letting us know that there might be hope. Somemay take that as sitting in moral judgment of society, but I for oneappreciate the guy for having the balls to give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have thrown money away before, but this really hurt. I don't want my 8 bucks back nearly as much as I want those 3 and one half hours back in my life. I was at the movies staring at the screen with incredulity, and all i could think was that I wasted 8.50 on this piece of celluloid refuse. I felt more sorry for these two elderly women who looked back at me with confusion, seeking an explanation of what incontinent drivel they had just witnessed. I could not help these poor women and felt really bad for them since I know they must be on a fixed income and shelled out cash for this THIRD effort by a talented writer director, who has two awesome films under his belt.

		<shortDescription>Existential Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw Magnolia in a theater, which was a much better experience, but then I saw it again on video, and still really liked it. In retrospect, I think Magnolia was the best picture of 1999 and should have won that Oscar, better than American Beauty (alright, I don't really like Kevin Spacey) or Being John Malkovich (which I enjoyed, but Being John is surrealist and didn't say a lot to me). Of course, though, I like avant garde movies. What strikes me most about reading the other reviews here is that I now evidently understand this movie in a different way than anyone else, I think, and than I did before. Granted, I had a hint in seeing P.T. Anderson talking about Magnolia on Charlie Rose, saying Magnolia is about "redemption" blah blah blah. But while the movie does in part show how lives are interconnected, it seems to me what Magnolia is really about is how people are selfish and thereby mess up other people's lives around them. The plea of this movie is "It's not going to stop . . . until you wise up," and start behaving better, and think about the effects of your actions on other lives. Admittedly, with less skillful execution, this could be trite and heavy-handed, but the film's dark reality manages to shock, surprise and disorient the viewer enough, that we almost forget that's what it's about. It's really not a bad theme when you think about it. It's about the meaning of life.I have to admit what I like most about Magnolia is mood and technique, rather than acting or character, and the way it tries to break from convention: the long continuous camera shots (Goodfellas, Swingers), the music video-esque editing, the existential L.A. winter rain and clouds. Sort of like a kaleidescope of Greek tragedies. I sincerely hope no animals were hurt during the making of the film. What impressed me most is the way Magnolia just keeps on coming at you for three hours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Magnolia in the theater, and liked it then, especially the strange yet meaningful twists and surprises towards the end. After seeing it on video, I liked it even more, and was more appreciative of the story and script, the way the various separate stories eventually linked together, the unusual set-up by the narrator at the start of the movie regarding the three strange "coincidence? I think not!" true stories. The acting was superb. I've seen accolades for Tom Cruise and others, but what about the guy who played the nurse, Phil? Or John C. Reilly as the squeaky-clean, so-decent-it-can't-be cop? They are the two most beautiful people in the movie. But, in watching the video, I finally found myself having sympathy for all the others -- the whacked out coke-addict, the grieving wife, the two dying fathers, and especially for the grown-up Wiz Kid who is "just plain stupid now". I can understand why some people will find the unbelievable sing-along, followed by an even more unbelievable "rainstorm" -- they will find these too extreme or off-putting. But you have to understand the whole magnolia concept -- separate petals, one flower --, and you have to put that in context with the opening sequence about the "coincidence? I think not?" stories. In short, we are all connected, in one way or the other, and things that happen to some of us, often affect all of us. A fascinating, unique story, and it kept me glued to it throughout my second viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't gotten around to seeing "Magnolia" when it was in the theatres, but I'd heard some good things about it. I was not prepared for the depth of vision and strength that the combination of the script, cinematography, music underscore, art direction and directing that vision film-maker Anderson has pulled together in this film. The DVD presentation is also a beaut! Two discs (one completely filled with background material) and a video transfer than simply shines! The performances by William H. Macy (and real-life spouse Felicity Huffman as a relatively minor character), the incredible Jason Robards, totally surprising Tom Cruise (an intensity he probably hasn't reached in years), the incredibly talented Julianne Moore. Add to these, terrific supporting performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall and even Henry Gibson (remember him from "Laugh In"?) and you've got a rollicking romp of a film.Just when you think the ending is heading for some sort of wild conclusion, Anderson takes a wild left turn (don't give it away!) and the film leaves you slack-jawed. This is what film-making is all about!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson, the writer/director of this film is without a doubt a talented man. His stories are different, and he has the ability to tell them excitingly.Magnolia is an entertaining film - a story about characters who have real depth. The audience can really relate to them, as they are portrayed by gifted actors. Especially Tom Cruise makes his performance worthy of the Academy Award-nomination which he earned from this film.The film itself runs a little over 180 minutes. It kicks off with pace and sustains it for a surprisingly long time. The characters are introduced to us pretty fast, a lot of things seem to be going on. Magnolia has a good sense of pace, but still, it seems to lose it every once in a while. Fortunately it doesn't slow down for too long - there's always something going on, some other storyline to follow when the one at hand starts to lose grip.I don't want to give away anything about the story itself, but if you're looking for a film which moves you, this is a good choice. Romance, action, comedy, drama... Magnolia has it all. The best things about it are the absolutely stunning actors, wonderful story and emotional songs written by Aimee Mann. I recommend Magnolia to all who like stories about people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a step down for the director Paul Thomas Anderson, I think. His original intent was to follow up Boogie Nights with a smaller film more in the vein of his first film, Hard 8 or Sydney. That would have been the wiser decision than to create this gargantuan monstrosity. It's longer than Boogie Nights but has much, much less narrative drive. There really is very little plot for all that running time.Obviously the focus is intended to be on the characters instead of plot. But do we really care about these characters? I think what we sort of have here is two groups of characters who are only tangentially related and it would have been better to strip out one or the other. We have the "family unit" centering around Jason Robards and the "family unit" centered around Philip Baker Hall. If you eliminated the Robards family you would have a shorter and tighter movie and keep the most interesting and likeable characters and performances. What is the connection between the two family groups, anyway? There really isn't any I can recall besides a chance encounter with the black kid who interacts with both groups.Centering upon the Baker Hall family would have allowed an actual plot driven narration, too. The game show would have given the movie the narrative drive it desperately needs.This film runs afoul of the Interiors principle. namely, when you create a character driven piece you should really have characters the audience cares about, not just characters they feel pity for. The sympathetic characters, though, are the secondary ones: the male nurse, the child genius, the cop. Boogie Nights centered on a character we were interested in and cared about. But if the main characters are just pitiful and tragic then it's a real chore to sit through three hours about them, no matter what happens at the end.About the end? What does it mean? Is it an example of randomness taking on the appearance of order or order taking on the appearance of randomness? You know, that's an appropriate question for the whole movie, come to think of it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it difficult to rate this movie. I wasn't sure whether to give it a 6 or an 8 (in the event I voted 7). On the negative side it's too long (3 hours), it lacks pace and it's confusing. On the plus side it's interesting, it's serious, the acting is great and it leaves an impression. It seems to me that this movie is about the randomness of life. Things happen (or don't) for no particular reason. It's also about the mistakes that we make in our lives - and forgiveness - or the lack of it. And it's about death. I guess what you take from the film depends on your personal opinions but I took from it that at the end of your life there should be forgiveness - no matter what you've done. Some people have described this movie as "arty" and "pretentious". It's not - unless your idea of serious drama is Toy Story. It just tells an interesting story about ordinary people - but it takes too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia - interesting but flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia, which is set in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley,chronicles a brief period in the lives of several inter-connected characters.Paul Thomas Anderson once again shows himself to be a director who possesses not just a great sense of style and flair, but who is able to bring out great performances from his actors.However, in spite of the strengths of the film it failed to move or involve me in the way that I hoped it would.Most of the characters depicted are emotionally unstable or repressed, and over the course of the film events conspire to bring all of these feelings and conflicts to a head. Handled differently this basic premise might have made for a more engaging and moving experience. However, throughout the course of the three hour plus running time the extreme emotional intensity of the characters is too often on show. As such, in the same way that one might become de-sensitized to violent acts in a film which is full of violence so I found myself becoming de-sensitized to the plight of the characters.Boogie Nights was in some respects a similar film - i.e. similar cast, similar style in terms of direction and photography - however, it differed from Magnolia in that there was a single character at the heart of the film. Dirk Diggler's rise and fall in the Porn industry gave Boogie Nights an emotional arc which Magnolia lacked. Magnolia started to close to full throttle and tried to maintain the same level of emotional intensity for too long. Perhaps with fewer characters and a more measured build up Magnolia would have been a better film.In spite of its drawbacks, the acting, the direction and the remarkable climax make this a film which is worth seeing. However, I hope that on his next project PTA adopts a story which has a structure and pace more closely resembling that of Boogie Nights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is such a great film I don't know where to start. First it's great to see a film that pulls out all the stops and goes where it wants to go. It's a film thats on such a human level that everytime I watch it I understand something more about what life is like. There are ups, and then there are downs. There are times where we can't "control" whats going on. I think that some people overlook that "control of our fate" plays a big factor in the film. We try to control death with drugs to hold on (both men who are near death drink or take drugs to help them). We try to control our kids to make them something we want them to be (the dad forcing the kid to be on the gameshow because he isn't as smart). We try to control our work (both the cop when he loses the gun, and T.J. when he tries to stay in control of the interview).I can see why there is a love/hate relationship about the film. Yes it's long but you need it to be long to deal with everything that goes on. Plus some don't understand the frogs, which I can understand because I didn't at first until I looked at the begining again, and then to the many times that the bible is stated. It's all about things that are out of our control that maybe God has control of.Paul Thomas Anderson has made, along with Boogie Nights, two of the greatest films of the 90's. Magnolia is the last great film of the 90's, and the century. Paul Thomas should get an award for being the best new filmmaker to come along in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It always amazes me how critics eat up films like this. Talky, yawnfests about extremely uninteresting characters who spout the least compelling dialogue you could imagine. "Pulp Fiction" sort of began the latest trend near the mid 90s and I thought Anderson did a great job in making a better version of Tarentino's film because he managed to keep the events and characters interesting in "Boogie Nights". Not that it wouldn't be tough to have sex and stardom be engrossing for 2 and a half hours, but he really did a bang up job with it. A lot of the echoes of that film are here: pounding music, the camera constantly racing up right into the characters face, etc. Here he reverts back to my least favorite: "Tarentino" style filmmaking, by showcasing a bunch of dullards going through chaotic lives. Why he feels it neccessary to have EVERY one of his characters (children included) constantly blast obscenities is beyond me. And who knows why so many would praise his storylines and not be utterly bored is even more beyond me. Can critics actually honestly say that if they were sitting next to these people in a restaurant and evesdropping that they wouldn't give a rat's patoot about them after listening for more than a minute? It would be an interesting experiment and definitely a better idea for a movie than this.We follow the life of a cop, a coke head, a game show host, a whiz kid, his demanding dad, a former whiz kid, a neurotic mess, her dying husband, his macho, relationship guru son, his father's caretaker, gee, I think thats all of them (sheesh). The Cruise character, though the only one of interest, is not as great as he's made out to be. Cruise was praised for his performance, just because he gives some pumped up line readings of sexually graphic dialogue we've never heard him do before. And his bedside crying in the end goes on so long and looks so dopey, that the fast forward button became very handy. Tack on one of the all time STUPIDEST endings ever and you've got a dud for the ages. I'm all for something unique and crazy that comes out of nowhere in a film, but please keep it within the realm of reality that you started with. Ugghhh, this is three hours of sleep-inducement. To say the least.</fullReview>

I found myself, after two and a half hours, waiting for a huge ending in which an act of coincidence brought everyone together. Unfortunately, the amphibians didn't cut the mustard.At the end of the film, you couldn't help but feel a little empty with regards to certain incidents and the generally lacklustre finale.Unanswered questions: Amphibians (Biblical or coincidental?) Kid rapper (Con man or controller of all events?) Note on the Screamer painting (Subtle hint or slap in the face?)The performances were all of high quality ranging from Moore's slightly overzealous desperate junkie to Cruise's outstanding chauvinist pig.Definitely worth a view, but probably not repeated viewings.80%</fullReview>

However, he's one of the 'edgy' Hollywood writers these days who shows how in touch he is with reality and the people he routinely degrades by the number of times he can use the f-word in any situation, even if used by children, older people, etc.. Complete character disconnect. And forget continuity or arc. Since this dwells on depression, sadness, and hopelessnes, of course this is one of the top 250 movies of all time, along with Pulp Fiction and its like. Hollywood's current love affair with degraded plots doesn't excuse poor storytelling and precious gimmicks, esp. the preposterous finale (no, "it doesn't happen" -- only in Hollyweird). This movie is over three hours of pretentiousness that you could have better spent helping out at the homeless shelter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should give a warning for films this long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend and I went to Magnolia to kill a cloudy Sunday afternoon. It had come out in the international film fest and stayed on at the theatres, so we decided it must be something worth seeing -right? Well, I think all in all it probably WAS, but only just. First of all, they should give a warning for any movie that's over 2 hours long, along with the age restriction warning. Bring back intermissions!! We weren't prepared for the length of this film, and were waiting and waiting for the Big Ending to come throughout the last half of the movie. The thing is, it never does. Sure there is the 'Event', but the film could just as well have ended anywhere from half-way through the film onwards. When the credits finally roll there is no sense of closure, no feeling of being uplifted or moved that comes with a good film. I agree with what others have said regarding the storyline, which begins by teasing us that the theme of 'coincidence' will somehow tie things up at the end, but then it never does. Sure some of the characters cross paths, or are revealed to be in some kind of relationship with one another, but at the end other characters are just left hanging, and we're left wondering what the point of that little 'coincidence' theme intro ever was! The 'Event' for all its glory only partly redeems the disappointing ending, because by the time we made it to the 'Event' we had been ready to leave for about an hour.The most moving scene was definitely Tom Cruise dealing with his conflicting emotions he gave a fantastic performance and really pulled it off. In fact all of the performances were good, but the plot and structure just did not do these characters any justice. Boogie Nights was definitely better - what a great ending!</fullReview>

Most of the characters are fascinating, and ultimately there are maybe too many stories going on. The movie is in some ways a disappointment, but it's worth seeing for some individual scenes and knockout performances (Tom Cruise got an Oscar nomination and a lot of attention for his role, but the rest of the cast is just as good if not better, especially Julianne Moore, Jason Robards and William H.

		<fullReview>Magnolia is audacious, and in my opinion, one of the few films that is better viewed on home video. It takes risks with structure and characterization that can at times leave the viewer breathless, whispering "no...way!" under his or her breath. Take a portion, and absorb it at your own pace. Then continue on for more.To watch Magnolia is to see the results of "American Beauty" and "Happiness" shattered and reassembled into a singular vision by a cinematic Picasso. Unlike the former, Magnolia resists the temptation to paint its characters in monochromatic tones of black and white. And in contrast to the latter, it offers its characters (and us) hope for redemption, of moving forward in the present by obliterating the dark shadows of one's past by bringing them fully to light.Think of the closing scene from Coppola's "The Godfather,Part II." The camera moves in on Michael, his soul stripped raw, now the unchallenged ruler supreme who has achieved all at the price of losing all. He has gone over the brink on which the characters of Magnolia teeter. They too are stripped raw, but they remain connected with the larger, collective forces of humanity. It is this connection that saves them in the end.</fullReview>

There were a half-dozen sub plots that had to eventually tie together somehow, but I guess that made it kind of interesting. I loved the music, but then I was already a fan of Aimee Mann. Overall I am torn as to whether it was worth watching for three hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional Manipulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia was one of the most emotionally manipulative movies I've ever seen. There wasn't one person you could relate to (unless you're a social deviant). They were all f----- up and pathetic. The film was saved by a few shining performances, that of Cruise and Jason Robards. I adore Julianne Moore but her pathetic whining and inability to get a grip was annoying. Her constant attempts at self-destruction really lost their effect. And that whole concept of how incidents and people are related was so over-dramatized and over-wrought.Anderson's style here is being compared to Altman. No one does Altman like Altman. He can tell you more about a person's psyche in a few minutes of evesdropping on a conversation without having to manipulate the audience. Director P.T. Anderson's Boogie Nights was a much finer film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pseudo-artsy-fartsy trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was shallow pseudo-art in my opinion with some "insights" which are already obvious to the thinking person. Where's the symbolism in the magnolia or is it ridiculously arbitrary? Just like "Boogie Nights" the focus was primarily on pitiful people and had very little real message. The nature of relationships (an overused topic) and pure shock value seemed to be the hook of the movie, much like a Jerry Springer show - chaotic and pointless besides the obvious. For this reason I found this film emotionally and philosophically immature. I, too worry about the people who liked it. I bet they didn't understand American Beauty, which had souls that were better entertwined and a much better painting of the true nature of American life, portrayed in a simple yet deeply meaningful way. The chaos and the characters in this movie to me did not come together in a meaningful way. Although the characters in this film and in Boogie Nights may have been based on the dark side of reality, they were exaggerated and did not seem realistic in and of themselves or believable. Every character was simply "crazy". Tom Cruise was the exception in believability, as he really got to show off his acting chops - he has improved and matured immensely since his Top Gun years - impressive performance. Still, his character was not a realistic one. Perhaps he was a symbol of an ideology, whereas the drug-addicted female characters were symbols of an absence of ideology. I suspect that P.T. Anderson is a misogynist himself and I'm not interested in watching him play out his parental "issues", which were obvious by the double father-estrangement and the weak and negative way in which the women were portrayed. I have decided that P.T. Anderson is a terribly self-indulgent director with little to offer the people in the way of meaning or insight. Only stupid people would like this movie or Boogie Nights, which are nothing more than shallow entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to renting this movie.I found the first hour of the movie to be moderatly interesting. I found the second hour of the movie to be dull and lifeless. After that I shut it off.I debated if I should turn it off or not, because I know that at some point during the last hour of the movie all of the storylines would tie together. And for all I know that tieing up could be very interesting.Unfortunitaly I just couldn't drag myself thru the movie anymore. I regret this a little bit. But ultimately I just couldn't overcome the boredom that was setting in after watching a semi-interesting, mostly dull movie for two hours.Maybe the ending was fabulous! I'll never know. If a three hour and ten minute movie cant keep me interested for the first two hours, then I'll scrap the last hour, no matter how good it is.I will rate this movie a 5. This falls below the IMDb minimum 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow.... Just watched 'Magnolia'. Hmmm, well... the movie starts out showing 3 (I think it was 3) 'stories' of strange coincidences. Things that are completely freak like Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln, etc, etc. From there, the viewer is geared up for some kind of 'like' situation(s) in the film. Not to happen. Not sure why this was here..... A couple of characters met up with each other, but not as one might imagine based upon the film's opening scene's.After the opening scene we are introduced to the 'cast' of characters in short little bits of their 'lives' as Aimee Mann sings (IMHO 'awful') a version of 'one' by the monkey's or something, that went on and on and on.... and more offensive was the mix to where this tune is at the same volume of the dialog, making it difficult to hear a good deal of this opening 'presentation' of the main characters. 'One' was an appropriate choice of song lyric, as unknown to the movie viewer, you were about to sit through 2.5 hrs or something of people and their melancholy lives and the ways in which they became the 'one' of the title tune. This will not be a movie of smiles for movie goers.You find yourself jumping from one story to the next in each 'life' of the characters (not hard to follow or disrupting) with a dialog tract of worn out F* words and GD*it's, etc. At the conclusion of the first 45 minutes, the edge of any of the dialog is uninteresting due to the overuse of the profanities. (such dialog does have it's place in context, but but the excessive use shows lazy writing and low inspiration from the script authors.There's a good chance that each and every individual left the theater feeling worse about things and their lives than before they went in. On the other hand, a movie like this perhaps does have it's place out there, with whom, I have no idea. As the movie progresses, things only get worse as a number of the main characters 'lives' become typical and at times a little weird.A number of themes run in this movie from drug addiction, to runaway fathers, to strange civil servants. The majority of this film is depressing, long, boring, drawn out, unpromising, dull and worth renting another title instead of. This viewer walked away wondering what in the world the director was trying to tell 'us' in this movie, and why any of it was important. Ultimately, when the half point is reached, fast forward to the end while looking for the interesting parts to fill out the main storyline. A majority of the dialog is needless. What or anything in this movie was entertaining or had anything of value is beyond the scope of this critic. But it was loaded with common depressing life situations, average acting, and uninteresting plots for those who like that kind of thing.Perhaps this director does have something to say, and has something of interest to offer the general public, but this does not seem to be the case for the mainstream movie viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was pieced together perfectly. Thats not an easy job for a three hour movie. Evrything fits to gether in the end and I was glad I had seen it despite what some people say. It is about a bunch of people in California and their lives. They are all having problems and have to face them. Tom Cruis hides from his problems by pretending to be some big sexis tough guy. William H. Macy, in a great performance, is an alcoholic who is pathetic has been. He hides his problems throwing his money away to impress some bar tender. He thinks this will bring him happiness. "I have love to give, and I WILL be good to you!" he screams. These are just two of the many stories. What makes this movie great is that it leaves you to wonder so much. Also the performances are absolutly terific by the entire cast. Especialy by Willam Macy, Julian Moore, John C. Riely, and most of all Phylip Seymore Hoffman who almost stole every scene he was in.P. S. The greatest scene, in my opinion is where they are all singing. Watch Macy's eyes! What a great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 1999!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget "American Beauty." Nothing comes close to the magnificent director/writer's vision of life in the San Fernando Valley. "Magnolia" is the best film of 1999! With an outstanding cast, great songs, and an awesome and inspiring director, "Magnolia" ranks it up there as NUMBER 4 on my favourite pictures of all time.I like Paul Thomas Anderson because of his first shots into a film. "Boogie Night's" first opening shot was amazing - how it swooped in to show the name, characters and more. "Magnolia" is like that, showing each character in the matter of three minutes behind Aimee Mann's version of "One."Paul Thomas Anderson uses complex characters again to create a dramatic and emotional picture that every can love. Because of its many characters, there's one that you'll fall in love with. Not one story over powers the other. With GREAT PERFORMANCES from Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore (my personal favourite,) Jason Robards (very, very nice,) John C. Reilly and Melora Walters.Magnolia, even though it's three hours long, is the best film of 1999. 10 out of 10 stars. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!</fullReview>

If you enjoy reading the kind of novel that seems to be written mainly for the purpose of hectoring the reader into accepting the novelist's worldview then you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you don't, then you probably won't. For me it way exceeded the annoyance quotient I'm prepared to allow movies... it's well over three hours long, and it had thoroughly aggravated me by about the 40 minute point. Aimee Mann's music is excellent... but it's diminished by association with this film. My advice - skip the movie, buy the album.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Buildup to a Disappointing Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I didn't get the opportunity of seeing this movie in theaters, so I had been anticipating it's arrival on video for weeks. I loved Boogie Nights, and I love Fiona Apple's music videos, but this is P.T. Anderson's single worst accomplishment to date and I shudder to think that he was nominated for an Academy Award for it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad, but it certainly isn't even an eighth as good as Boogie Nights (which for some reason ISN'T EVEN IN THE TOP 250!?! Why is this movie among the top 50, but Boogie Nights isn't even in the top 250!?!) I loved the first 2 1/2 hours of the movie, and I figured that there'll probably be some great conclusion. But there isn't. I can't even begin to explain how dumb this ending is. And he uses the ridiculous ending to tie the movie back to the beginning (and let's face it, the ending is far stranger than any of the short stories at the beginning, so it doesn't really fit in at all.) Then, after the frogs, he gives each character's situation a less-than-mediocre conclusion. You can't just have it rain frogs, and end the movie. The frogs seem to just be an excuse to end the movie because he can't seem to find a way to conclude his movie. I'm sure he had it thought out that way (to end with the frogs) from the very beginning, but I don't think he realized how excruciatingly long his movie turned out to be. If the movie had been only 1 1/2 long, the ending would've been satisfying and since the ending is so bizarre that it's funny, the movie still would've been good. But the movie was so excruciatingly long, that the conclusion he gave me just wasn't enough to satisfy me. The ending ruined the rest of the movie for me. The first 2 1/2 hours of the movie were good, but the ending wasn't at all satisfying. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Point of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look through the reviews of this movie and I feel like I got something out of this movie that no one else has stated; I feel like the message of the movie has eluded most people. Here's what I thought the movie was about:One of the worst sins a person can commit is to harm, neglect or treat our children as anything less than precious. Child abuse, in all its forms, is a pollution of our future and it will become apparent to us one day; the effects are still manifesting and will some day come to a head. We will then become aware of what we've done as the consequences break loose like a plague.I see the movie giving numerous demonstrations of how children are being ruined, have been ruined, will be ruined. I was impressed on how the cascade of poison was shown to pass from one generation to the next, from one public speaker to many listeners. I felt like the only thing that bordered on preachy was the music's lyrics ("It's not going to stop, 'til you wise up"); otherwise the movie made it's point in a documentary-like style.</fullReview>

It's difficult to dismiss entirely, because there are some genuinely talented people at work here -- William H. Macy, for instance, could read binary code and make it interesting. But before a frame of film was shot, somebody should have made P.T. Anderson understand that his script was nearly twice as long as the material merited. High school sophomores will no doubt be dazzled by the obvious symbolism and superficial "complexity" of the characters; the rest of us will recognize "Magnolia" as a largely self-indulgent misfire.</fullReview>

Transcending anything he has done before and firmly earning a place among the great filmmakers of our time.

Wonderful ensemble acting from an incredible cast including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, John C Reily, Phillip Baker Hall, Tom Cruise, Henry Gibson, William H Macy, Alfred Molina and of course the great Jason Robards.

		<shortDescription>You got to see it just for the frogs. (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAGNOLIA seems initially to proclaim itself as an, admittedly brilliant, derivative of the Robert Altman that made NASHVILLE, A WEDDING and SHORT CUTS. There is the same modern epic framework; large group of seemingly disparate characters surprisingly connected; the same mixture of farce and trauma, family rupture, failure, humiliation, death and loss. Except that Anderson seems to like his characters. The set-up, even in its fluctuations of time, is boldly schematic. Four parents in some ways betray their children - through sexual abuse, neglect, fraud, manipulation, or just from unrealistic pressures - causing untold psychic damage, leading to drug addiction, aggressive misogyny, mental imbalance verging on autism, petty theft.Stylistically, the film is Scorcese in insane fastforward (you don't even want to think about THAT one), beginning with dizzying explosivity, rarely letting up; the camera weaving hyperactivally through each story like a needle, rarely standing still; circling, nagging, swooping from up and down, full of bulging wide-angles and close-ups, punishing, driving onwards and onwards with berserk momentum as the characters wind down ever more gradually into paralysis; aided by a soundtrack that rarely shuts up, jerking from different moods, emotion, textures, volumes, as if trying to pummel the audience into submission. It is very exciting, if sometimes walking that tightrope looking down on exhaustion.Despite the inherent richness of each vignette; the varied, melodramatic emotions; the dense, complex dialogue; the comedy of impotence and anger, the tragedy of failure and dark secrets; the textural depth of each scene, the evocation of a space through lighting and details; the marshalling of an extraordinary cast (Tom Cruise is astonishing, as are Phillip Seymour Hoffman (of course) and Melora Walters), who can reveal so much about their lives through a wrinkle around the eye, a pained smile, a hurt, wounded look; in spite of the archetypal (verging on hackneyed?) situations - a dying father reunited with his errant son; the guilty golddigger who married a much older, now cancer-ridden, dying man; the kindly, inept cop whose alienated normality is veering so close to madness he holds lengthy ethical debates with a gun he soon loses, reaching out to another lonely, damaged misfit; the long-suffering, alcoholic wife who discovers her husband's adultery and incest just as he's about to die (has she always known? Does she collude through silence?), despite the profusion of cancer, betrayal, drug addiciton, humiliation, unreciprocated avowals; despite all these things, the film isn't moving.This is, of course, in no way a failure, because I think Anderson uses these well-worn situations, these familiar characters and the Altmanesque structure to fashion an almost anti-Altman film, or at least an optimistic riposte. Altman's involved linking of people through form ultimately reveals the impossibility of such linkings, how people are ultimately alienated from themselves, their families, their societies, their environment - his connections disconnect, leaving a frightening emptiness.Anderson's film is almost theological in its connectiveness. It begins the film like Greenaway's THE FALLS, a mock-documentary detailing the strange patternings beneath the seemingly random coincidences of our modern urban environment. Throughout this film, the catalogue of abuse on innocent people, the refusal to treat children as angels, is deeply, horribly shocking, although not as much as the disgusting inevitability.But, as his masterpiece BOOGIE NIGHTS showed, Anderson is at heart a benevolent moralist, and his ability to hone in on a city, to pick a group of seemingly disparate people - socially, intellectually, generationally etc - and untie them through their common humanity, abusers and abused, gives his film a godlike power that the director takes literally.In an old fashioned melodrama, whereever a mediocre dramatist had got himself into a narrative impasse he couldn't get out of, he would stick in an impossible contrivance to get the plot to its 'proper' conclusion, a deus ex machina. Anderson takes this 'deus' part literally, and sends down a parodic Old Testament plague on this emotionally corrupt Sodom and Gomorrhah, a rain of frogs. Subtly throughout, Anderson has been undermining his film's realism, through irony; through the implausible schematism; the 50s stylisation of late 90s L.A.; the unlikely accumulation of incidents in 24 hours; the intertitled use of weather as exagerrated pathetic fallacy; the various references to, and metaphors for filmmaking; Claudia's gorgeous wink to the camera; through effects such as the beautiful musical daisy chain where all the characters, no matter how separated by space, sing to a song played on one person's stereo, haunting, moving, but ultimately comic.And the nerve centre of crises that seem to suddenly, irrevocably accumulate are rent asunder by this absurd deluge, one of the most daring, bewildering, hilarious set-pieces I've seen in years. That this is a deus ex machina, and not a freak, is suggested by the moral division of spoils at the end, where hope and reconciliation are asserted by those, as Claudia asked, can be honest, while the one evasive liar, Jimmy Gator, lies forgotten, damned.Is this ultimately a film about filmmaking? The movie-saturated Anderson has expressed his eventual betrayal by a medium that teaches us so much, but evades so much more. MAGNOLIA is a modernist film about post-modernism, about how we, as humans, still feel intensely - as the characters do in this film - but have run out of modes with which to express these emotions, so we recycle the same old plots, tropes, characters, because everything we feel, no matter how real, seems like a cliche. Eco said something like this a few years back.This is presumably why the one thing that connects all four strands without directorial interference, is the TV programme, 'What Do Kids Know?', which offers one reality on screen, and hides another, life. What DO kids know? While everyone else is jolted by the frog explosion, Stanley turns it into a gorgeous, dreamlike epiphany. American history is nothing more than a jackboot stomped on this innocence forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the film masterpiece Magnolia, which to me is one of the greatest films of our generation, gave me almost a revelation after I had seen it. I had gone with my friend on the first day of spring break, and was expecting a good movie, one that would entertain us for the three hours-plus length that it is, but it gave me a new way to look at things. When we came out of the theater, I looked up just to see if there were any of what the final act entails, coming down on us. I knew that they were not going to be there but still, I looked all because of a movie. Not many films can do that to me. I sort of think of myself as one who is schooled in the art of film, I know that I know a lot, but this film was not like what I had seen before. Sure, it had things that happen in other films, like the estranged son coming to his father's deathbed, and the child genius and the loser, but this just put all of these people in a film that treated them like heroes, even if they had not something heroic, or maybe something far from. Paul Thomas Anderson has to be one of the most talented writer/director of this time. I had seen Boogie Nights before I saw Hard Eight, or Sydney, where it is sometimes billed as, and it was highly original and very funny. The acting in it was just great and it was a film that loved its actors. If you see, almost every shot of that film has a closeup of someone. Anyway, this film hinted the originality that was Paul Anderson. When I saw Hard Eight, I thought that this was a film that should of gotten more recognition than it deserved. This showed that P. T. Anderson knew what he was doing and that he could do it again easily. With Magnolia, I am almost at a loss of words, I have talked about his other films because I almost can't put what I want to say about Magnolia into my mouth. All I know is that it should of been the contendor for the best picture category for the oscars. So, if you can, watch Hard Eight and Boogie Nights before you see this. That way you can see the level of maturity and originality that P. T. Anderson puts into his films. I can't wait for is next one.</fullReview>

It had a real heart too.But was Magnolia made by the same director? I can hardly believe it. Anderson blew it completely on this movie. Nothing actually works...Main flaw is the poorly written script and the dialogues. He wants us to believe in all of his characters but he wrote TERRIBLE lines for them...And the actors look as if they know that. Reviews rave about the acting but only four stand out: Reilly, P.B. Hall, Hofman and yes...Cruise. Julianne Moore is only looking sad and misserable and her acting is very bad (her role is poorly written, okay....). Macey as Donnie the quizkid is boring and Macey plays again the part he plays in every movie...a waste.The stories that intertwine are cliche-ridden and amateurish: * Cruise as female bashing guru and his motivations are mildly funny, but predictable. * Robards as a dying man who delivers a monologue of 10 minutes in which he exactly explains what went wrong with him and his family. * Entire pointless scenes (Moore at the drugstore???, Sing a long of the entire cast??? The kid doing a terrible rap???) * The emotional childabuse by the quizkid's father is annoyingly predictable and so poorly written ("Be nicer to me, dad!") * The scene in the bar with Macey and the old guy makes no sense at all.No, the frograin doesn't help either, although it is highly original. He might have a (biblical) motivation for it, but that wouldn't even save this mess. They could have been little santa clauses or hamsters for that matter2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nine persons and what's happening to them during one day and one night in Los Angeles; all persons and stories in a way being connected to each other; a film running three hours and nine minutes: Regarding these facts, P.T. Anderson's movie strongly resembles "Short Cuts". But Magnolia is different: It is more irritating, more touching and somehow more fascinating than Robert Altman's work. It begins with the prologue, three short, bizarre and brilliantly presented episodes which are supposed to show that nothing in life happens accidentally - neither the death of a diver on top of a tree nor the murder that should have been a suicide. Nor what happens to the nine persons in L.A. The following episodes, in one way or the other, deal with the search for love and recognition. I won't give a summary of all things occuring - things often both tragic and humorous - because that would take too long. But the episode I liked most was the "kind of a" love story between the lonely (and also a bit clumsy) policeman Jim (John C. Reilly) and the drug- addicted Claudia Wilson Gator (Melora Walters). In the end it's raining - not cats and dogs, but frogs. A strange idea indeed, but I liked this surrealistic component (as well as the way Jim gets back his lost gun?). Finally, there is more than one question remaining unanswered which might disappoint some viewers. All in all, Magnolia is not that masterpiece some critics claim it to be. However, it is one of the few movies that require a further watching to discover all its facettes and to better recapitulate it - so that one might see the film in a different light. Until then: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different doesn't always mean good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poster says "P. T. Anderson presents Magnolia". The way writer/director/producer Paul Thomas Anderson uses his initials puts me in mind of P. T. Barnum, who said "There's a sucker born every minute." And when I walked out of the theater, I felt like a sucker, having spent seven dollars and three hours on this movie.This movie wants to do for drama what "Pulp Fiction" did for action-comedy. Like the aforementioned film, this film is a cluster somewhat interlinked stories set in L.A. But in "Pulp Fiction," the characters actually do things and wind up changed by their experiences. In "Magnolia," they just scream and curse and whine about how their parents ruined their lives or how they're really bad people. The opening narration states that this is a film about coincidences. My guess is that Anderson came up with a few scenes he wanted to put into a movie, but couldn't figure out how to make them into a cohesive whole. (Woody Allen had the same problem with "Deconstructing Harry," but came up with a better, funnier solution.)The best storyline (i.e. the only one I really liked) featured Jason Robards as a dying TV producer, the always-great Julianne Moore as his sexy young wife, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his nurse, and a never-hammier Tom Cruise as his prodigal son. I almost cried during those scenes, despite Cruise's bad acting.The worst storyline is about a boy genius on a game show who isn't allowed to use the bathroom during a taping of the show. Instead of mining the material for comedy, Anderson paints this situation just as tragically as the scenes I mentioned in the previous paragraph. At one point the boy makes an impassioned speech chastising the show's host and audience for making him feel like a freak. When I was that age, that was like asking your peers to beat you up.The movie isn't a total fiasco. Aside from Cruise, the film is well-acted throughout. The dialogue is also very well written. But the film is twice as long as it needs to be.This is the sort of movie that critics tend to overrate (like many foreign films) simply because it doesn't follow the conventional Hollywood formula. It is different. But different doesn't always mean good. I rated it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant totaly original movie, that I can only describe as a collection of stories of fascinating tragic characters who somehow their lives are all interconected in some way.Awesome performance by Cruise who plays the perceived definition of strong masculinity and then disintegrates on screen into the fraility that he really is. The other actors/actress are also brilliant accompanied by moody background music.Starts off a little slow but once you get past the first 20 minutes you are locked in for the ride till the end.Rating 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Mr Ripley and American Beauty were over hyped but this film wins the award by miles (well one hour anyway). The suggestion that this is a great film has little basis. At one hour less than the 185 minutes it runs (strolls) for, it might be considered a good movie.This film is a cracking example of being less than the sum of its parts, the performances are generally excellent particularly Philip Seymour Hoffman as a wonderfully sympathetic character, the music is haunting and thoroughly appropriate and the claustrophobic camera work is reminiscent of European film making at its best. Tom Cruise as a sex supremicist however is paper thin and totally unconvincing.Who cares about these people? They are not sympathetic or interesting characters and with the benefit of a week's hindsight very forgettable.Lacking the grubby edginess of Boogie Nights and the cleverness of Short Cuts, this film is to be avoided unless you have a steel bottom. Don't encourage directors to bring out flatulent films like this by giving them entrance money. Only David Lean manages to make three hours seem like one and this is no Lawrence Of Arabia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film can never be too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, "Magnolia" is a long film. Clocking in at three hours, it seems like I spent the entire day watching it. However, it was most certainly worth it. I'm glad every single minute was there. It's only when a film is terrible is it not worth its length. "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" was just over an hour and a half, but I would have given anything for it to be two reels shorter. "Dirty Work" with Norm MacDonald was 81 minutes and it felt like it took years off my life.The point being this: a long running time does not equal a bad film. Don't avoid this movie because it's supposedly too long because you'll miss out on one of the best films of 1999. Stop your whining about how it's too long, suck it in and see "Magnolia."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've seen this year....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful, rambling story set in the Los Angeles area. Many will see parallels with Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", as both are large long movies with characters that shuffle in and out of each other's life. This should not be seen as a criticism of "Magnolia", I think it's as good as Altman's work and there's clearly a rich vein that can be worked here.There's not much point in trying to explain the plot, simply because there's so much going on, just when you think you have some part of the story figured out it turns in a completely unexpected fashion. There are great performances by John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Jason Robards......look there're all great. The soundtrack by Aimee Mann provides a perfect Greek chorus to the story. My one quibble is that Paul Anderson has put in a couple of Supertramp numbers for no reason at all (except that maybe he likes them), but hey nobody's perfect.Do yourself a favour and go and see this, but make sure you don't drink too much soda pop at the start since this goes on for three hours....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>P.T. Anderson does Robert Altman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had Robert Altman decide to direct a movie similar to his classic films of NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS in 1999, he would have made a movie very similar to MAGNOLIA. But instead of Robert Altman, we get the Altman of the next generation, P.T. Anderson. Anderson is the same brilliant director behind the 1997 classic BOOGIE NIGHTS. And unlike other directors who decide to do a major big follow up to their previous hit, Anderson does a smart job with doing a intelligent follow up instead of a big budgeted follow up. MAGNOLIA is in the style of a Robert Altman film, it's a story that tells about different people's lives in the San Fernando Valley. Before you say, "SHORT CUTS rip-off" it's not, instead it's a tale that is more told in a biblical sense. The stories in MAGNOLIA intertwine, first there is the story of a officer (John C. Reilly) who questions a woman (Melora Walters) who's a drug addict and becomes attracted to her. Then there is former wiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) who is having a rough life, he just got fired from his job, and someone that he's intrested in isn't towards him. There's game show host Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall)who's dying of cancer, and reveals to his long time wife (Melinda Dillion) his dark past. Then there is the network executive of the network that airs the game show, Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) who is bedridden and is on life support, his wife (Julianne Moore) feels guilty about about marrying him for his money and finally feels love towards him. Where there's Earl's caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who is searching for Earl's lost son. Earl's son is motovational talker Frank T.J. Plackey (Tom Cruise), who has no remorse or sympathy towards his ill father. What I just said above is the complex plot that MAGNOLIA is about. It is a movie that shows a lot of character study, but unlike AMERICAN BEAUTY, there is a much more complex plot and the end of the film ties everything together and makes sense. There are even "inside" jokes in the film or foreshadowing that Anderson does show, but most would usually oversee, but I did catch it and it made the film even better. MAGNOLIA is a film that does seem a bit like SHORT CUTS, with the stories of imperfect people in a imperfect environment. Also all of the stories to connect in some way or another. But in the beginning of the film, Anderson does show a little story that deals with strange interactions that happen in people's lives that can really happen. But what Anderson does is make the film in style. He takes the Altman formula and puts a new style into it. Anderson makes it into a a music video style, even at one point, having the cast members sing a song that's being played over the soundtrack. But in the end MAGNOLIA is a masterpiece in it's own way. Anderson does a great job with his own take on a film with multiple characters. Anderson even has two strong actors from Altman's NASHVILLE, Michael Murphy and Henry Gibson play small roles in this film. It is a unique film, and I would consider it a cinemanic classic. The acting is quite good, especially Tom Cruise in the role of the motovational speaker T.J. Mackey. And the way Anderson tells the story in the same style he told BOOGIE NIGHTS, does make this three hour plus film to go by quickly. This is a film for those who when watching a film see beyond what's on screen will highly enjoy this film. It's veryintelligent and visionary. But for those who want to see what is on screen and for it to make some sort of explaination, better see something else. Overall, this is quite a unique experience to see on the big screen, which makes it a masterpiece! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modernity, Altman and Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is good especially because it fits very well the sociological context in which it was conceived: California. The fragmentation of the story into a whirlpool of stories, at times breathtaking, reminded me of the patchwork-style a la Altman. It's great for all those who have an interest in post-modernity because of the fragmentation of the events and the endless research of a moral ending to existence reminds of the post-modern philosophical debate. I think it's enjoyable to everyone because the story is meant to never leave the viewer one second to think about what is going on. Besides, don't worry, if you get bored the final scene will re-generate you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One strange, depressing movie with a couple of good points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie held my interest. It was difficult to guess where it was going, and there were so many sad,tense moments along the way! The character development was incredibly fast and yet well done. When the many story lines started to come together it was satifying to finally "get" the connections. I was hoping for some comic relief somewhere about half way through but found myself laughing, as one does in real life, at truly pitiful occasions. The movie "felt" as though it were nearing the end long before it actually concluded. The frogs were overdone. It certainly could have been subtle and still gotten the point across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic overkill---this review contains spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How anyone could love this movie is beyond me! When I saw this movie, I went into the movie theater with the highest of expectations. I loved Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights and Hard Eight, so I naturally expected I would love this movie too. But instead, Magnolia was the biggest letdown I have experienced at the movies all year. I seriously felt angry when I left the theater.What really gets my goat is that everyone whose opinions about movies that I respect seems to have taken a shine to this horrendous movie. Oh, and then there are those people who say that anyone who didn't like Magnolia obviously didn't "get" it. Trust me, I "got" Magnolia....I just didn't like what I got.The movie was well-acted by the whole cast. I especially liked Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, and Tom Cruise. But all their talents were wasted here, because the movie was so poorly written. Paul Thomas Anderson was simply trying too hard to make the viewers give a damn about his characters. Also, some of the characters could have been eliminated completely. Did we really need William H. Macy's character? And not one but TWO fathers dying of cancer? Maybe Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) and Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) could have been made into a single character.The movie was much too long and drawn out for its own good, too. Don't get me wrong. I am not afraid of long movies, or movies with an ensemble cast, but Magnolia was done in by both its length and its numerous characters and storylines. Magnolia could have been a better movie if P.T. Anderson had spent more than five minutes in the editing room. As I was watching this movie, I kept hoping it would get better (not a good sign), but it only got worse. This movie just lacked cohesion, and the fact that it was three hours long didn't help.And what was the purpose of the music? The background music never stopped and it drowned out dialogue at times. i thought it worked in the very last shot of the movie....but not for the WHOLE THING! Instead of enhancing the drama, it took away from it.The sing-along scene was laughably bad. And I don't even want to go into the frog plague. Was that P.T. Anderson's attempt at being surreal? It sabotaged the movie, as far as I am concerned. Many people consider it original and audacious. I just consider it as the excess of all excesses this movie hurls at the audience. Paul Thomas Anderson has got some nerve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had some very inventive ideas, and I found it to be much more watchable than 'American Beauty', but there were also some things that annoyed me about it...The overall length of the film, and of individual scenes was... well... long. Cutting would have helped. These long scenes do have one beneficial effect - separating the good actors from the "okay" ones. The good actors make their scenes watchable even when the writing or direction starts to falter.Good for Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, William Macy, and a few others...There aren't many moments of bad acting, but with this many resources at his disposal, the director has NO excuse for any bad acting. And there are a few...That said, Tom Cruise's monologues were disturbing and funny and he should get a gold statue for that... I liked the 'singing scenes' and the frogs especially.I also liked how none of the characters commented on the frogs. It was almost like, with all the sinning going on, they were expected at any moment. That was a nice touch.I told this to a friend of mine, and he said that the writer/director simply forgot to write in any reactions for the characters. I know that that can't be true - if it were, that would mean that a major hollywood writer/director like Thomas is pretty much a fake. That couldn't be true could it ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Perfect, But Worth Seeing For Sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson is, if nothing else, an absolutely marvellous actor's director. He helped Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds to give incredible performances in "Boogie Nights," and now does the same in "Magnolia" with a stellar ensemble. Moreover, Anderson has unquestionably improved upon himself as a director.While I admired the performances in "Boogie Nights," I wasn't especially impressed with it - I felt it lost its way badly in the third act. Not so with "Magnolia." It held my full attention for the complete running time. The characters are so fascinating, and the actors playing them so good, that the full three hours just fly by. I've long maintained that Tom Cruise has been unfairly represented as a pretty-boy movie star without any real talent as an actor, and I feel that this movie proves that. I dare anyone to find an incomplete performance from any of the substantial cast.A word about the obviously controversial ending - I can't quite decide whether I think it's the greatest ending ever or the worst. But it has the benefit of being unexpected and original.Anyhow - I heartily reccomend "Magnolia" to anyone who's a fan of great actors playing great characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for lovers of abstract art, but others may find it to be too much of a bad thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia had the potential to be a very good movie, and in most ways it was. It opened with a fascinating feature of seemingly impossible coincidences, and as it progressed the viewer realizes that the many separate stories within the film itself come together in amazing ways. In this way it delivered spectacularly on its already defined premise, but to the average movie-goer, there may have been too much intense and confusing emotional turmoil within the rest of the film.Virtually every single character displayed a lengthy crying scene, and while the characters personalities were very well portrayed, three hours may prove to many people to be too long to watch so much negative emotion. Keep in mind that 67% of people surveyed (according to Edwards Cinemas here in Fresno) believe that the most important reason to go to the movies is "to laugh."The ending of the movie was in my opinion the best part. I won't describe what happened in case people who haven't seen it may be reading this, but keep in mind that it is well worth sitting through the other three hours of the film. I think the first half hour and the last half hour were absolutely the best parts of this film, but the two hours in between could have benefited very much from a little editing. As it stands, I give it six stars, but hey, maybe I was too tired to give it a fair chance, it was my fifth movie of the day after all...</fullReview>

My Prof's point of view was that he had made it mysterious only to confuse the critics, and in the context of the rest of James' work it was something of a small insignificant piece. (This regardless of the fact that it's probably still taught as exemplary of James to a lot of college freshmen.) Whether my Prof was right or wrong, I'll probably never know, cuz I couldn't make it through the novel he did assign us. Nevertheless, Magnolia reminded me of this lecture, cuz though it looked like a work of art, aspired to be a work of art, felt like it should and must be a great movie, nevertheless never delivered. After almost 3 hours of waiting for something profound, I left the theatre thinking, "wow, that was totally meaningless, and was actually sort of stupid."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia.I went into this movie with just about no clue on what it was about, and now that I've been through three hours of it (yes, the whole thing), I still have no clue on what it was about. Perhaps it was a serious take-off of Seinfeld in that it was about nothing. Perhaps it is an attempt to make an artsy film that has crossover appeal in its actors. Perhaps it is an attempt to make a statement without really saying anything.The entire thing was too long, for one. I actually NOTICED time, which is a personal sign for a not-so-good film. There are roughly nine plotlines to follow. That'd be fine if said plotlines had interest. I ended up not caring about any of the characters whatsoever, even though this movie is allegedly all about the characters.There are a few pluses, but just a few. My favorite number, 82, makes quite a few appearances at the outset. Tom Cruise's character has an entertaining testosterone-based persona. The young quiz show boy really called the adults on many things. It was great to hear Aimee Mann's music, even if some of its positioning was corny. And, of course, who would expect to see something other than rain or snow fall from the sky?But just a small bit of pluses in a three hour attempt at a magnificent movie do nothing for me. I firmly believe Magnolia would have been better if it had a point.1.5/5.0 stars.</fullReview>

These include the too-loud musical tracks (pretentious, I thought); the frogs; the lack of cohesiveness until the end.This was a well-acted film. I loved Tom Cruise's performance. Most of the other actors were very good as well.The songs were good, and I especially liked the parts when music was used to somehow draw the characters together.The film did not hang together very well on first viewing, until the very end. Suddenly it was apparent what the theme was. Before that I had been thinking that it might just be the sort of film that never makes a point. That is fine in itself, but since it did finally make a point it would have made the viewing more enjoyable to give a few more clues about what the theme was DURING the film rather than just at the end. The film would probably improve with a second viewing, but I'm not planning on spending the money to find out.Still, it was worth seeing once and I found it engrossing throughout the entire three hours. I still don't know the relevance of the film's title, but perhaps that doesn't really matter. My opinion of this film is truly mixed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too depressing for some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I gave P.T. Anderson's Magnolia a moderately low rating (6) was because it depressed the me. My friend, who saw the movie with me, said, "You get out of it whatever you bring into it." He makes a good point there, so be warned that this is not uplifting material.Artistically, Magnolia was quite imaginative and well-done, especially the bizarre scene with all the frogs (I'm still not exactly sure what that was supposed to symbolize). Thankfully it was not as disturbing as Anderson's last feature, the highly acclaimed Boogie Nights. Many of the same cast members return (Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy) but their roles and situations are quite different, so it's not like watching the same film all over again. Several loosely related story lines are interwoven throughout, but it is edited well so scene changes are not choppy or abrupt. Aimee Mann's beautiful songs also help hold the film together (I especially like "Save Me"). For the most part I just wanted to throttle some of the characters for being such horrible people.I can't exactly recommend this movie, but I also can't say it's not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too depressing for some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I gave P.T. Anderson's Magnolia a moderately low rating (6) was because it depressed the me. My friend, who saw the movie with me, said, "You get out of it whatever you bring into it." He makes a good point there, so be warned that this is not uplifting material.Artistically, Magnolia was quite imaginative and well-done, especially the bizarre scene with all the frogs (I'm still not exactly sure what that was supposed to symbolize). Thankfully it was not as disturbing as Anderson's last feature, the highly acclaimed Boogie Nights. Many of the same cast members return (Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy) but their roles and situations are quite different, so it's not like watching the same film all over again. Several loosely related story lines are interwoven throughout, but it is edited well so scene changes are not choppy or abrupt. Aimee Mann's beautiful songs also help hold the film together (I especially like "Save Me"). For the most part I just wanted to throttle some of the characters for being such horrible people.I can't exactly recommend this movie, but I also can't say it's not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crushing disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough already. Everyone who's been raving about this movie needs to gain a little perspective. They seem to be confusing ambition with artistic success, and the film is nothing if not ambitious. After "Boogie Nights", I eagerly awaited PT Anderson's next film, and I can say without a doubt that this was one of the most crushing disappointments in my recent moviegoing memory. It's as if my boyhood crush had exposed some sides of his personality that were shallow, vulgar, and not as alluring as I had previously thought.First of all, let's get one thing out of the way: people who dislike this film (and I did like some of it), are not intellectually inferior to those who "get it". This type of condescension, not prayer, is truly the last refuge of a scoundrel. I (we) understand what he was trying to do, he simply did not succeed. He is not the first filmmaker to try his hand at magic realism, and he won't be the last (the superior "American Beauty" even tried this year with the same mixed results). In order for the raining frogs to work, there has to be more logic (even dreams have logic) than just sticking an Exodus 8.2 sign in an extras hand during the game show sequence and hope you are observant enough to pick it out. Who is this sign holder, and why is he there? This sort of glib pretension is really unfortunate.Secondly, let's talk about the confrontations between various characters. The worst scene in the otherwise excellent "Boogie Nights" is the confrontation between Dirk and his mother (ridiculously overplayed by Joanna Gleason in an underwritten part). Not a moment of it is believable, and "Magnolia" is full of underwritten scenes like this. And such shameless overacting! Tom Cruise deserves to lose the supporting actor nomination he's likely to receive for all that paraplegic "emoting" at Jason Robard's death bed. And while we're at it, why was Jason Robard's last speech so damn long? Mr. Anderson needs to learn how to edit his own writing, or find someone to stop him before he writes again. Julianne Moore, who was so great in "Cookie's Fortune", "An Ideal Husband", and "The End of the Affair" is left here to twist in the wind with lots of eye popping theatrics and lines like "I sucked other men's c*cks!" that even she can't put over. Lots of other good actors are wasted similarly. The Aimee Mann songs that accent the film are among my favorite parts of the movie (indeed, I've loved her music for so long that PT Anderson's affection for her, plus the inclusion of 2 Supertramp songs on the soundtrack, fooled me into thinking he may be my spiritual twin for a while).I suppose it's worth noting that at least the movie is responsible for some spirited debates, but the next time I walk into a Paul Thomas Anderson film, it will be with my guard up and a broken heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for the tolerant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I cannot recall ever seeing a movie like this. The movie has next to everything: irony, fore shadow, self vs self, and a peculiar causative incident that very much has nothing to do with the climax (or does it?). A police officer responds to a disturbance, a dying rich man wants to see and hear from his son again, a washed out child celebrity seeks to get braces only to find out he's finished from his job. The dying rich man's wife wants to take his pain yet has a chip of her own on her shoulder. The dying rich man's son is a sexist who practices, "Seduce and Destroy." A game show host is dying of cancer and has two months to live, while his daughter is really stashed full of drugs. A boy is being trained viciously by his father to dominate the game show the host is on.Lost yet? This is only the first fifteen minutes of a three hour film that throws plenty of curbs. Although sometimes the "point" of the movie is thrown off curb by a couple speeches (one extremely long one from the dying rich man), the relationship between each character and how everything is tied in adds some smiles and laughter sometimes, while making you sad and very sombre at other parts. Yet when the untimely climax occurs (which scared the very crud out of me when it began!), everything emotional seems to get thrown out of the window. Personally, it became downright hilarious. After a full two hours and forty five minutes of ups and downs with our characters, the strangest thing I have seen in a long time from Hollywood happened. No one should give it away, but throughout the movie, check the weather forecast when they are displayed at times.The movie can get very boring at times if you are squeamish. Some laughs will get you going, but the mood and atmosphere changes very fast with the conflicts between the characters and themselves inside. Unless you have a large screen TV, I would not recommend renting this as much as just mellowing out in the theater. The "large" effect made the effect of the climax all the more interesting. Heck the sound and its effects, was also impressive. The acting was excellent all around so there is no need for worry about that. In my books, this could hold Oscar awards, not for individual effort, but for overall achievement from everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for one movie to compare Magnolia to, you might be in trouble. Instead, imagine an amalgam of Pulp Fiction, Boogie Nights and Short Cuts. The 3:05 runtime might bother some people, but unlike some of the recent longer movies this is not simply the repetition of a good thing. Rather, it has so many stories to tell within one story. Magnolia is marked by at least a half-dozen tremendous performances, from the obvious ones (Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore) to the masterfully underplayed (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards). The latter serve to keep this monster from going on a rampage. This was really an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it good? Well, yes and no. It started out great, but then slipped into pointless meandering for hours and hours and hours...If the last two hours had been replaced with a decent 30-minute ending where all the characters come together in a surprising way, it would have been an *excellent* film. Breaking the movie into thirds (which felt about two hours each), I'd rate it 8-5-5, for a 6 overall.In a word: exasperating. But if you see a lot of films, and place a premium on originality, then the good points probably make it worth putting up with the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to laugh at the people who leave posts about how uncultured we Americans have become when it comes to films. It's like they think we can't be entertained. This movie did not make you think. Well, actually it did. It made me think, where on earth is this going, and please, let me jump into the screen and kill these annoying characters who I don't give a damned about, for good reason. Most of the people who liked the movie are the types who want to pretend to be "artsy," and just love the film, because it was so "visually stimulating," and it made you think so much....it made you look at life and have this urge to talk to others about our own lives and how this movie related to all of it. That annoys me so much. I go to a movie to be entertained. This movie was certainly far from entertaining, let me tell you that much. I could go on for days about how much I hate this movie, but I won't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nice attempt by P.T. Anderson at an Altmanesque, megacast, cavalcade of soul searchers, but sorry he just can't pull it off. This is only his third feature film and his first one, "Hard Eight" aka "Sydney", was simply awful. I guess when the studio gives you the opportunity to make such an ambitious project as "Magnolia" you have to go for it, cause you never know when you'll have another chance, but this was a film that could only have been pulled off by a writer/director with much more life experience than the 30 year old Anderson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films have received as much advance hype as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia. Ecstatic word of mouth and laudatory critical acclaim practically prepare the viewer for a life-altering experience when entering the theater. For what it's worth, Anderson gives it all guns just like he did in the wonderful Boogie Nights, and there is a lot of emotional resonance in what he is showing and saying. But the rapid fire cutting between story lines never allowed any of them to generate the resonance that was emerging, several passages of the film were ponderous, and worst, the film seems to carry no discernible message to its long and winding road other than that life is long, often disappointing, and sometimes really weird things happen. Thematically and structurally it bears great resemblance to Robert Altman's Short Cuts, although it would be a disservice to a talented director to accuse him of plagiarism. But it is not the great film that Short Cuts was, and is not up to the advance hype. It does have, however, many fine moments. Anderson likes to heap a lot on his plate, and Magnolia has five or six movie-of-the-week plots inside of it. But carrying off a challenge like that is a tall order and Anderson doesn't succeed. Most of the characters who are interacting at the edge of their plots are only peripherally involved with one another, and the real tie-off between them is a red herring - there just isn't one. Furthermore, certain characters are simply not going to cut as much mustard as others, and it is a distraction to have them consistently appear when nothing of value is added to the final product of the film. Performances are a saving grace - all of the characters are played by excellent actors which serves to keep the audience at least somewhat interested in what is going on with them. The movie shows us people who are experiencing the whole gamut of human experience; some are suffering through minor crises that seem major(to them) at the time. Others have old wounds that have scabbed over and are being picked afresh by new events. In the worst case, some are merely actuators for other characters, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse caring for a dying Jason Robards, the bulk of whose role is to make one long phone call to find Robard's estranged son at Robard's behest. Julianne Moore also has a cipher of a role playing Robard's guilt-ridden young wife who wants to renounce her coming inheritance because she now loves the dying man - all she does is cry, drink, and take pills in handfulls. Melora Walters plays a cocaine addict who attracts the attention of kind John C. Reilly, a cop. Her character also doesn't play out. William H. Macy plays a former quiz show whiz kid whose adult life is a mess and who has just lost his job. His primary conflict is losing his job at a Good Guys/Fry's when he wants to have corrective dental surgery he doesn't need. With the plethora of interesting characters and potential conflicts and actions, Anderson can't commit to any of them satisfactorily. This left me feeling half-full and somewhat disgruntled with the film as a whole.In at least one circumstance Anderson commits a fatal sin as a director, which is a monologue of what seems like several minutes of the dying Robards wherein he catalogues the great regret of his life. Movies aren't like books - you can skip passages in a book when it begins to drag, but a movie audience has to sit through every moment of a movie. I checked my watch TWO TIMES during this seeming interminable lull in the pace of the movie. If I check my watch once during a film it's not a very good sign. If I check it TWICE during the SAME SPEECH, AN EDITOR NEEDED TO DO SOME CUTTING. Robards is convincing, but he is a cantankerous actor and isn't given anything to do other than lie abed. I've mentioned the Robards plotline several times in this review and with reason - I think that the entire thing could have been cut out with the exception of Robards meeting his estranged son, the comedic and aggressive Tom Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey.I still recommend this film overall, however, primarily because if people are willing to subject themselves to something as stultifyingly mediocre as The Bone Collector, they ought to at least be willing to support a brush with genius. Anderson is a powerful and gifted writer-director. His virtuosity in composing and filming his shots is just as exciting and fresh here as it was in Boogie Nights, and less in your face. His ability to create believable and sympathetic characters is good. He just needs to learn economy and restraint. Magnolia is not a great film, but it gets exasperatingly close to greatness, which may be its most aggravating facet. Go see it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skeletons in the Closet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remarkable film from Boogie Nights' director Paul Thomas Anderson confirms more than ever that he's a filmmaker to keep an eye on. Though both films take place in the San Fernando Valley, focusing on character studies of troubled souls, each is very much independent of the other. Right from the start, it becomes obvious we're in for a heavy dose of how the past is a force to be reckoned with. As the musical score constantly fades in and out, changes and intensifies, so do the tangled webs of the characters...a dying man, a drug-addicted woman, a self-proclaimed leader of mean-spirited chauvinist seminars, a neurotic gay man who was once a quiz-show child prodigy, to name a few. The performances are top notch and the plot turns original and unexpected. The messages and frequently tortured experiences of the players join in a crescendo of turmoil that builds to a boiling point - a perfect example being actress Julianne Moore, who once again proves to be one of the best performers in contemporary film. As I did, you just might walk out of Magnolia thinking that your personal problems aren't really all that bad. In fact, I felt like Pollyanna compared to some of these people. And I didn't really feel manipulated, because the film felt real, even in spite of its surrealism. Deep down inside, I knew that there were probably a lot of people out there going through a lot of stuff just like the film's characters. Words really can't do Magnolia justice. It has to be seen and experienced. You wanna laugh? You wanna cry? You wanna gasp? Just see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and Complex Magnolia is an Ambitious Project, Just a Tad Bit Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us". An important line spoken in the very ambitious and heady film "Magnolia" that just tries a little too hard and test even the limits of the most patient moviegoers. P. T. Anderson, also known as Paul Thomas Anderson, the talented director of one of 1997's best films, "Boogie Nights" has done an amazing job of juggling this large talented cast and weaving them in and out of nine different, but somehow interconnected plotlines. That he is able to make sense out of all of this proves that "Boogie Nights" just was not a fluke. Mr. Anderson has the talent of a great director; he just overshoots too much on this powerful, intriguing, but way overlong film that loses some momentum in its three hours.In their search for happiness, many of the characters realize that hiding from the past just hinders the progression of a fulfilled life and that no matter what we think, life is a series of events that are all somehow connected with each other and effect all of us. The various plotlines include a lonely, good-hearted police officer, Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) who falls for a major cokehead, Claudia (Melora Walters), whose father is game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) who is dying of cancer. Then there is Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), the rich dying man, who has been estranged from his self-help guru son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), plus Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), former wunderkid, who is now one screwed up adult. These characters and others are searching for some happiness in their lives one way or another, but for some reason it eludes them.Anderson has put together a most amazing cast as he did with "Boogie Nights" and his first feature, "Hard Eight". He has not only assembled this great cast, but has also pulled some wonderful performances from all of them. Everyone is terrific and has their moments, but four individuals standout big time. Julianne Moore as the depressed wife of dying Earl Partridge gives another great performance (is she capable of a bad one, I don't think so). John C. Reilly, who has appeared in all three of Anderson's movies is excellent as the lovelorn cop, who just wants to do right in this world and meet someone to share his life. It is a focused and subtle performance that is so real. As the coke addicted Claudia, Melora Walters is magnificent as a bundle of nerves, insecurities and anger all combined. It is worthy of an Oscar nomination. Speaking of Oscar nomination, Tom Cruise as the macho self-help guru, gives his best performance since "Born on the Fourth of July". Cruise, who I usually find somewhat bland and limited in his range, is unbelievable here. What an amazing performance, maybe he should take more supporting roles, because he is terrific and shows not only great range, but also a pretty buff body that rivals his peer, Brad Pitt. For the first time Cruise, who I always find lacking sex appeal of any kind, actually sizzles on screen.Kudos to P.T. Anderson for managing to pull this picture off. Even though it is far from perfect, never the less there is no denying its powerful impact. Accolades also to Aimee Mann (former lead singer of the group "Till Tuesday") for a great soundtrack, what a voice. Recommended. × × × 1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant - but does not meet everyone's expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can see from the other reviews on this site, "Magnolia" is receiving a pretty 50/50 "loved it/hated it" reaction. I'm on the side of loving it. There are two main factors which contribute to folks' reaction, both negatively and positively. First, some are frustrated by the fact that the individual stories do not meet up in the end, that they aren't linked together in one huge scene where every character and situation comes together for a nice, tidy resolution. To that, I would point out that the stories ARE all linked together - thematically. Each of the pieces share common emotions and themes. They are all of a piece, though it may not be apparent to those who have had their senses dulled by the same old, tired Robert McKee story structure and must be spoon-fed themes and messages. Second, many view the big incident at the climax (which I will not give away, though many have already figured it out thanks to several loose-lipped reviewers) as a cheap stunt which takes the place of a disciplined, structured resolution. Again, this incident is completely in line with the theme Anderson has set up... it's surrealism (though based on an actual incident) is a treat, a masterstroke, a gift to those who don't mind being blindsided by something wholly original coming out of left field (I wish I could elaborate without spoiling it for those who haven't seen the film). Despite dealing with very emotionally-charged subjects, P. T. A. refuses to manipulate his audience. Unfortunately, many who are used to being manipulated by most Hollywood junk feel they are seeing something dull onscreen in the absence of clear, dramatic signposts ("okay, time for everyone in the audience to cry now!"). And, best of all, Anderson consistently casts incredible actors who seldom get their proper due (like "Close Encounter's" &amp; "A Christmas Story's" Melinda Dillon, "Laugh In!" &amp; "The Blues Brothers" Henry Gibson, Michael Bowen, and P. T. A. vet Melora Walters) and writes parts for them which allow them to go for broke. Some accuse Anderson of being "addicted to excess," but I feel his films are bold and brimming with life. I'll take this film over "Notting Hill" (ugh) any day. People who are complacent in their little "feel good flick" worlds where everything is spelled out in big, bold letters will be utterly lost. This film SHOULD be nominated for several Oscars, though it's difficult to say who gives the best performance as it is such an ensemble piece. Yes, Cruise has one of best roles to date, but he is by no means the top draw here. "Hard Eight" and "Boogie Knights" alumni John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, Walters, P. S. Hoffman, W. H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Alfred Molina, &amp; Ricky Jay all tear it up, as do Anderson newcomers Jeremy Blackman, Jason Robards, Gibson, Bowen, and Dillon. One of the best films of the year, a worthy successor to P. T. A.'s previous works, and a film which will incite debate and discussion long after you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminded me of "Short Cuts" without the talented writings of Raymond Carver and the creative genius of Robert Altman; the characters were those we encounter in our daily lives, and who wants to go to a film to see them even closer? I had the feeling that the writer/director P.T. Anderson was preaching to the audience - telling us that our behavior may reap punishment in the future - so what's new? The characters were mainly one dimensional, and Tom Cruise was flat. The only portrayal worth noting, for me, was the performer who played the female drug addict. I can't seem to locate her name on the play list - pardon me for that. But she was excellent. And why did "fuck" have to be used in every other sentence? Are we a nation of illiterates; must we reduce every adjective and verb to a sexual function? Surely Anderson must have had access to a Thesaurus - why not use creative language in sentences instead of taking us down to the level of being too hip to speak English properly. And the raining frogs was a nice touch, but perhaps the film should have started off with that so we would realize that there would be no redeeming characters in this film, not that there had to be any, but as I said - we see these people every day so who wants to pay to see them up close and personal? Not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had so many emotions coming out of this film. Let me first say that I really did want to like Magnolia. There is nothing that thrills me more than a film that takes risks and knocks that casual movie viewer out of their box. With Boogie Nights Paul Thomas Anderson showed us his brilliant and eye catching ability to direct a true feature film. It was also a great example of how a soundtrack can truly drive a film and add extreme life. All what I have mentioned of Boogie Nights and rave reviews lead me to undoubtly believe that Anderson pulled it off again. It pains me to say I was disappointed. If you get a chance watch the DVD version of Boogie Nights with the part where Anderson goes over nine deleted scenes and why they were cut out. Do you notice something. It seems to me Mr. Anderson forgot how to skillfully edit a film to give it the effect that's needed. There are too many scenes in Magnolia that go on way too long. The scene where Robards is mumbling on and on, the scene where Melora Walters is screaming at her dad (too many expletives killed this scene), and the scene where Reily and Walters are having coffee. These are all examples of scenes I don't understand why they weren't edited to make them more effectual. And if you're going to say that they were longer to fully show the emotion these people were feeling stop yourself right there. Showing emotion is great but if you sit there and and keep repeating it to hammer it in to your audience eventually you're going to knock them right out of the film. The audience and myself included already understood what was happening and were ready to move on, something Anderson mentioned quite frequently about why he cut out scenes in Boogie Nights, but Anderson sat there in a scene like we were children. ALL RIGHT WE KNOW JULIANNE IS UPSET CAN WE PLEASE MOVE ON!!! And, their is an overuse of expletives in this movie. I don't mind someone swearing like a sailor just as so it adds power and strength to a scene. Here it got annoying and becomes OVER THE TOP. What happened, what happened? I keep asking myself. As for the climatic ending, which every one has heard about, why didn't any of the characters in the film talk about it. Is it a cute little reference back to the opening sequence? Is that it? I'm supposed to believe that it just happened and that's it you just go on with your life? Come on give me a break. I wasn't looking for Boogie Nights part two. I was looking forward to that same directing style and the shot grabbing ability that thrilled me and made my eyes twinkle with delight. I was also looking forward to a story that would flow with the same drug inducing vigor that makes you unconsciously smile. If you want you can cast me off as someone who just didn't get it. Fine, it's an easy way to dispel someone. But I know the magic I saw in Boogie Nights and it took off and went on vacation in Magnolia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts out with an explicit premise: that there are some things too extraordinarily coincidental to be coincidence. But then never follows up on that premise. There are many wonderful things to be said about it. The pacing is fantastic. There is a palatable crescendo that builds the tension in your whole body. The pacing of the cuts is relentless. By the time the 2/3 point comes you are ready for an amazing collision of the well-crafted multiple plotlines. And it never comes. All I can think is that Paul Thomas Anderson couldn't figure out an ending. This film is like a Phil Collins song or an SNL bit. It's absolutely amazing and then nothing comes of it. I keep thinking of Hearts of Darkness. Coppola didn't have an ending for Apocalypse Now, so he just kept filming, hoping one would come to him. While the individual plotlines are all addressed, there is no bang. No congress between them. No coincidence. The intro is a lie. And the biblical plague of frogs finds no place in the plot. How could such an amazing start go so wrong? Performances by a huge number of actors from Boogie Nights are individually fantastic. Each of them threw themselves into their roles. As usual Julianne Moore is captivating. Worth seeing just for the 1st 2 hours of fantastic filmmaking. Just don't expect a payoff at the end. There are some nice comments about the fragility and sanctity of childhood as well.</fullReview>

I just think the film didn't have enough to say to fill its 190 minute length, the same message is kind of hammered into you the entire time. However, I will say the acting was good and was not what bothered me. The writing and editing was what fell short, much of this movie could have been trimmed down and maybe even a few of the characters removed completely. *SPOILER* Also, I am all for surrealism (it worked wonders in Being John Malkovich), but the "frog scene" felt really out of place in this film. Sorry, it did. *END SPOILER* For a better experience, go with the real deal and rent a Robert Altman film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the viewer's comments are almost as long as the film, so I'll make this brief! I don't know whether or not this is brilliant film-making or a scatalogical mess....it will likely take me a year to decide for myself. But before you decide to see Magnolia, please review both Roger Ebert's &amp; James Berardinelli's reviews to see if this is a worthwhile three hour investment for your viewing pleasures. These two esteemed critics see the film in a vastly different light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**WARNING!! SPOILERS AHEAD!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE!!**This movie had great actors, great performances, a great soundtrack, great cinematography, great camera direction, great DIRECTION overall, a great story, but it still SUCKED GOAT BUTT!! Why? because the end made no sense at all, and even on the level that it's supposed to make sense (coincidences happen, etc., etc., blah blah blah) it still doesn't gel with the rest of the film! I mean, at the beginning you've got some crazy, funny scenes about coincidence that are entirely PLAUSIBLE IN THE REAL WORLD, then you get into a really amazing, intricate set of stories for the next three hours that keeps you emotionally overwhelmed and in love with everything that's happening on screen. And then at the end frogs start falling from the sky!! PT ANDERSON, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?! what you missed is that the situations at the beginning are crazy but PLAUSIBLE, while the frogs make NO SENSE!! If you had just been clever and thought of some crazily intricate EARTH-BOUND schematics for everything to tie up in the end then the movie would have satisfied everyone AND you would have made your point that crazy things happen in the world and that's the way it is! But a biblical Armageddon reference of frogs falling from the sky? There's no advance notice for this, no buildup for it, no other biblical or fantasy elements in the picture to get the audience to thematically expect something so revelatory! Even the characters in the movie don't seem to make a big deal out of it! How can you expect us to then? MAGNOLIA is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen, not just because of the friggin' frogs, but because the friggin' frogs were the ONLY PROBLEM in the whole movie, but they still ruined everything else! You can't get much more depressed about film making than when you see so much acting, so much story, so much pure TALENT poured into a picture, and then one little smattering of ego in the wrong place causes the whole enterprise to fall flat on its face. In a place full of as much ego as Hollywood, this is a definitely not a good sign for the future. If one movie can completely screw me over after I got so emotionally wrapped up in it, how can I ever trust movies in general enough to get swept up in one again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson couldn't pull this one off. He was very lucky with his first 2 movies (Hard 8 and Boogie Nights) but this one really gets away from him. It's all over the place, unfocused and unappealing. The opening sequence baffled me--it was clear that he wanted to say that inexplicable things happen all the time, but what exactly did that have to do with the characters? I must've missed the point; call me dense. The characters for the most part were losers. The only character with any sympathetic traits was Stanley. My feeling is, Anderson admired Altman's "Short Cuts" (which is a great movie) so much that he wanted to create a homage. Right down to the "natural disaster" climax. My theory is, the footage at the beginning and the end was added so he wouldn't be labeled as a rip-off artist. What is frightening to me is that critics and audiences may embrace the film, allowing P.T. Anderson to make another puzzling, overlong and somewhat embarrassing movie. Yes, embarrassing. The cast singing along to that some made me CRINGE. Pointless. And not believable. I didn't hate the movie, although it may sound that way. I can't seem to get it out of my mind; for better or worse, it must have challenged me. The acting was good, with the exceptions of Julianne Moore and Jason Robards (hate myself for saying that!) Their characters are so shallow and vulgar that I guess they couldn't really do much with them. As for Tom Cruise, he fares slightly better than he did in Eyes Wide Shut, especially at the beginning. Who else could give self-help speeches like that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am ashamed to say that I've only establish to see this movie so late, after 14 yrs after its release, but I am so very happy that I did! Usually, I do not write movie reviews because I guess all the good or bad things that could have been said, were said. Still, this one left such a strong impression on me that I felt like a had to write something down.This movie is 100% art! It is a realistic portrait of our lives, lives that are filled with bitterness, sorrow, deceit and lies. It is a truly remarkable series of destinies that are followed through a 24 hrs period, not getting too much into detail, but long enough to give you a correct and pertinent information to help you see why the people we see today are the way they are. And there is no place for flower power kinda people to this movie, no place for the dreaming romantic kinda people, one should be open to receive reality just the way it is! Because, like the movie starts and ends, THIS MOVIE IS HAPPENING, THIS IS FOR A FACT WHAT HAPPENED, so do not wait for any warm hugs or any other gentle excuse for the harsh facts and feelings that you will examine here. There'll be none of that!But there'll be plenty of life, just as we live it! with lies, betrayals, hopes and dreams unfulfilled and broken trust. Still, at the end, this movie makes you see that forgiveness exists and that everyone has a good part in themselves. So you'll not have a bitter bad taste after, but you will not end up believing everything around you is pure and people are good. You'll see why some people are good, why some people are not so good today, after they had been damaged by some other people and you'll rethink your own existence. Because this is exactly the greatest goal of "Magnolia": it makes you evaluate and rethink your life, it makes you go deeper into your conscience.The cast is amazing, Seymour Hoffman is outstanding in his performance, being so normal and so "believable" to the audience. Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise are beyond greatness and I guess this might be the best cast EVER, in my humble opinion.Recommend this movie with all my heart, I gave it 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

A 2 1/2 hour film is usually too long for me and signifies a bad movie, much less a 3 hour one. I gave this one a shot because of the positive reviews and somewhat appealing opening. WASTE OF TIME. Nothing is revealed in the end that any human should not already know. Sometimes in life we are sad! sometimes we are happy! and then frogs fall from the sky??!! A bad attempt to pull together meaningless stories that everyone on the face of the planet already lives.

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After completing this movie, Paul Thomas Anderson gave a pretty daring statement saying that whatever movie he'd be directing in his later career, nothing could surpass 'Magnolia', which he, at the tender age of 29, called 'the best movie' he would ever make. Now, I'm not as daring as him and I won't say Magnolia WILL end up as the best film I ever watched, but so far, I haven't come across a better movie.'Magnolia' is really my favorite movie by some distance. It's biggest strength is how good it dissects its character. This is especially remarkable when you know there are like 10 main characters. Of course some characters are given a bit less screen time, but as a whole, every character gets his fair share of time and we have enough opportunities to get to know everyone and see what it's like to walk in their shoes. This is why the run time of three hours is entirely justified - not a second of it seems wasted.There is not much to say about the plot, especially since I don't want to spoiler anyone. It's just a bunch of more or less ordinary people, all carrying their very own emotional baggage, being followed around for one extraordinary day of their lives, all having to make decisions, all experiencing various emotions. You definitely need to like these kinds of movies, which is why Magnolia is so polarizing. I for one absolutely love character studies and I especially love it when it isn't about soldiers, superheroes, astronauts, killing machines or rock stars, but about people who just struggle to lead a happy life, people without superpowers, but with 'ordinary' problems like me and you. I also don't mind it getting a bit emotional. I basically knew I'd love 'Magnolia' just after reading the one-sentence plot summary here on IMDb, but I never knew how much I would be impressed with it.Needless to say, I love the cast of 'Magnolia'. Tom Cruise gives what I'd call the best performance of his career, Philip Seymour Hofman, although not exactly in a leading role, is always a treat, so is Julianne Moore, and some PTA-regulars like William H. Macy, Luis Guzmán, Philip Baker Hall and the awesome John C. Reilly are present as well.I was also blown away by the style of the movie, which just switches between the characters. While this may not be a particularly new concept, I see it as a very powerful device in 'Magnolia', partly because there are so many people to focus on, partly because of its long run time.So, to conclude this overly enthusiastic review, yeah, I dig 'Magnolia' like crazy. If you haven't watch it, just go and see it. There is the potential that you might hate it, but if you do like it, boy, then you'll be crazy about it. Paul Thomas Anderson is hands down my favorite director and Magnolia is hands down my favorite film, not only in his filmography, but also of all movies I have yet seen. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

This film is very exciting, it keeps you on edge, you fall in love with it, you cry with it, you laugh with it, and that is frankly how movies are supposed to do. You're supposed to connect with the film and be apart of it, and that is just something that PTA does best. Give or take, the frogs seemed to differ away from the story, but hey, it was entertaining.

		<fullReview>Magnolia is another impressive piece of work from director Paul Thomas Anderson, who once again manages to extract the best from the actors involved. There isn't really a standout performance, because each one of them has a moment to shine and show different layers to their characters. Speaking of which, they are all interrelated somehow and I was very invested in their stories. Not single one of them is disposable since you realize how their path illustrates several aspects of the human condition. That great effort put into developing each character's story arc is what I admire the most about the film. Magnolia can be quite humorous at times and also emotionally involving, having several powerful and memorable scenes that are still object of discussion in the present day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen many films quite like this. Its a layered film with multiple stories that play out simultaneously. The film explores addiction, family relations, abandonment etc. Its a fine tale of relations (often broken ones) between humans. While it is a really long film (over 3 hours running length) it is quite captivating. And its accompanied with a fantastic score that keep you glued to the film. There are certain flaws in the film, and some parts may be over-dramatic, but as a whole it is a strong work. There are fine performances throughout the film, especially one from Tom Cruise. He has some very memorable quotes in the film. I wasn't too big on how the film ended, but hey can't complain too much.Film lovers really need to watch this film.

		<fullReview>My friend Jim and his wife politely asked me to leave at the 120 mark. I comforted them with the usual stuff, 'it's almost over', 'it might get better' etc.Magnolia is chock full of fantastic actors giving it their Sundays' best. Tom Cruise in particular gives the best performance of his career. It's another quirky, outlandish role similar to his role in Tropic Thunder. The only parts of this movie that I found entertaining were the moments when Tom was on screen.This is tough. I realize that there was care and talent put into this film, but there comes a point were a film tries to be bigger than it is, and a point when boring becomes a negative that you just can't overcome as a viewer. This film makes 'Out of Africa', and 'The Thin Red Line' look action packed.I understand the members wanting to 'conform' to the high user rating here as to look more film-savvy or film-educated, but this movie is like pulling healthy teeth with plastic scissors.I appreciate it for what it is - something that I will never, EVER watch again.It's not that I 'didn't get', or the assumption that I can't enjoy a slow film(because I can), but I found the pace to be record-setting slow, and with a biblical, philosophical surprise that does nothing for me except ruin the realism and the performances that led to it. To squash any attempts to say that I cannot appreciate a film like this - I loved 'There Will Be Blood' - another 'slower-paced' film from the same director no less.Not recommended.48/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a film that asks more questions then it answers. From the over the top characters to the rain of frogs magnolia is a test in how far great diologue and acting can take you. The script was beautifully written and the acting was excellent, but does that justify the journey that magnolia takes us on? In the beginning Magnolia sets its self up to be a movie about coincidence and fate,it seems to diverge from this theme though as the film goes on. Nothing in the narrative is outstandingly coincidental. The focus of the film becomes 7 people whos lives are miserable and the ways in which they try to remedy their misery. As the film progresses the connections between the 7characters are illustrated, but there is no profound meaning or lesson to these connections. As the film begins to come to a close the characters do have their own personal wake up calls and we get some closure on their stories.The last curve ball that P.T. Anderson throws the audience is the final acts culmination of a rain of frogs. To what conclusion this element was trying to bring, this viewer does not know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, according to the world, is wonderful. (It is extremely well done - acting, writing, and directing.) However, in reality, it is a veil to the truth. (I say this since it is teaching the opposite of what is true. I.e. it is not just entertainment.)God is Sovereign. His Son, Jesus Christ, delivered the message of good news - with faith in Him you have real hope of eternal peace. Without faith in Him ... well, as the Bible says: "Anyone who is among the living has hope..." (Ecc. 9:4). So while you are alive ("...among the living...") accept Christ into your heart so you too can share in the _real_hope_ that is in Jesus Christ.Christ taught that there are basically two laws in Luke 10:27 "He answered: ' "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind"; and, "Love your neighbor as yourself." ' " (also reported in Matthew 22:36-40, and Mark 12:29-31)This is impossible without you accepting Christ into your heart. God our Father, Who is in Heaven, Whose name is holy, promises to save all those who have faith in their heart. Without that faith you have only the hope that one day you too may believe.And so the world goes - swimming around like an ocean full of fish - each fighting and biting each other looking for another fish to eat. Some of us, whose eyes have been open, who have received the message of good news, who know of real hope, keep casting our nets in hopes of bringing on board, saving someone from the deep ocean, are "fishermen"."The LORD bless you and keep you;the LORD make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you;the LORD turn His face toward you and give you peace."- Numbers 6:24-26______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Amazement: Magnolia Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of the compelling P.T. Anderson picture, Magnolia.Magnolia tells numerous interrelated stories, which i believe, are all centered around the Television game show featured in the film called "What Do Kids Know?" All the branches of characters and their stories in the film come to a conclusion at the game show.Using enjoyable music, specific lighting, camera work and dialogue, P.T. Anderson has created a rather odd but all-around interesting look into alienated suburbia with such characters as a single cop, depressed game show host, dying game show owner, the caretaker, drug-addicted daughter, lonely mother, regretful wife, angry son, the former Quiz-Kid and the intelligent game show boy.Once the film starts you get feel for the film and realize that this film is one of THOSE films: the specific taste which you either love or hate. ALL of P.T. Anderson's films have this feel and/or originality to them.Going into this film, I had expected an interesting &amp; enjoyable movie. I watched it not know what was going on 75% of the time but still feeling like I had a grip on the current events in the story, which is one of the most intriguing viewing experiences I have had in a long while. It, along with the film's original camera work, made this film extremely watchable, giving it an effect/print of it's own that it leaves on you after watching it.I'm not sure how to describe this film, I never have been able to. And after asking some of the people i know who have seen this, i've gotten comments that consist of such words like "fantastic", "odd", "stupid", "amazing", "interesting" &amp; "original". Most of the comments have averaged up into what i have to describe this film's experience:ODD AMAZEMENT.</fullReview>

I have scene this movie 14 times. This is not a boring movie. For those people who do give up during the movie, the ending is outstanding. It's a melodrama with strong emotions, punishments, connections, and coincidence and with some of the best actors. If you like the movie Crash, you will like this one.

		<fullReview>I don't often see a movie again soon after finishing the first viewing. Sometimes, like good liquor, you like to take it in more slowly, at another time.This film, however, was so professional, so well acted, so interesting that I had to see it again just a day later. So, to finish the metaphor, I was drunk with delight by the time the credits rolled around again.First, this is a very clever film, whereby director Anderson uses fourteen or so disparate people to act as a mosaic to form an apparently disjointed narrative encapsulating one central theme, or core principle, if you will: the need to care for each other. Sure, this narrative also covers concepts such as redemption, guilt and the like; and many films have explored that central theme but this is the first (I recall) that sets it all against one day in the life and death of a few Los Angeleans, most of whom have specific or tenuous links to each other. A later film that comes to mind ? Crash (2004) ? also explores the same idea of links across people, but that narrative has a more frenetic pace, a harder edge and is not as cohesive as Magnolia, in my opinion.Second, Anderson sets the viewer up to accept the idea that fantastic or odd coincidences do occur in life ? and thus in this story ? with three vignettes at the start, all apparently taken from real life, but all probably fictitious. Entertaining ? yes; necessary ? no. As a viewer, I didn't need that reinforcement because I've encountered many instances of almost unbelievable coincidences; and I'm sure that many contributors and readers here have experienced the same. So, the movie could have been twenty minutes shorter for me. But, I'm not really complaining...Third, the production standards (despite some of the listed goofs and continuity errors), cinematography/editing, and special effects are generally very good overall; there were a variety of cuts, long takes and matching on action shots that were simply exquisite, not to mention many of the medium and extreme close-ups. Without a doubt, this is a finely crafted movie. And here, I'll include the sound track: a mix of well-known songs from yesteryears (Supertramp and others), a few beautiful ballads from Aimee Mann, and overarching, powerful orchestral pieces.Finally, the ensemble cast which produced the best piece I've ever seen from Tom Cruise (an actor I don't have much time for) as Frank Mackey, in a wonderful parody of the TV cult of male machismo; Julianne Moore showing that she can do a foul-mouthed shrew as powerfully as, say, Bette Davis from long ago; William H. Macy as Donnie, a nervously depressed ex-wunderkind of the sixties who just wants to love somebody; Philip Baker Hall as the TV host with dark secrets; Melora Walters as his daughter, Claudia, lost in a lust to lose herself in self-abuse and drugs; Jason Robards as Earl, the dying lecher who just wants to see his son, Frank TJ Mackey; and Stanley, the new TV whiz kid who just wants to be a kid for his dad, not a money machine ? all of whom are linked and joined by the caring attention of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Phil, the male nurse for the dying Earl and big Jim Kurring, the keystone for this film and narrator in situ, played by a magnificent John C. Reilly.The action of the story begins with Jim and ends with Jim, delivering a voice over about how he sees the world and his job as a cop, how he must do good for others as an officer of the law, and how he must do as much as he can to care for others, even the worst, and even to the point of forgiving instead of punishing. Hence, Jim is as much as player in his world as he is a metaphor for how all of us should behave towards each other, in a caring, thoughtful and compassionate manner. All writers include something of themselves in their narratives. My guess is that much of what Jim says and does comes straight from director Anderson's own philosophy and experience; but I could be wrong.And the ending? There's been a lot said about that. If you don't know, don't worry about it ? these things happen all the time. Trust me...I've not seen Boogie Nights yet, Anderson's earlier work of note; so, I guess I'll have a look. Magnolia, however, is a great achievement from a relatively young man who will definitely go a long, long way in the history of cinema. I'll make a point of adding Anderson to my list of must-see directors, up there with Scorsese, Lynch, Malick and Eastwood.Truly, your life's cinematic experience will poorer if you do not see this movie.</fullReview>

Well, I wasn't disappointed at all and got even more than I expected. "Magnolia" is a fine piece of quality drama. The movie introduces us different characters which all are in search of love and happiness in their own specific ways. They all have their stories, deep and touching, which the viewer follows throughout the movie. A dying father, a young wife disappointed in her life, a passionate nurse, a male game-show host, a child genius long for his father's love, a daughter using drugs and a famous ladies' man - There's more, but I leave the rest of the analyzing to you."Magnolia" isn't a typical stories-bound-together -film. Despite the fact of it following the same theme as movies like these usually do it still manages to be original. The storytelling is absolutely brilliant, the whole building up of the characters follows the story in a fantastic flow and although the movie lasts for three hours it doesn't feel that long at all. The structure captures the attention of the viewer by first being depressive and sort of intense, but then it raises from a significant melancholy to a joyful experience and celebration, everything changes in a way that makes this film so unique and that is also surprisingly easy for your eyes and ears. The movie also includes one of the most surprising and twisted endings I've ever seen in a motion picture, you just can't see it coming unless you know it before-hand. The movie has this theme of unusual things happening throughout the human history and a message that these unusual, unimaginable, things are in fact occurring at this very moment and it happens all the time. Whether you believe it or not, it still happens and you can't change that. The film follows this theme along the progressions of the characters and their stories, and it is adapted to these stories in a terrific way.What also makes this movie so damn good is the role performances, or should I say the actors/actresses doing them. Almost every performance is excellent and it is a real pleasure for your eyes to see such marvellous actors/actresses working together. Tom Cruise, who is in fact one of my favourite actors of all time, makes a stunning performance as Frank T.J. Mackey, the famous ladies' man. Cruise was even nominated for an Academy Award from the role. It's a real shame that Cruise doesn't do drama so much, as he is to me an ideal actor in a depressing and emotional drama. One of the reasons why I even bought this film on DVD was that it was a drama with Cruise in it, and the reviews weren't bad either. Then there's the always brilliant William H. Macy as the old child genius Donnie Smith, who now a loser and a failure in his own life, regretting his past. Macy is once again perfect in his role and he's one of those actors who can pretty much depress the whole audience by just pulling off a melancholy face, it's just that intense.John C. Reilly as Jim Kurring, a cop seeking for love, also shows us that he can do impressive drama as well. Philip Baker Hall as the famous game-show host Jimmy Gator, Philip Seymour Hoffman as the emotional nurse Phil Parma, Jason Robards as the dying father Earl Partridge who now regrets the mistakes he has made in his life. Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge wasn't the best Moore I've seen. I think she wasn't so fit for the role itself and her performance was kind of a disappointment, though it isn't bad at all. I was just expecting more from her. Then there's the not so known actress Melora Walters as Claudia Wilson Gator, the daughter on drugs whose father seeks for her love. Walters also does an astonishing performance and when she is working together with Reilly the chemistry is overwhelming. Jeremy Blackman as Stanley Spector, the child genius long for his father's love, does one of the best performances I've seen from a child actor. The list just goes on and on and if you're seeking for a movie filled with excellent role performances then this is most certainly the movie you want to see.Paul Thomas Anderson as the director does an amazing job behind the camera. We haven't heard much about him, but hopefully will be hearing much more about him in the future. His directing reflects the whole theme of the film so well and the music the movie has grows up situations which are larger than life. Anderson was nominated for an Oscar from this movie, for the Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, so he was the man behind the pen and paper as well. The movie has this one particular scene which I thought was absolutely beautiful and probably one of the best scenes I've ever seen, or at least the best scene I've seen in a long time. In this particular scene, both directing and the music, are used in a superior way and it's just mind blowing. I won't spoil the scene by telling you what it is, but I all I can say is that the scene includes singing. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. Paul Thomas Anderson, I salute you. "Magnolia" is, all in all, a great film. It has everything a drama should have; Excellent role performances, superb directing, terrific music, amazing screenplay and storytelling, being also so emotional, deep and touching. It's powerful, it's beautiful and at its best moments it's a streaming river that goes by. For every drama fan it is definitely a movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my mind, movies (unlike music) are sort of unattainable. Titles, plots, characters...they tend to crossover and blur in my brain to the point where I sometimes forget having seen them at all - even excellent ones (whereas I rarely forget anything about a song.) But this is a real movie. Magnolia is unforgettable. The look, the atmosphere, the performances are all wonderful. Seriously crafted, the story moves from contemplative and existential to funny, sad, weird and more. The transitions are natural and the movie is at all times engrossing. Magnolia is a movie so good it almost defies description, it is felt as much as it is viewed.The cast is stellar. My personal favorites include the amusingly vulnerable cop (that's right) played by John C. Reilly, the dick-headed motivational speaker (right again) played by Tom Cruise, and Philip Seymour Hoffman never disappoints. The list of intelligent performances just goes on.I saw a behind-the-scenes special about the production of Magnolia. In it, Director Paul Thomas Anderson came across as hyper and a bit of a motormouth. Frankly it was tiring just watching him. But the end result...all is forgiven. There is a real vision there, there's no denying it.Yes, Magnolia is over 3 hours. I really don't know why some people have such a problem with that. Even the ADD-afflicted still have scene changes aplenty that should hold their interest. It is gripping and stirring, powerful and subtle.I still say that music is the most sophisticated art form. However, Magnolia makes a very strong case for movies. Speaking of music, even Aimee Mann shines in this movie. Absolutely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anderson's film seems to be modeled after Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," even enlisting Moore from that terrific movie but he should have enlisted Altman himself as he does not have the skills either as writer or director to pull this off. After the extended prologue about coincidences in life, one would expect the multiple plot lines to somehow come together but no...the prologue has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Among the actors, Hoffman and Reilly come off best while Cruise is downright awful in his emotional scene with Robards. The various plot threads are interesting but the success of a film like this hinges on how everything is tied together, but what we get is an incredibly stupid ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heh, now that I got your attention with my title, let me tell you what it means. This movie begins brilliantly. Like a thrilling sexual encounter, the opening scene hooks us. From there it builds up very nicely. A lot of intensity, passion, power, throbbing scenes and undulating rhythms. Ooh baby. Then right at the halfway mark--whoosh! An awesome climax.And for the next hour I'm sitting there saying, uh OK, why am I still here? The second half had none of the thrill. The music (which was wonderfully prominent for the first half) is nonexistent. Julianne Moore's performance (which was tantalizing for the first half) becomes histrionic and overplayed (how many times can she yell the f* word with tears flowing?). And, contrary to what the great introduction promised us, the plot does not come together in one marvellous unifying event. Rather, things just sort of drag on until time runs out.It's not a bad movie. But much like that aforementioned sexual encounter, it just peters out early. Maybe the director should have thrown in a scene about baseball, just to hold back a bit. Know what I mean, guys? Tee hee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ambitious" is the adjective used whenever I complain about this movie. While complexity and intricate storytelling are a plus where I'm concerned, this film overdoes it. Flawed characters make the best entertainment whether it be thought provoking or comedic but these well acted characters spend most of their screen time yelling at each other. Though well directed and with a strong cast, the movie's convoluted story has so many elements that it becomes unwieldy and its message so pretentiously esoteric it seems like the stereotypical work of a bad film student. Some bizarre or unclear creations are quite strong and enjoyable (think Donnie Darko, anything by Miranda July, and Twin Peaks), Magnolia is crippled by it and will likely numb you into thinking (though probably never admitting) "Wow, I don't know what just happened or why, but I bet it's deep." Had Magnolia been cut to a manageable length, necessitating the removal of several obsolete story lines, it might be comparable to American Beauty in its (relatively) realistic dialog and probing look into characters' daily lives. American Beauty is not without its share of detractors but until I saw some of my favorite movie in Magnolia I refused to associate with its critics. Chances are (unfortunately) that if you like AB, you'll like Magnolia. But if you want to save yourself some trouble, watch Fargo again instead because William H. Macy plays the same pathetic character-type.</fullReview>

Oddly, here is my coincidence - I also viewed another movie about coincidences for the first time this week. That was the wonderful "I Heart Huckabees" - certainly not dissimilar, except it was obviously a much more light-hearted and comedic approach to the topic.Well, I would say that my favorite movie of all time is "Mulholland Drive", but now having seen "Magnolia" I'm not so sure about that anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Review of a Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when much of what comes out in Hollywood is simply the regurgitation of old TV shows, thank God for Paul Thomas Anderson's gall in bringing us Magnolia, about that which is most important in life: self-awareness and our often startling and tragic lack of it.I didn't actually write the perfect review of this movie (I know you're shocked). The best review of this film I've seen (here on IMDb or elsewhere in fact) is by aerives, and I must recommend you read it. Much of what I have to say on the subject of Magnolia he said-- and better than I would have. In some ways I consider my comments something of an unauthorized addendum to his, though I am sure that a discussion of the revelations in Magnolia could go on ad infinitum.I think many of the people who take issue with this film do so because the use of the language, among other visually and emotionally jarring elements, offends their sensibilities in some way. On the IMDb's title page for Magnolia, for example, it blithely informs us under Trivia that the word "fuck" is used 190 times. However, within the context of the film the fact that everyone speaks "the same language" ties it all together in a way that nothing else does. The patterns, both archetypal and specific, throughout the film (The child is affected by the parent, the child becomes the parent and affects their child. The past affects the present which affects the future) -- all of the-- are looped into one another more fully because the "voice" that speaks the stories, even speaks through the separate characters, remains consistent.In any event Magnolia is, in my estimation, a perfect film. It has a vibrancy and an electricity that is unparalleled and a message that screams to make itself heard. It is not, however, for the faint of heart or those unprepared for its powerful and often alarming, "in your face" approach to the story it is telling. Nor is it, I think, for those leading unexamined lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to watch over and over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since Robert Altman's Nashville have I been so engrossed in a film. Although the characters have no relation to each other, and there are a number of different stories, they are seamlessly woven together as the action moves forward relentlessly toward the finale. The soundtrack is overlaid with atmospheric, frequently dark, classical music. Among the many outstanding performances are those of Tom Cruise (although not my favorite actor) as a shallow self-invented self-help guru focusing on, to put it delicately, putting women in their place. Although his character represents everything that is vain, shallow, egotistical and deceitful, he is also everything that is applauded in the get rich quick world of seminars and infomercials. the other stand out is William H. Macy as the former child whiz kid whose earning were squandered by his parents and is now an adult has been hanging out in gay bars looking for love.Definitely a film to watch with friends who enjoy a discussion afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are no big twists to make you turn but instead a development of understanding of the lives of these characters being focused on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To summarise, this movie is a deep portrayal of the lives of multiple characters. Somehow they get intertwined, but not made to appear so for the entertainment of a movie.There are no big twists to make you turn but instead a development of understanding of the lives of these characters being focused on. As the tag line suggests, things happen, and sometimes not for any particular reason but sometimes they do.Lots of other movies that i've seen where there appears to be a build up towards a grand climax, is done to give an ending twist- which then renders the movie viewable only once with the same eyes, if that makes sense. I don't think the sixth sense can be watched with the same eyes the second time.In Magnolia we see the development of stories which build toward a grand climax. Magnolia differs from others however as whilst some of the points of interest are predictable, the suspense is in how we see characters in the movie react to these moments not a revelation in storyline.The acting and direction is in a perfect blend with the setting and content. We feel the pain, the happiness and the relief of those on screen. Movies where you want to see the reaction of characters to revelation in storyline appear with great emotion and understanding, we never feel left out.I originally hired this film after hearing about Tom Cruise's roll as Frank Mackey who is basically the Neil Strauss of this film, a woman tamer and god amongst men who don't know how to play the game of getting to bed with women.Cruise plays a character in only one story of several that this movie tells. His acting and emotion in this film is well deserved of his golden globe award.Whilst this movie is quite deep in the way things intertwine, try not to think too hard about the background as you will miss the importance of the foreground. One hint, this movie isn't cut up in different time sections, it is a story of one particular period of time displayed from start to finish.I'll try not to spoil this for you, but I do want to say, this 3 hour feature film is definitely worth watching, keep a night free to watch it at your own lesuire. Don't ruin being moved by a brilliant film by watching it during conversation or before u go out on a night in the town.The climax of this movie will display and event that is very out of place and i believe was put in to make us just realise that some things happen, for no apparent reason- some need to be recognised throughly and some should just be left as a past event.There is something there for all of us to take away, and for me personally, it has made me realise that saying that you regret something is not a bad thing to say. I've always thought regret is a waste as you don't take decisions made and make something good out of them. But for some things, there is no good that comes out of it and i suppose we need to all acknowledge that these things happen. We can't do anything more about them now and it's OK to recognise what we have done wrong in the past regardless of our current situation. Nobody is perfect and to say we regret decisions made is OK, as long as we recognise bad decisions as bad things and not always as "it was for the best". It's not about dwelling about the past, but more about recognition of something that was wrong and giving it it's true recognition it deserves- especially if it has affected others you love.The big quote from this movie is "We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us"</fullReview>

I suppose people either love it or hate it , or just don't get it. Anyway I've been listening to the CD "Celebrities at their Worst" , and there's a cut in which Ernie Anderson , father of the films director ,PT Anderson, is swearing a blue streak. The Jason Robards character is probably based on Ernie Anderson , because if you heard the Ernie Anderson CD , you would swear you were watching a scene from Magnolia. In fact , Ernie Anderson should have had a writing credit, because Jason Riobard's dialog is lifted from that Ernie Anderson cut . It's very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much whining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is not a bad film. The wide range of societal criticism is thought provoking.But it has a couple of serious flaws.A) Though the main characters are believable and well-acted, the film failed to achieve what is was meant to in one respect: I couldn't identify with any of their problems.Here is why. As far as I'm concerned they all had one thing in common: They lived in an acute state of denial, in one way or another. This in turn lead to a great deal of anxiety and neurosis. All the way through the film I just wanted to give them a good slap in their face and tell them to get their act together. Even the motivational trainer guy, who was meant to do just that, was himself an emotional wreck laden with unresolved mental issues. And what kind of a policeman starts crying just because he loses a gun? How pathetic. Refreshingly, in the end the much needed slap did literally arrive in the form of amphibian precipitation.So this is good a film about a bunch of whiny neurotics from different walks of life who take themselves far too seriously and wallow in their problems. Fair enough. I have nothing against watching a film about neurotics, even if it gets a bit irritating after three hours. In fact, the nurse was the most irritating character I've ever seen on a movie screen. I still can't decide whether this is because of very good or very bad acting.But to say that this is a fair representation of society is wrong. I'm a person who tries to be honest with myself I'm not a natural worrier. When I'm faced with a problem I don't whine about it but I a) accept that I have a problem and b) do my best to solve it. It would be fair to say that most of the people I know are similar. Neurotics are in the minority in this world.Or is it perhaps just American society that lives in a state of collective denial, which is why this film went down so well with American viewers? Nah, that would be an easy prejudice to fall back on. Most of my American friends are perfectly normal people just like everybody else.B) The CONSTANT excessively dramatic music was distracting. It just made me nervous and added nothing to the film. Or was I meant to feel neurotic too? :-) The point where all the characters start singing the same song wasn't emotional, it was simply ridiculous.</fullReview>

When these two are combined with perfect timing of the different happenings in the movie, it just makes an awesome combination. One of my favorite scene is the interview of Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), when there seems to be a constant battle between Frank and the interviewer, where both are trying to get an upper hand in the interview.One thing that sets this movie apart from anything else I've seen are the fluent transitions from one character and situation to another. Long shots of one person and then camera start to follow somebody else when the characters come across in a corridor.The movie is also funny at times. For example, Jim Curring, loses his gun and it seems to be the worst thing that could happen to him, when everybody around him is very sick either mentally or physically. It just goes to show that events in one's life should be put into perspective.</fullReview>

It falls in the angst, shock-a-rama, "lets explore the dark underbelly of capitalism", surrealistic, shockingly provocative ... blah blah blah ... category, which was entirely expected.Life in the San Fernando valley forms the backdrop to many of Andersons films including this one. We tumble thru the vagaries of life without love, rewards without risk, fame without name and various other maladies in the lives of the myriad characters. Drug abuse, child molestation, father-son drama, wife-cheating... you name it and its there. Episodic rants aside, the story unfolds quite unlike the petals of a flower in bloom. The freak-show son seeking closure with his dying dad, a cop who falls for a junkie he rescues, TV host with a sordid past, intertwined with an ex-quiz show winner who's now a complete loser. These are not quite your everyday Joe, Emily and Harry in the hood.The critics of course, love such over-the-top cynical fare, especially if it shoves all five fat fingers right into your eyes. But its only mildly entertaining and somewhat boring, with the irritating background score *repeatedly* ringing into one's ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Other Movie Will Ever Compare to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Magnolia, my heart grew so tired from the constant strain that each scene put on it. Just when I thought- "oh, maybe there's some relief in the next scene" - it only got worse.Also, I was ANGRY about "the frog scene". But that's because I didn't understand it like I do now.Magnolia is where I fell in love with Phillip Seymore Hoffman.If there's a guy just like his character in real life- I'd marry him right now!!! There was a point in my life after college, where I watched Magnolia EVERY SINGLE NIGHT after work. It helped me understand what to do with my independence. It also helped me analyze EVERY scene.*The reason for the frogs is because any other natural disaster would have looked wimpy on the screen. We've all seen Twister- and Day After Tomorrow. Nothing would have had as much of an impact on us (the viewer) as it did on the characters. But it was SO important that we continue to feel what they feel.So the frogs made us go, "WHAT THE HECK!?!?!" "WHY????" and "THIS IS BULL!" "NO WAY THIS WOULD HAPPEN" (Plus it's also a biblical allusion, but I don't believe that's as important as the shock-factor.) This event (the frogs) set everything in motion- the way it was supposed to be. Divine Intervention.There's so much to say about this movie, but if you haven't had the pleasure of viewing it yourself, I'm sorry about the semi-spoilers here. It's just such a beautiful movie and no movie will ever compare. Not even a P.T. Anderson movie. If he were to make one that's better than Magnolia, I think I'd die a happy person.PS- If P.T. disagrees with any of my interpretations here, please email me or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really knew too much of this film until recently. Never hearing good or bad things on it and just knowing that it is similar to Crash (2004). So, instinctively I bought it thinking it will be amazing. To no surprise it is. This film is unlike everything else at the time but it does everything so well.There is approximately 8 stories intertwined, one where Frank T.J. Mackey(Cruise) is a chauvinistic male parading around on stage as if he is god to everyone. Another that deals with Earl Patridge (Robards), Linda Partridge (Moore), and Earl's nurse Phil Parma (Hoffman). See how complicated this is getting and that is just a small portion of how complicated this film is. As far as the acting is concerned it is just amazing, I don't like Tom Cruise that much but I would have to say that this film is his highlight. It is nice to see everyone acting so well and not just one or the other acting better.Everything is shot and lit beautifully and it seems that Anderson is just as amazing with the camera movements as he is with writing such a complicated story. Even if you do not appreciate camera shots you will appreciate a single just over 2 minutes (straight no cuts) long take in the school and studio, in the film. The one major thing that this film had was a great sense of emotion that just keeps building up more and more. As the viewer they suck you in with such a great and funny start where it will slowly but surely get to the climax. If you are watching this film for just a very intense and gripping story like Identity (2003) then you are mistaken. As much as this film is very complicated you will know what is going on half way through the film but that doesn't matter because when you arrived at the conclusion you will be so satisfied with the ending that it will not matter what you knew or didn't know about what was happening or going to happen. In myself saying that you will know the ending is false, because you will not I just say that you will have an understanding of what is going on in the entire film.The only problem anyone that I have heard has had with this film is that it is was too long, well luckily enough I love films that are long because for me they seem like an instant thing. Where you gain just enough time for everything to come to a wonderful conclusion. Such as Meet Joe Black(1998), Gladiator(2000), and Lord of The Rings (2001 - 2003). You will be thinking is this person on dope...LOTR is the perfect amount of time. Well I found that if many films need time to come to a conclusion, then they will. But Magnolia will come to its amazing conclusion without you even knowing it.The only problem with this review is that I can not give out information about the story or else I threaten to ruin the build up to the climax. Instead of myself ruining this film I urge anyone who has not seen or heard of this film to watch it because it is a beautiful thing to go to waste.</fullReview>

This seemingly shallow person (who actually has very shaky family roots) is a well-known part in the porno business. But when he starts having questions thrown at him, he gets so nervous, he quietly mutters to himself. Earl Partridge, his father, and the cause to his interview dilemma, lies bedridden with bone cancer and only a male nurse to talk to starts wanting nothing but to see his son badly. Occasionally popping in, is his daughter Linda Partridge who goes to get pills for her dad and then ***ends up getting pills for herself*** This circle connects end on end, and sometimes criss-crosses back and forth like a game of pong. The climax of the movie (and no there isn't 10) has all of the characters singing a song from the best soundtrack ever called "WISE UP."*** ****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The night I sat down to watch this movie was a night like none other. It actually started out as a fairly uneventful evening before i flipped the channel to CBC where I found myself captivated by the stunning imagery and personal associations of this film. It was twenty five minutes into the movie but I decided to watch it anyways. I got comfortable and concentrated on the sequence of events and their portrayal. Sooner or later a commercial came and went, each one making me more eager to get me back into the storyline of the movie. As the last commercial ends and the movie comes back on, the story takes setting in a game show arena where I notice a sign in the audience stating Exodus 8:2. Being somewhat of a religious man I decided to look into it. After investigation into this scripture, I understood it to be from the book of moses and it was a message that really had no meaning at the time, but I felt still had some significance. As I continued to watch the film, more and more was I drawn into the series of events that unfolded. Eventually the whole point or plot of the film, despite its irregular portrayal of events, came to me as a sort of epiphany or "revelation" so to speak when every trial the character was going through had significance to that scripture I had previously read. Everyone was having trouble letting something go. This was more than an ephiphanic awakening but more as a prophetic revelation/captivation by God. Furthermore, the film, I believe reaches its climax and thus begins the downfall. As the police officer heads back home after dinner with his date, is when things really get eerie. He see's a man climbing up the side of the wall and decides to investigate, but in the midst of turning around and pursuing the suspect, frogs begin to fall from the sky. I would not have expected this as part of the film, but yes, frogs did start falling from the sky. Now this was significant because the climax of the film was similarly representative of the scripture. The characters in the film could not and let these troubles go and yet suffered the consequences from scripture = smitten with frogs. When these events started to unfold, I did become stunned, but as the segment of the film progressed and transversed back and forth from one character to another, the part that shook me the most was at the house where the girl (cokehead) was. As the transition was taking place, I had a thought enter me head regarding the scripture and was questioning the validity of the scripture and questioned if something like that had ever taken place. No sooner did that question enter my mind then did the answer appear on screen in the corner of the picture in "but it did happen". Most remarkably was the message of the film in regards to portrayal of my life and its chronological events, and I'm sure relates to others also. This film is the epitome of films and if ANYONE could get me in touch with the writer/director of this film to discuss the impact it had on me will be much appreciated. Thanks for reading my quote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is magnificent, multi-layered, and mesmerizing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the wonderful film that is Magnolia, then I insist that you do so, as soon as possible. Filled with raving emotions, beautiful camera work and art direction, top notch performances, and a unique score from Jon Brion, Magnolia is a drama like non other. No, Tom Cruise is not the star of this film, while his character is interesting, so are all the others. Everyone involved with this film gives their best, which causes a high quality production. Don't let the 3 hour running time prevent you from seeing this picture. Yeah, that may seem lengthy, but you get so engrossed and hypnotized by what is being displayed on the screen, that you will probably find it hard pressed to turn away.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best modern directors. He is so ambitious, and has such a vision like no one else, that I give him all the praise that I can give. This is surely his best film. And with a film like this being only his third, then you got to admit that he has talent. I love Magnolia, not only because it is visually appealing, acted well, etc. But because it has some of the best, most unforgettable, moments that I have ever seen. Also, it has those random, unexplained moments that make life what it is.Magnolia is a one of a kind classic from an ultra-talented filmmaker.You really don't know what you are missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, this is really good stuff. It is very seldom I am so into a movie as I was when I saw this movie. After ten times, I am still as impressed as when I first watched this great and magnificent movie about tragedies and parallel histories that are tied in some way.Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise) is a known profile but what nobody know is that his real father is Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) who lies for his death. Partridge's production company produces the TV jeopardy show "What do kids know" of which the program leader is Jimmy Gator, who has Cancer and a troublesome relationship with his daughter. His daughter, Claudia, sniffs cocaine and meets a police, Jim, whom she goes out for a date with. Stanley, a clever guy, is a participant of the show "What do kids know". Donnie Smith was the cleverest guy when he as a child won a jeopardy show, but since the thunders met him, his life hadn't been that good. As the day pass, it turns out a horrible day - it rains, someone gets panicked, some secrets are told and the question is: Is everything that happen in the life a coincidence?An interesting movie with great actors. No doubt, Paul Thomas Anderson has directed a small masterpiece with a masterful story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I bought Magnolia having never before seen it, I had only heard some praise for it from some very reliable sources, so I took a chance on it. Luckily, I found it used for $10.99, so I saved a bit of money, but had I seen it before, I would have been willing to pay full price to get it.From the beginning of the film I was hooked. The opening scenes of "coincidence" were interesting and thought-provoking (though I knew they were all urban legends). I had no idea of how much meaning this would end up having. The movie had me immersed completely after an hour. I was totally engrossed in every single character and able to follow each of their stories (a difficult feat for directors to accomplish with so many important characters) with true passion and concern.Magnolia wasn't even over and already I was touched, amazed and in awe. I knew that I was seeing a movie that was going to change my life. When the scene involving Aimee Mann's touching song "Wise Up" came, I broke down in tears. I had not been this moved by a movie in a long time.Then came the end; the punchline, if you will. It takes some people a while to figure out the meaning, but it hit me right away. It was simply amazing. I was right. This was a movie like no other. I felt I had a duty to show this to as many people as I could. My sister and friend were there the first time I saw it and did not understand it. Even after explaining it to them, they did not like it. At least not as much as I had. Seeing this movie made me realize what i want to do with my life. I want to write and direct. And that is what I am going to do. If you have never seen this before, do yourself a huge favor and see it. You will not regret it. Yes it is lengthy (3 hours and 15 minutes) but it does not feel that long at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Watching A Week's Worth Of Soap Operas In One Sitting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is what a daytime soap opera would look like if filmed with a big budget. The pacing is the same, the interrelationships are the same, the feeling that nothing is really progressing is the same, and except for the profanity, the dialog is the same. Even the ending is straight out of the Luke and Laura arc of General Hospital.Further, the use of music is intrusive, or perhaps it was meant to mask that the characters aren't saying much of importance. I found it particularly ironic that at 2 hours and 20 minutes, all the main characters start singing "It's not over yet." The best thing about this movie is Amie Mann's contribution of original songs, but only if one listens to them from the soundtrack CD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating, mesmerizing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson has proved himself to be one of the wittiest directors working today. His imagination has come up with a movie that encompasses so many aspects of life and unimaginable personalities. Magnolia, being one of my all-time favorite, has been made that way as you can't resist its catchy magic. With loads of smart ideas and suggestive remarks, Magnolia is laden with a dose of sarcasm, as well. The plot, itself, is very convoluted with perspectives drawn from complete different points of view. The plot is about the lives of several people around the San Fernando Valley each of whom come from unique, yet peculiar, backgrounds. The important fact, surely the most entertaining, about these people is that they share a bizarre connection between them. Some are close relatives, some are friends and others just happen to come across each other. The commonness that they share is so oddly unraveled with the time passing by and each moment the characters meet each other is accompanied by a set of grotesque, weird, extraordinary events which, in meaning, vary from incomprehensible to fanciful. But, it's exactly this peculiarity that entertains the most and that requires every bit of your mind be activated in order to receive the message that the stories convey.Magnolia entices as much as it enrages. The bewilderment that it creates sometimes might feel nerve-racking but no way can it oust you from the circle of amusement. The cast is what makes all this plexus-tiring composition of ideas work. My all-time favorite actors John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and Philip Seymour Hoffman, were the most welcomed part of the entire movie. I should say that Tom Cruise did a marvelous job, as well, on playing an extremely eccentric person?I think it's a waste of time to talk about the cinematography or screenplay?they both caused a brilliant, sparking effect all along. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a study of true humanity. Everyone in the story lives in a "sh*t bag" and knows it and does nothing about it except the one moral center who is the policeman. He is trying to better himself in a sliding world. (John C. Reilly) This is odd because he actually sees on a daily basis what the world has to offer and should be the most dispirited. The weak people though are the least likely ones, the ones most cared for should be the strongest but are the most depraved, which is true to life all around us. This is not, as the site suggests, a story about friends and weather but about life and human emotion, capacity, depravity and need at its truest levels. I have seen most of PT Anderson's movies and this seems to be his style and he does it better than anyone. His movies, if you are open to the truth, are more than amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is beautifully acted and shot and the three hours do not seem to drag at all. Paul Thomas Anderson in my opinion is one of the best young directors about and I look forward to all his films. The cast is amazing with superb performances from in particuliar John C Reilly, Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. In what is an unusual role for Mr Cruise he plays a very eccentric character and he performs it very well displaying great emotion in later scenes with his dad.The music also plays a big part in the film as most of it is done by Aimee Mann. Their is one song of hers which is played out in the middle of the film with all the major characters singing along to it in their own environments. I think a lot of people would be put off by the running time and also with understanding what the film is mainly about. My own opinion is that it just tells us that peoples lives get tangled up with others not for any mysterious reasons but just because of coincidences. I would put this film in my all time top ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can I say about Magnolia...besides the fact that it is three and a half hours of pure cinematic beauty. Paul Thomas Anderson personifies what I search for in a director: he has an obsessive and meticulous attention to detail, and his stories always involve very round characters where no single one can steal the spotlight from the other, which is especially the case here in Magnolia. His cast not only includes some of my personal favorites in the business (William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman) but he demands and ultimately receives jaw dropping performances from each and every one of them. I saw an interview with him, where he said that the whole idea that was Magnolia began with an image in his head of the final shot, of a woman looking up to the camera and smiling, which almost creeps me out, because the 5 or 6 times that I saw the movie, prior to seeing the interview, that one final shot moved me more than any other sequence in the entire film, it still moved me to tears each consecutive time I saw it. The level of detail that surrounds this interweaving of characters and relationships amazes and frustrates me as well, for when I sit down to write, the first thing I try to emulate is Magnolia's style and structure, but 30 minutes later I'm trying a new approach because this is an act that is impossible to live up to and will never be matched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful but pointless meandering shuffle between misery and malice - 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS was an excellent story of ambition, success and failure, and the relationships that are born out of catharsis. Explicit and unflinching, it kept me hooked for the entire running time, every scene charged with emotion - joy, sadness, tragedy and wisdom all tied together it what was surely one of the best films of that year.I had heard many good things about this film: the great performances, the deft use of music, the stirring emotional crescendoes. The film does not fail in these respects. The mouth-watering cast-list will draw any film fan, and the standard of acting is very high indeed. The score is exquisite too, but unfortunately the good points end here. MAGNOLIA is, in short, a beautiful waste of time.(SOME MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW)The script of MAGNOLIA is woefully inadequate for such a long and complex film. Anderson enjoys hearing the word 'c**t' uttered fiercely - and with tiresome frequency - from the mouths of A-list celebs; I don't share his penchants. Just as Shakespeare's sprawling Troilus and Cressida is clogged with pleasantries that makes the dialogue trawl through mud, Anderson's multi-layered epic struggles to breathe beneath a roughly-wrought mesh of expletives. Pubescent boys might find it hilarious, but I doubt that this is the desired effect. I found it, after a while, very grating indeed.Anderson's film does not just contain one person dying of Cancer, but two. That's right, an extra 100% slow-death-by-cancer for your money; a sort of "buy one get one free." This struck me as an infuriating contrivance, but sadly it is the first of many. The film succeeds as a series of vignettes to music, but the threads are very loosely, if at all, tied together. My patience was exhausted after a couple of hours when I finally realized that it was all just a heap of spaghetti.There are many beautiul moments in this film that are beaten down by a constant crassness that, unlike the witty trashmouth philosophy of a Tarantino or a Scorcese, degrades the film and actually works against the realism of the scenarios. Nobody swears that much. Not even Ozzy Osbourne's guitar player.Anderson's film is, to me, a failed experiment. All credit to him for trying, though. MAGNOLIA is an ambitious film that aims high and misses the target, but that doesn't make it an entirely unrewarding experience. There are many sequences that are extremely powerful and the performances are remarkable. Sadly though, there are as many negatives as there are positives and to cap it all the ending absolutely stinks. Inadequate in the extreme, it had me gnashing my teeth and gouging out parts of my own face.(SPOILERS END!)To conclude, Anderson's film is ambitious, pointless, spasmodically exquisite - if I was being generous, I would call it a brilliant film that was born before it was properly formed; if I was not being generous, I would say it was a frivolous and depressing waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious movie that falls a bit short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many comments on this movie(recently seen on IFC)that range from "best movie ever" to brutal slating, that it's boring, pointless, etc. Well, I find that the film is between both of these extremes. It does a good job of conveying the grief of losing a loved one to disease or illness(having dealt with a cancer victim, and my grandmother's death due to a stroke, that emotion was spot on). The character tie-ins work very well, and do a good job of keeping things moving. Problem is, that I ended up not caring a whit about all of them, with the exception of the John C. Reilly/Malora Walters relationship; their awkward nature I found compelling. And the overuse of the F-word for dramatic effect was simply boring, and added nothing to the film. Other pointless elements included, but not limited to: gratuitous frog suicide, that stupid, completely unbelievable Julianna Moore scene in the drugstore(no pharmacist would act like that, I have to obtain many prescriptions and I get no looks nor frantic calls on the phone), Julianna Moore's OTT "acting": I don't believe for a moment, that some trophy wife screwing around on a husband that she married for $$ would suddenly get a "change of heart" and love him cuz he's dying(incessant crying and dropping F-bomb's ain't grief), the black rapper who I couldn't understand a word he was saying, that insipid, Aimee Mann soundtrack, and having all the characters at the same time sing her song at the same time was a throwaway element that made no sense. These rather pointless elements harmed what could've been a great film, as well as the inability for Anderson to bring all of these separate stories together, in the way that Altman did in SHORT CUTS and NASHVILLE.Full marks for Tom Cruise as the misogynistic motivational speaker, one of his best performances, ditto for John C. Reilly, Melora Walters, Phillip Baker Hall, Bill Macy, Luis Guzman(any movie that includes thischaracter actor get props), Henry Gibson, good cinematography.In the final analysis, this could've been better if Anderson would've reigned in his overindulgent script, had better dialogue, didn't overuse stedi-cams, eschewed the frogs and had an ending that made sense. Themes such as redemption and coinncedence(I submit the words of my mother, who states "Your mother doesn't believe in coincidences.")have been handled better by more accomplished directors. So, I give it 5/10 - not terrible, but not a great film that I could recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" was recommended to me by a young Buddhist friend. I can see why, having seen it now twice (and enjoying it far more the second time, though I liked it a lot the first). "Magnolia" amounts to a goofy three-hour meditation on coincidence and compassion. It also has the feel of a great labor of love, as though Mr. Anderson had been contemplating this project long and deeply. There are many experimental aspects to the film, and most of them work. The acting is nothing short of superb throughout, with the possible exception of Tom Cruise's work, which seemed to me merely better than usual for one of my least favorite performers.The drugstore scene and many others are painful to watch, the emotions portrayed are so believable--and it's possible for a viewer of any breadth of life experience to identify painfully with many, if not most, of the characters, too. For this film is also a long meditation on human frailty.I vote "ten." I don't see how a movie could be much better than "Magnolia," and I feel grateful to everybody involved in its making--even Mr. Cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Thoughts on Magnolia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Magnolia for the first time in November of '03. Since then I have taken quite a liking to this film. I believe this to be one of the best films ever made, and I'm not just saying that from some amateur movie goer p.o.v. Although this is lower on my ten best ever list, I still think it deserves to be on the same list as Tarkovsky's "Andrei Rublev," Kieslowski's "The Decalogue" and Fellini's masterpiece 8 1/2. What makes this film so good is that not only are the characters perfectly developed, but the screenplay is pretty much flawless. In addition to this, the direction is perfect; I absolutely love how PTA handles his camera with long shots and constant movement. The acting is brilliant, as every character is perfectly casted, and of course just the sheer way that this complex story is handled is great. The music also compliments the film perfectly, and in my opinion, it has probably the best opening half hr of a film I've seen, with a great character introduction. Hands down, a great film: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched this a couple years ago when it first came out. The emotion of it struck me. On second viewing, I am not as impressed with this film. My main problem is the overuse of music. I had to put on closed captioning to make out the dialogue in many scenes. The operatic music drowns out the dialogue. I realize the director is trying to connect all the different stories through the music, but I want to hear the dialogue foremost. Sound mixer anyone? Speaking of dialogue, I grew tired of the screenwriter's constant reliance on vulgarity, oftentimes the same words. I'm not against vulgarity in films. I love Quentin Tarantino. His dialogue, while vulgar, is inventive and less repetitious. The acting makes up for the film's weaknesses. This movie is bloated.Why is nearly everybody character in this movie screwed up? What a bunch of blamers and whiners.The only decent guy is the cop, played by John C. Reilly. There's no way a character like him and Claudia would ever actually be together. What a mismatch.That isn't believable. They're too different. I did enjoy some of the DVD extras, especially the outtakes in the color bar section. William H. Macy cracked me up when he had his vampire teeth in. (You'll know what I mean if you see it. It's about five minutes in.)</fullReview>

Every little detail, from the way the characters are set up, where objects are placed, help add up to the cinematic awe of it all. If you look closely, there are dozens of hidden meanings scattered throughout the film. I've seen the film on countless occasions, and I keep seeing something new every time. If you've ever seen a movie in your life, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. Don't even bother renting it, cause you'll be renewing it every weekend. Pure and utter brilliant filmmaking.

		<fullReview>Magnolia is such a wonderful film. It's over three hours long but it was shot, and structured in such a way that it feels like it an hour long, maybe even less. P.T.Anderson is an extraordinary director, he managed to make this complicated multiplot story completely realistic with a razor sharp dialogue, and at the same time he make us empathise with pretty much all of the characters involved....now that's a tough job. What's even more extraordinary is that he managed at the same time to make us sympathise with, once again, pretty much all the characters involved, even Jimmy Gator..now that's a very very tough job! I can't even imagine what he had to go through to make these characters come to life, make them as complicated and multi-dimensional as they are. And the story itself? What can I cay...wow. I mean it's not kind of a story that comes to you in a flash second...it's nothing like "oh I know, what if my protagonist doesn't know that he's actually dead....I have surprise ending now I can do whatever my little heart desires in the 2nd act". No this kind of story doesn't come spontaneously, it comes out of years of hard work and research, and I can't think of a single director nowadays, who can give us such a complicated, realistic and emotional portrayal of everyday tragedies experienced by human beings. I can't remember last time I watched a movie where I cared about all of the characters, where I sympathised AND empathised with all of the characters involved....in any movie where a SINGLE character convincingly exibits any of the human qualities/flaws I felt by numerous characters in Magnolia that's already a pretty good movie. Talking about empathy/sympathy/extraordinary writing/directing watch Punch-Drunk Love....P.T. Andersons is a truly original new talent that is set to become new Scorsese...keep up the good work!Magnolia 10/10 Punch Drunk Love 10/10 Boogie Nights 9/10 Hard Eight 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to be alone amongst people I know in adoring this film. People whose opinion I respect and generally share, loathe the film. They call it pretentious, overlong, meandering and pointless. The first time I watched it I might have agreed with one or two of these points and saw it as average, but every time I watch it again, I love it more and more. One thing everyone who sees the film agrees with though, is that every single performance is excellent. It's arguably the best work I've seen from Tom Cruise. Philip Seymour Hoffman is as good as ever, as is Julianne Moore but for me the most moving characters were Melora Walters and John C.Reilly's whose story is beautiful to watch, and preposterous as the events are, still entirely believable.A big factor in my growing admiration for the film is music, P.T. Andersons script was inspired entirely by Aimee Mann's music (some of the dialogue is taken directly from lyrics), and the score drives the film along. The first hour is unrelenting in throwing different characters at you, Anderson cuts between these characters with little explanation as to who they are and the music provides a pulse that when it finally stops for a second leaves you breathless.The most disappointing element of Magnolia for most (me included first time around) is the ending, but as the character of Stanley says, `This happens'. In a world where the most bizarre things happen everyday, is it not possible that this tangled web of related characters all have separate life changing experiences all on the same day.If you watched it and were indifferent, give it another chance it might become one of your all time favorites.10/10</fullReview>

"the bell once rung"....God, the ending is so perfect, the kid telling his Dad to be nicer to him, Phillip Seymour cleaning up the old man's belongings...John C. telling Claudia to be strong---and most of all, all of the viewers being told to "wise up"...and to be cautious of what you do in the present,cause it becomes the past, and the "past will never be through with you"....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of my personal favorite movies. But after reading some of the reviews here, and after talking to friends who have seen the movie, it is definitely not for everyone. A lot of people complain about a convoluted story, or pretentious direction, but to each his own.Let me explain why I liked this movie... First off, I don't watch movies just to be entertained. Entertainment is part of the experience sure, but that is not the sole merit by which I judge a movie. Art is about creative, emotional, political, and surreal expression. Viewing/listening/reading art is about your personal interpretation of or response to it and about how it affects you. Second, I believe good movies are not defined as good movies because of what they are about, but because of how they are about them (hopefully that makes sense).For some reason I was inexplicably drawn to Magnolia. All of the emotions expressed throughout the movie were so tangible and relevant to me. The style of direction and overall story arc of the movie is a bit exaggerated in comparison to real life, but the emotions expressed through the actors and the situations they are in are the most real and profound I have ever seen in a movie. The reason they were real, profound and relevant to me is because I could easily relate to most all the emotions and feelings in the movie, they correlate to feelings and situations I have experienced in my life.I didn't just like this movie because of the emotional connection and intensity though, it is also an extremely well directed, well acted, well written, funny and entertaining movie. P.T. Anderson handles multiple characters and storylines with skill comparable to Robert Altman, and successfully creates one of the most amazing film experiences ever. But as I stated before, this is not the type of movie everyone will enjoy. People who only watch movies to be entertained, or people who require a coherent and straightforward plot will probably not like it. Overall I rate it **** out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Magnolia is definitely NOT for everyone. It has proven that. But, in my opinion, Magnolia is one of those artistic movies that i REALLY enjoyed.Magnolia sets up with three stories of coincidence, which is the premise of this movie. It is all about coincidence. Which really reflects life itself, doesn't it?All except the raining frogs, of course!But what i am leading onto say is, is that this is a piece of art, and not everyone appreciates art, do they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia stays in your mind for days. The result is absolutely beautiful. I wished the movie never ended. Three hours is enough you might think, but it seems like one.The intro tells us bizarre story's about chance and fate, which follows with introductory shots of the main characters with great pace, guided by Aimee Mann's song 'One'. At one point all actors sing a long with a song called 'Wise up', at different places, but in the same state of mind; desperate. This is beautifully found and a very original way of showing a connection between them. The end provides us with a surprising 'solution' which is very pleasing. Then again a beautiful song by Aimee Mann is used to close up the film.All actors deliver an outstanding performance. Tom Cruise is brilliant, his best performance ever. He's capable showing deep emotions, of which we haven't seen too many. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a wonderful job nursing a former TV producer(Jason Robards) who's dying from cancer. Juliane Moore is in sorrow and looking for drugs to heal the pain. She plays her role very credible. William H. Macy is deeply unhappy about his fate as a wiskid and doesn't know where to put his love. John C. Reily plays a cop who's in search for any kind of human contact, and he does this in such a beloved way.They're all desperately looking for love and as an audience you are willing to give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece, one of the greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may accidentally write a spoiler, so watch out.Magnolia is one of the greatest movies that I've seen in a long time. It was up for three academy awards, and it deserved each one, but lost all of them. First Tom Cruise lost best supporting actor, for one of his best, if not the best, of his career. It really deserved best screenplay, but lost to American Beauty, which is also a great film. Also, Aimee Mann's "Save Me" also lost the deserved best song.But onto the movie. The movie's highest praise should come from it's acting. Great performances by William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Phillip Baker Hall, Jason Robards(last performance),Phillip Seymor Hoffman, the young Jeremy Blackman,John C. Reily, Melora Walters and the oscar nominated Tom Cruise.Paul Thomas Anderson's first, Boogie Nights, showed that he had talent, but Magnolia showed what he can do with it. The only movie I saw that has nine main characters, and manages to pull it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PTA's third film. First masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia was genious Paul Thomas Anderson's third film, after Sydney(Hard Eight), and Boogie Nights. First off, I must say, that this may accidentally contain spoilers.Magnolia is the story of one day, in the San Fernando Valley, that effects nine people for the rest of their lives. The main characters include a boy genious(the young Jeremy Blackman), an ex-boy genious (William H. Macy in his best performance since Fargo),a game show host (Phillip Baker Hall), his daughter(Melora Walters), a police officer in love(John C. Reily),a dying man(Jason Robards in his last performance), his young wife(Julianne Moore), his caretaker (Phillip Seymor Hoffman), and his lost son(Tom Cruise in a role that got him his third academy award nomination).First off, Magnolia has great acting, mostly by William H. Macy and Tom Cruise. All nine main characters deliver great performances. Magnolia was nominated for three academy awards, and deserved each one, but lost each one. Even though American Beauty was great, Magnolia defenitely deserved the screenplay award. It was very orignal. Tom Cruise lost to old timer Michael Cane. Aimee Mann's great song, "Save Me", fell short to win best original song.Lastly, I'd like to kiss PTA's butt. He is one of the greatest screenwriter/directors of the ninties and new millenium. He's in the ranks of Quentin Tarantino, and just a little lower than Scorsese. Anderson does great by juggling all nine characters and making it work, and pulling it off.Out of ten stars, I'd give it 9 and a half. It's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

I really like the bit whenever "Donnie the quiz kid" drives his car, being a brit "dreams" by Gabrielle bring back good memories, clearly it is a fave song of Donnie and seems to be the only track he has on his car stereo!!Remember don't take it personally its only a "freak occurance" !!!!!I cannot recommend this film highly enough...superb acting, superb cinematography, and excellent use of a superb soundtrack..... if you never see this film you do NOT know what you are missing!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the thing I like most about Magnolia is that it's the kind of film that grows with you. Weaving together the stories of several compelling characters, the film develops themes that are as big as life itself: sin, pain, forgiveness, and redemption. At its conclusion, it leaves the audience with no easy morals or ideas to come away with, instead forcing them to reach their own conclusions. As a result, this is a movie that I can watch time and time again, gleaning new ideas and insights from it as I grow and become more mature myself. Give it a chance, it might be able to do the same for you.Wonderful script, masterful direction, and brilliant performances aplenty. Also a wonderful soundtrack from underappreciated musician Aimee Mann. Give it a try, and prepare to be disturbed, shocked, and yes, even uplifted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't possibly find the right words to comment on this movie. It's so ambitious, so crazy, so heartfelt, and somehow it succeeds against all odds. I've had plenty of arguments with friends of mine who "didn't get it". They liked one part, or one character, or one aspect of the film but couldn't see the big picture. The frogs scene in particular lost a lot of people, perhaps appropriately so. If you want a realistic movie, look elsewhere. This movie requires a gigantic leap of faith to really appreciate, just like its characters need a gigantic leap of faith to find happiness. The fact that, despite all the bad things that happen and all the strange things that permeate this movie, most of the characters do find that happiness (or at least the strength to cope) is what makes this film great. This is one of the most deeply human movies you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and I enjoyed it immensely. I was planning to watch half of it, and watch the second half the next day. But I was enjoying it so much that I watched the whole movie and finished it at 1 AM in the morning. In fact, I am ordering its soundtrack online right now.In general, Hollywood movies are good at special effects, cracking jokes, action scenes, and love scenes, if you will. In a word, most of them are very commercial, without much food for thought compared with European and even Asian movies.But this one is a profound movie that is looking into lives of ordinary people, trying to reach for their souls, and trying to understand human nature and mistakes. If you think hard enough, you may even find traces of yourself in the characters.Highly recommended for people who like to think about things in life.</fullReview>

Tom Cruise, who has never been more than a face to me, really blew me away. The role was made for him. It also contained my favorite role of John C. Reilly's - it was almost toppled by his performance in Chicago but I still think he shines more in this as an actor. Julianne Moore is wonderful as well. Good heavens, I can't say enough. WAIT.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has a film made such an impact on me. It is nothing short of brilliant. It is Tom Cruise's best performance, bar none. He was made for his role in this film. Halfway through the movie I wanted to wring Julianne Moore's neck, she was incredibly irritating. However, her character was meant to be in complete and utter conflict, and it is nothing but a credit to her acting ability that she was able to ferment such a strong reaction. I can't remember ever seeing such powerful internal strife!Normally, I am not big on dramas, and I certainly stay as far as I can from tear-jerkers. But this film is so much more! It takes you full circle from laughter, intrigue, and gross exaggeration all the way to intensely emotional and heartfelt outbursts. There is almost an impossible amount of tragedy inflicted on (or by) the characters, but in the end, it is tied together in a very positive message. There is hope, fate does not control all the strings!The language is very strong, the images (particularly the rain of frogs) are very intense, I can't recommend this film to anyone who is easily offended. One of the characters is a cocaine addict, alcoholism is rampant, there are stories of physical abuse, drug addiction, homosexuality, fame addiction, and pathetic stories of past glories. All of this is neatly tied together in related stories which overlap each other in much the same way as Robert Altman's best work, Short Cuts. However, this film is far deeper than Short Cuts, it goes much farther and risks a lot more. And in the end, it is far more satisfying an experience.My advice? Watch this movie with someone. Then talk about it. Then read the trivia section of IMDB on this film to understand some of the imagery that you surely missed (there is so much, you cannot possibly have captured it all in one sitting), then watch it again. Each time you see it, you will understand a bit more of what PT Anderson was trying to convey. A thoroughly enjoyable and thought-provoking masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of pure genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only just seen "Magnolia", being highly dubious of it when it first came out for reasons that are now beyond me, simply because it is a dazzling, brilliant film, and in my opinion, one of the greatest and most important pieces of cinema ever made.I don't think since "A Clockwork Orange" has such an innovative and adventurously original film been made, and in the same vein as Kubrick, Paul Thomas Anderson writes, produces and directs this piece.It's difficult to give an exact plot outline, simply because there are at least seven different stories included in the picture, but most of them are, in one way or other, about love, and mistakes made in the past that come back to haunt people later. All of the stories themselves are engrossing and interesting looks at people's lives and they are woven together with a very fine web of links between characters or themes.It's the sort of movie, however, where if you don't get it, you might as well regard it as 'stupid' because it does have a certain odd element to it. In many ways it's like seeing a Beckett play put on the screen, with particular reference to the dialogue in some of the scenes, especially the supposed chemistry between John C Reilly and Melora Walters. But that's not what puzzles me about the reaction to this film. What really puzzles me is why Tom Cruise's performance was singled out so much from the rest of the cast. Sure, Cruise is dazzling in this performance and gives arguably his best to date. But I found that not one of the actors or actresses in this film gives a performance that is below brilliant. John C Reilly, William H Macy, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, all produce some of their best on-screen work to date in my opinion and I think a lot of them are very often overlooked.Magnolia is the sort of movie that raises a lot of questions and plunges you very deeply into thought. Essentially what Anderson has created is a modern-day masterpiece of cinema, and innovative work of bizarre genius that is both delightfully confusing and strangely moving. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Humanistic Opus Of Life Changing Proportions....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.....Wildy operatic, yet closely hewn to the heart, "Magnolia" is a monumental achievement. From its innovative opening frames to its jaw dropping closing, Paul Thomas Anderson's almost psychic grasp on our collective soul stunned me beyond words."Magnolia" is not content with demanding one's intellectual investment alone. It also makes audacious gambles, from breaking film conventions to insane challenges on our emotional thresholds. This may hence not be an "easy" film to sit through, but it ensures that shall this unusually heavy lifting pay off, people like me will embrace it completely. For me, it paid off big time.Via its myriad stories of surreal interventions, shared insanity and unrelenting pain, PTA's "rain of frogs" also demonstrates divine benevolence in more ways than one. It has intuitively opened my eyes to the depths and complexities of chance, faith and the human condition. And in so knowing, I can no longer recede to my complacent past.On a personal note, I am grateful for this timely gift. I went through a painful phase of grief in 1999/2000. Though I did not openly admit to it at the time, I was close to a complete breakdown. But by sheer coincidence, a film like "Magnolia" comes along. It lifted me out of my entangling coil. This strange 3-hour movie changed my life views. It helped me come to terms with the frailties of life, the transcience of loss, and the rejuvenating power of love. It turned me around.With the passage of time, "Magnolia" has since become one of my all time favourite films. And what a journey it has been. From then on, it never fail to fascinate me how the very good films out there possess the ability to heal and uplift. Therefore, I dare say to film lovers out there to throw caution to the wind, to surrender yourself to the wild transcendental opus that is "Magnolia". It might frustrate or even infuriate, but without taking that leap, you will never know if you can be touched by its redemptive possibilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have cried at the end of movies before but they were only bad movies. The mere fact that i sat through these films was enough to make me ball my eyes out. I cried at the end of Magnolia. But for the opposite reason.To put it frankly this is possibly the best movie ever made. It kept me watching all the way through and it didn't even seem like it was three hours long. I would have openly welcomed another hour or so to see what happened to the characters.In many ways this is a truly original film. I balanced the normal with the surreal brilliantly (watch as the main characters break into song two hours into it).I thought that the constant use of background music in the first two hours was genius as it kept you engaged and gripped. It also helped build up the film in a way that has never been done before.Performance wise I still think William H. Macy is the best performance in the film (watch the scene where he gets drunk-MAGICAL!). Cruise is good but there are better performances (and i am a fan of the Cruister) and for a film as good as this i was amazed that it didn't get and Oscar nomination for everything (yes including special effects for the raining frogs sequence).P.T. Anderson has been one of my favourite directors since i saw Boogie Nights and this film has put him to the top. He uses things that movies take for granted (music, characterisation) and turns them on their head. In the opening with the coincidences listen as music is played backwards. It is as if he is trying to make the viewer uncomfortable (see also Punch Drunk Love).In short this is my favourite film of all time as a i am a film student i have seen a lot of truly great films (Dead Man, The Sweet Hereafter to name a few) but this tops all of them. A must watch and a true gem.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Magnolia for the first time tonight.It is the best movie I've ever seen. It's the most perfect movie I've ever seen. And I'm damned picky about movies. Damned picky.If I had seen in in a theatre, I may have been distracted - if I had not been alone when watching it I may have been distracted - but I was so totally immersed(except for two instances - NOT faults in the movie) that I was in a state of just watching what was happening and I forgot that I don't like Tom Cruise, I forgot that there were actors acting, I forgot that I was watching a movie. And I'm not sure I've ever had that experience in my life.The two distractions - when I recognized Henry Gibson and Michael Murphy, Ithought of Nashville and then I thought how you could take Magnolia and playsix degrees with the cast and cover 40-50 years of filmmaking. And whenStanley had to pee I realized that I had had to pee for a while so I had to pause and get up and pee.All of the magnolia prints in the various scenes could have been gimmicky and distracting - but they weren't.The Fortean references could have been oh, too clever or oh, too cute, but they weren't.The taglines and plot summaries that I've read thus far here (and I haven't read them all) don't mention "This is something that happens" and, for me, that was the 'message' of the movie (if a movie must have a message). Birth, death, love, miracles - "this is something that happens."To add anything else is superfluous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic that will be remembered for years to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS AHEAD**A magnum opus of truly epic caliber any way you look at it, Magnolia is a classic that should stand the test of time to be revered as one of the most influential films ever. However, there are many people who will hate this film, who will find its ending completely absurd, and its premise too hazy to make any sense of what's really going on. My response to these critics would be A) the ending is set up in the film's prologue. Though the exact happening is not explicitly foreshadowed, nor can or should it be, director Paul Thomas Anderson reminds us upon the film's inception that things happen every day that cannot be explained, that sometimes when life seems so ordered, there's always the chance, though slight, of something happening to knock the world completely awry. And B) the premise of the film revolves around characters who are sharing the same life experience, in some way or another, with each other. I don't understand those who say Magnolia is too convoluted in its plot--maybe those people just didn't pay attention.Let's talk about the cast, and try to work out how they're related at the same time. Jason Robards plays Earl Partridge, a television tycoon on his deathbed. Julianne Moore plays Linda, his wife, and Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Phil Parma, his nurse. Meanwhile, Earl's long-lost son, Frank `T.J.' Mackey, is a self-help sex therapist played brilliantly by Tom Cruise in what's easily one of the top supporting performances I've ever seen. Philip Baker Hall plays Jimmy Gator, host of the longest running game show on TV, `What Do Kids Know?' Jeremy Blackman plays a young contestant on the show, while William H. Macy plays Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, a champion on the show in the 1960's. Gator's wife is played superbly by Melinda Dillon, and his daughter Claudia, sparklingly portrayed by little-known actress Melora Walters, is a depraved cocaine addict to whom he rarely speaks, for reasons we learn later in the film. John C. Reilly is a bumbling, though good-natured cop named Jim Kurring who comes to serve as Claudia's love interest. There are more characters, and even these here have more interactions than originally meets the eye, but you get the point. This is a film of sheer magnitude.Basically, the camera follows all these characters around for one day. Except this isn't just a normal day.it's the day when the proverbial crap hits the fan. Jimmy is dying of cancer. He visits Claudia and she screams for him to leave. Earl is dying even more rapidly. He intimates to Phil that he wants to see his son for a final time. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done, since they haven't spoken for over ten years, and Frank is a celebrity. Not the easiest guy to track down. Blackman's character, Stanley Spector, also seems set to explode--his father's dominance and the stress of being on a game show seem to be getting to him...meanwhile, Donnie smashes in the front of a 7-11, gets fired from his job at an electronics store, and has to forgo his planned corrective oral surgery (which he doesn't really need since he has straight teeth already). Linda is about ready to go off the deep end; she might as well be dying too, since she's downright miserable. Claudia snorts coke, cranks up her music, and consequently disturbs her neighbors, leading Jim to come to check out the scene. If it all sounds confusing, it isn't--Anderson, whose prior credits include the sprawling Boogie Nights, is a great storyteller with an uncanny ability to manage a great number of characters at once. What's more amazing is that these are all characters we learn to like, perhaps because we can empathize with the sadness that exists all around them.By the end of the film, we're ready for something to happen, and something DOES happen, and it might not make the most sense in the world at first, but after everything else that happens that day occurs, nothing seems too bizarre. Some have said that the climax of the film has Biblical overtones--this is definitely a possibility (there's even a sign that appears briefly on screen near the film's climax that suggests what Anderson's intent was), but I feel the ending is more a reflection of what can happen if everyone faces up to their problems. We'd certainly be living in a completely different world!I absolutely adore Magnolia. Yes, it's long (195 min.), misery-laden, and a wee bit (ok, quite a bit) over-the-top, but it doesn't seem long (I was disappointed that something so wonderfully visionary had to end at all), and all great art requires a degree of pretension. The writing is top-notch, Jon Brion's musical score fantastic, the acting brilliant--particularly Cruise, Hall, and Walters-and the direction nearly flawless. Magnolia is a stunningly original work that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a challenging film to see with a group of friends (for discussion afterwards!) or one to treasure on a rainy afternoon.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia is magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many great things to say about Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson {PTA} has put together one of the best ensemble cast in film history. What fantastic acting as a whole. John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jeremy Blackman, Melora Walters, Jason Robards, Melinda Dillon, Michael Bowen and Ricky Jay. Another great aspect of this film is the score and the soundtrack. Jon Brion does a terrific job composing and conducting this film. And his wife, Aimee Mann does a great job of written and performing most of the songs on the soundtrack. This is one of the rare occasions that I enjoy both the score and the soundtrack to the same film. PTA's directing is great again. I especially like how he stays with the action without changing cameras. The scene that shows this best is towards the end. PTA uses a single camera to go from car to car. He used this technique in two shots in another of his films called Boogie Nights. Towards the very end of the film, he goes from car to car with a single camera. He also uses this technique in the beginning of Boogie Nights in the club where he goes from person to person. The screenplay is so different and original from any other film I have seen. Magnolia is humorous, touching, sad, and emotional. One of the miss conceptions of this film was that every main character meets each other. Which is not true. Most of the characters do not meet each other. Only certain characters meet, mostly by chance. The film is about the past and how it catches up to you. `We maybe through with the past, but the past isn't through with us.' It's also about taking opportunities when they come to you. The film is about loving, caring, hating, hurting, helping, saving, having faith, not having faith, understanding, not understanding, being there for someone, regretting not being there for someone, regrets in general, etc. Pretty much what happens in everyday life. In my opinion, Magnolia was the best film to be released in 1999. Magnolia is one of only eight films, to date, that I give * * * * {Out of 4 stars} &amp; a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prove me Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 1999 when it first came out, before it's thunder. While most of the performances are convincing this movie left me with seemingly nothing, feeling, empty and bored. However, the thing that i found most interesting about this film was it's wide fan base. Upon initial viewing i made the assumption that anyone that knows anything about film would hate this movie. When i first started hearing good reviews from friends i thought nothing of it...most of them were not well versed in film and it was no surprise that this movie pleased them. It wasn't until i started hearing reviews from people i knew and respected on the subject of film that i began to wonder about this film. Allthough i haven't tortured myself with a second viewing, i am incredibly interested in finding out why people liked this film. The web board has left me with some answers, but i am yet to read about someone who actually likes good films. So far, i have discovered that most of the people who like this film follow a common criteria. And in the interest of hueristics, are around the age of 15 (probably around the age i saw this movie for the first time), and hold many modern films as among there favorites (Seven, Fight Club, Shawshank Redemption, etc.), these people are no surprise to me, while i too liked those films, i do not hold any of those among my favorites. I like this film because i think it seperates the filmically challenged from the well-versed, but i'm waiting to be proven wrong. In my opinion great film should test the boundaries of perception, show something we see everyday in a way that we've never seen it before. While this movie seems to do something like this, i feel that it falls far short, bordering on pretentious. In the great words of Coppola "there's nothing worse than a pretentious film". I hope someone can rise to the situation i'm presenting and give me some insight. thanks for your time -Benny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting alone makes this movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy watching movies without knowing what is going to happen beforehand, so it is my belief that this comment contains spoilers.Take a group of brilliant actors and say 'GO' must have been what happened here. John C. Riley is one of the most underused actors around (yes, he is underused - bit parts are not good enough for him), and it is great to see him in a film where he is let loose by the director. His role as the do-good cop is great, whose constant need to help people makes it no wonder he went for the coke-head with lots of personal problems. To me, this movie needed a little more resolution in some of the subplots, but I suppose with a run time of 2 hours and 59 minutes, they figured they were done. When I watched this movie for the first time, I never noticed the time, and was expecting at least another 30 minutes. People often ask me, "What is this movie about?", people often ask me, people afraid of a 3 hour movie. Despite the accusations of lesser educated individuals that this is a boring move with no plot, this is in no way a film like that, and if they cared to pay attention for a little longer and with a little more brain power than is required by the average John Woo joint, they would see a film that easily would end up somewhere in their 'top 5 all time favorite'. The movie can be summed up easily, and this is what I tell the aforementioned sheep when arguing about this movie - 'Everything can be suddenly affected by amazing events, and we are naive and persistent in that we still try to plan our lives'. This movie is about life, death, love, hate, deceit, crime, greed, and guilt, and how they all intertwine in everybody's life all the time wether they want it to or not. As for the plot, there is quite clearly one main plot - Earl Partridge is dying, and wants to see his son again, who he has not seen in many years since cheating on his wife and then walking out. The son, Frank T. J. Mackey, does not really want to see him, and we see by what he does for a living that this character is greatly affected by his fathers' earlier actions. There are several subplots stemming from the life of Earl Partridge (except the cop) - we see the life of a game show host who works for Earl's television station - we see the life of one of the game show's contestants, a brilliant child with an overbearing father - we see the life of Donnie Smith, who was a winning child contestant on the same show 30 years ago - we see the life of Earl's May-December wife - and we see the life of Officer Kurring, who exists to bring hope and help to each character he sees. As for the event many claim is a movie cop-out to bring the characters together, ask yourself - did the characters even needed to be brought together? And weren't they all in the process of being brought together anyway despite the event? If you follow - the mother was already on her way to see the daughter, the cop was already turning around to confront Donnie Smith, the kid was already freaked out by what happened on the game show, and the Frank was already with his father. The event is just something that happens, something no one can predict and no one can imagine. Is it any stranger that anything that has happened in real life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other people who have commented on this either think it is stupid or a waste of time. For those of you that are looking for a good movie and are reading this, then my first recommendation to you is Magnolia. The movie is brilliant. I really can't even describe the power it holds but it is there. Once you see it you like it, but don't like the ending. And wish you hadn't watched it.But the very next day you will realize(or I did atleast) this is more than just a movie. The true emotion and by far the best acting that I have ever seen, comes out much like a magnolia. The stories in it are all connected and they all have a meaning. And the ending(which is the best part) holds the most meaning. It really means, things are meant to happen and sometimes they do just that. They seem weird at the time but over more time you understand that it happened for a reason. So, if you are looking for a movie that is brilliant, with superb acting and deep meaning. By all means rent this. Then Boogie Nights.I am 13 years old and I got it. I suppose others just over analyze. Disliking something because it looked stupid and not what it meant. The ending I have just described is not all that it means. And there is many ways that I figured I can interpret it. The one above was just one of the many ways you can look at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm hardly a film expert, but you get to develop some instincts on movies from what you learn watching them. So when a Blockbuster clerk told me 'not to rent' this one "cause it's 3 hours long and everything is so complicated and unfolds so slowly.." he only made my mind about renting it. Boy, were my instincts right.Don't be fooled by the flower-like name: this is not a weepy delicate movie. Nor is it an adrenaline-packed movie. It's like a well orchestrated band - or like a carefully crafted car: everything works so in sync that the final result is visually, mentally and spiritually enjoyable. The trick is to watch it with kid eyes: don't try to guess, watch CLOSELY - and allow yourself to be surprised. As I watched the story unfold, I liked it more and more: amazing characters, a well crafted plot, dark-comedy moments, some surprising twists and a lot of provoking visual metaphors. No moral lessons here, just a fantastic portrait of our world on the stories of these persons and the (casual?) convergence of their obsessive quests- making them so similar in the end - all united under the fantastic music of Aimee Mann.Two images for posterity: Tom Cruise teaching his magistral class on being a man.. and the rain, the rain that pours..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I meet someone who has never seen ``Magnolia" I envy them the experience they are about to have.Ever since i first saw "Magnolia", i have changed the way i see my life and the lives of other people. I hear you all cry, "oh no, not another guy saying, this movie changed my life".. but it touched me in the most wonderful way.I remember when i watched this movie a couple of years ago, i was entranced. It had everything. Love, hate, happiness, sadness, death, life, inspiration, desperation, redemption and superb (and i mean SUPERB) acting!It focuses on the lives of a number of very different people all interwoven into a complex web of human feelings, but ultimately all coincide with each others. It is about love and forgiveness. Thats about it.I won't spoil it for you by going into plot details. View the movie without pre-conceived ideas, like i did. This is a challenging movie and it requires you to concentrate. It is one of those movies that must be watched alone or with another like-minded soul. Too get maximum pleasure you really must feel for the script and what it is trying to achieve. If you like movies like "The Fast &amp; the Furious", "Swordfish", et al, then please stay away. This movie is not meant for you. Some movies, like this one, are not meant for everyone.Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute genius and the cast much take great pride in achieving in what must be their finest performances.Well done to all involved in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the minute you start it, till the last second of screen time, Magnolia radiates. P.T. Anderson's genius writing and direction of this film stand out and give him definite solidarity in the film industry. The camera work is very unique and Anderson uses it to give each scene it's own capturing essence. And the acting is flawless. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymore Hoffman and John C. Reilly are stand outs. Overall, P.T. Anderson, as expected, has made another great film, but, this is more than just that.

		<fullReview>P.T. Anderson's 'Magnolia' is one of the most original films ever made. It isn't just a Robert Altman rip-off or a all-star Warner Brothers film of the 40's, it is truly original and brilliant. The first twenty minutes (the Ricky Jay sketch and Aimee Mann's 'One') are the best opening of any movie ever made, with the possible exception of Orson Wells' 'Touch of Evil'. Not for one second of the three hours does this film lag. It is vibrant, alive, and always watchable. The end may cause some questions and comotions. My feelings: what else could happen? There is so much insanity and chaotic feelings here that there could be no way that the characters could come together by the end, except if an event of great magnitude occurred, which it does. This is a great film. See it, and love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close too Pulp Fiction and Schindler's list as best of 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PTA is one of the finest of his generation of filmmakers. 'Magnolia' is a true art film. For those who like to use the word 'pretensious' in association with this film, I ask this, what else is art? I've seen this film at least 10 times, and each time I come away with something new, to add to the many ideas and themes thrown out. Yes, it is a long movie, and not for most of the MTV generation. However, this only adds to the impact of the film. It is funny, sad, chaotic, empathetic, optimistic, dark and complex. All characters in this story are linked by the gameshow. In the beginning, Mackey comments, "on the game of life," as the gameshow is but a metaphor for life, and the films backbone(or the bud of the magnolia, where all petals originate). It is not known who will win, or what surprises the other contestants have, and whether or not the game will be canceled. In other words, it is about the train that blindsides you at 4 in the morning, derailing your day and setting your month on fire. Furthermore, it is about how we deal with these suprises, in midst of planning for tomorrow. Our planning is just as good as predicting the weather, and we as the viewers are given forecasts, and left wondering if planning is worth our while amongst all this chance, coincidence and chaos. However, we are mortal, and what else can we do but try and plan where the day takes us.The ABSTRACT scene in which many of the characters are seen singing along to an Aimee Mann song is just too show the common confusion we all share when we make bad choices that conflict with the aforementioned chance, coincidence and chaos. People have a problem with this scene because they are more accustomed to immitation rather than innovation. Take notice in the second half, when Mackey flips the table amidst the conference on "seduce&amp; Destroy." It is here he realizes he has become just as his father. This is character development at its best. "Magnolia" is subtle, like the flower outside your window collecting last nights predicted sunlight. "And so it goes,And so it goes...in the Blah,blah blah"...that you need to see this movie. 10 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's damn close to the truth. Sure, movies aren't new, and there have been many great movies made before it and I acknowledge how that statement would sound preposterous. But subjectively speaking, it's the greatest movie I've ever seen. As concisely as I can put it, it was the first movie that reminded me what it felt like to, well, feel at the movies. It really says something about a director when he can make 3 hours feel like 90 minutes and then have time slow down completely once you've left the theatre. When I think about the movie in retrospect, what remains most striking is the bravado of it all, the brash, impetuous, unapologetic push of everything. On closer inspection, I find it to be a movie that ignores many of your archetypal great movie rules -- too many to list. But none of it matters because all of it feels necessary. It's a deeply personal and moving -- without having to resort to that whole abysmal self-declination of the human spirit routine -- movie. The whole piece just continually excited me with what it felt like break out of any medium, to suddenly transcend all that has come before you to say what just needs to be said without coating -- "from the gut" as Anderson put it. Watch as I sound pretentious: I'm sort of a cineast, and although I've seen 90% of everything on most reputable film lists, I still think this movie is the best, ever. Maybe that's just how we're all going to work, we see a movie in our time and it remains the greatest, lingers the longest in our memories; nothing anyone will say will change that because that first is the only, and then you can call someone an idiot for proclaiming whatever comes out in 2008 to be their greatest. I'm sleepy and I don't know why I wrote this, except I should've written it a lot longer ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's official: Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius.He's made an intimate emotional epic that is frequently moving, never dull, fantastically photographed, featuring the best actors working today (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly...) as well as the best performance of Tom Cruise's career (he was TOTALLY robbed at the Oscars). The only perceivable flaw is that it's too stylized - the dialogue, the cinematography, the film's rhythms. The reason Anderson gets away with it is that he and his actors create real characters who feel emotions the viewer can relate to. And his parlour tricks aren't there for the sake of weirdness. When everyone sings along to Aimee Mann's song 'Wise Up', for instance, the gimmick feels perfectly natural because it conveys the movie's (very basic) theme of universal pain. It seems like some sort of miracle that this long, technically complicated, multi-character movie gels, but it's not; it's simply a testament to a director with a strong, clear vision. The interesting thing is, Anderson has created a symphony of pain that is not difficult to watch; I've seen this three-hour movie seven times or so to date, and I never get tired of it.</fullReview>

Remarkably (especially that the film is 3 hours long) the most important aspects of the story are unspoken, but 'between the lines' The nervous ticks, the sadness in the eyes, the pain, the suffering, unspoken but clearly obvious to anyone paying attention.This is one of very few movies I have seen that has the ability to alter the way you look at the world.....and I haven't even mentioned the frogs......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not bore you with details about why I love this film. I probably love it for the same reasons that you either love or hate it. The soundtrack gets major play in my car and should in yours as well. I am writing in response to those that asked for interpretations on "the frog scene". Well: about a year before the movie was released, I saw on the back of a cereal box a little tidbit of information about this odd happening. I don't remember details like where or when or even how, now, but I do remember that it said that at one point in history, a city was rained on by frogs. Now, it said it rained about 100 or so I believe, but PT Anderson added a few(a lot) more just for dramatic effect. So the fact that this freak happening really did happen even though it is sooo unbelievable, went along with the theme he establishes with the opening scene. There is also the reference to the bible passage that speaks of the raining frogs. This passage, Exodus 8:2 which is shown in various spots throughout the movie, is about God sending down frogs to punish the Egyptians that would not let the Israelites free. You can most likely relate that somehow to the story, ie. the characters struggling for freedom, etc. but from interviews I have read, PT Anderson didn't mean any biblical undertones and only added the Exodus 8:2 references after he finished writing the script. So, mostly the frogs are there because, as the film says, you wouldn't believe it if you saw it in a movie, but it really did happen. Either way, its a really good movie.</fullReview>

Ultimately, one of the best movies ever, MAGNOLIA is a brilliant, radiant work of art that will live forever. The film is a towering masterwork. No one should miss seeing this film. This masterful film should have garnished several Academy Awards. Best Picture included. If you don't like this movie, then there is something seriously wrong with you. And you can quote me on that. I recommend this film to everyone. Especially since we get to hear the songs of the very talented Aimee Mann. Thank you P.T. Anderson. MAGNOLIA gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERI won't go into a long explanation of the movie as several people have already done that. I can only state that this is my favourite film of all time. It may be 3 hours long, but there is nothing wrong with that. I don't feel that there is anything redundant in the movie, nothing that should be cut out just for those people who can't concentrate long enough.If you are a movie fan that likes big explosions and plots that are seemingly written on the back of a cigarrette packet then give this a miss. If you like movies that make you think and make you feel, then give this a go if you haven't already.I loved everything about it, including the rain of frogs! I especially loved the final scene, where Claudia listens to Jim. The song playing (Aimee Mann) almost drowns out what Jim is saying. What is being said however, isn't so important as Claudia's expression. From depression and trepidation she suddenly smiles. Suddenly you know that she is going to be OK, and maybe that's a sign that the other characters can get through their problems too.People have complained that the movie doesn't tie up loose ends. Life isn't like that though. I think if every character were to suddenly reach closure on their problems at the end of the movie, it wouldn't work and would cheapen the movie. It's enough to end with the feeling that most of them have real hope of redemption.A masterpiece of a movie.One word of warning to those with only a VHS copy of the movie. Do yourselves a favour and buy the DVD version. You need to see the whole picture. The 'pan and scan' version can never do the movie justice like the widescreen version does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambitious, daring, compelling, intelligent, well-made and emotionally engaging. I loved the movie so much as it compelled me to question the way i lived thus far. It was a thoroughly life changing experience, a rarity considering the normal fare in the moviescape. The use of music was exceptionally effective, as the music itself became a character in the movie, and a part of all the characters in the movie. Aimee Mann is hauntingly sad. I wept and laughed and wept some more. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Magnolia, I had to say "Wow!". I had always wanted to see this movie and the length of it never turned me away. While watching it I realized you really had to pay attention and watch the movie completely with no interruptions. There's about 6 separate stories that play out throughout the movie and I never found it confusing, but it can be if you don't pay attention. The acting is amazing, every single actor in the film does such a great job and the film plays out perfectly. Everything about Magnolia is all really well done, from the plot, to the music, to the acting, and the (unique) ending. Watch Magnolia if you wanna see an amazing movie with perfect acting and an unsuspecting ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie not afraid to rise to another level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this just after watching Magnolia and I have to say - it is hard to put into words what I have experienced. I knew little about what this movie entailed except that it was about the intricacies about the lives of a group of people but I have *never* been so wrapped up in a 3 hour movie - to actually feel there swallowed up by what was happening in front of me.This movie is the type that people come out of the cinema and talk about and realise that everyone had interpreted the movie differently - so much differently in fact that they could have in fact seen a completely different story. The aspects of the situations are something that every viewer will understand and they will touch everyone to a degree. It is almost capturing the essence of life, the pitfalls and the joys, the fact that happiness can only be realised after one understand sorrow and so on in a dream like story.My point is that this is the sort of movie that really can 'cleanse' you - for me it has almost drained away all the worries from my head and its hard to put into words why. I suppose it is that when you see something with clarity, you are then much more at ease. This may seem all unclear but my advise to you is that this movie really is the best I have seen - the acting is magnificent, the direction is unbelievable and the depth of the story needs to be seen. And the movie is simple about life and 'us'. But captured like never before.Please see this movie if you ever get the chance and give it all your time; at the very least you will come out with the idea that you definitely did not waste 3 hours of your time and at the most, you will feel that you truly have experienced something remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day in the Life of Nine Very Normal People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes. I said normal people. Who in this world does not have a flaw or problem they must deal with? Who doesn't hear of people who deny their parents who left them as children and have grown up to hate them? Who feel lonely during some point in their lives and need companionship? Who faces illness, cheating on by their spouses, who feel they need to profess some sort of love to which no one wants? Normal people. What makes this movie great is how real each of the characters are. This is not like in movies where people are perfect and face no personal problems. Their problems are believable as problems people face everyday. It makes you wonder who in your own life is affecting you and not realizing it. Some of the characters were intentionally affected such as Officer Jim and Claudia. They are unintentionally connected to Earl Partrige, who endorses the television show her father,Jimmy Gator, is host. The list goes on.Tom Cruise was well deserving of his Oscar nomination for portraying Frank T.J. Mackey. His character started off as sexist and a manipulator. Yet later we see why he does what he does. That there is much more to him, showing his sensitive side. How this movie was not honored for its' achievements I do not know. Yet it is a treasure none the less. P.T. Anderson did a magnificent job directing this film, and people will be honored to watch one of his films. Set three hours aside tonight and watch this movie. See nine normal people they deal with their problems through their own ways of healing. This is a powerful drama, one which will leave you with tears in your eyes. Highly recommended.MJR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! The moment I first watched this fantastic film, I knew I had to see it again. After viewing it a second time, it was quickly added to my DVD collection and dubbed one of my most favorite movies. Just thinking about this film and the complexity of the script boggled my mind. How did Mr. Anderson (the director) put it together with such style? The length of the film (3 hours+) did not bother me at all, as I was engaged the entire time. However, I do recommend watching it on DVD, not VHS, as having to switch the two tapes can become very tiresome (not to mention breaking up the film at an awkward moment). Anyway, give yourself plenty of time to watch and reflect on this masterpiece; you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the smart ones will get the irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Director P.T. Anderson's `MAGNOLIA' is the study of nine lifes in one day in San Fernando Valley, California. Brief: these nine stories are somehow connected and every figure seems to have one heavy character flaw or at least is in pain and trouble. The interconnected characters are shown in a way that reminds us of Robert Altman's `Short Cuts' where the stories come up teaser-like too.One of these stories is the one of Donnie Smith, played by William H. Macy. First Donnie's famous childhood is presented, which is remarkable because of a record he set up in a game show in 1968, as a child prodigy. The great amount of money he won at that time helped him with financing his life till now. The fact that he never had to work for his needs made him grow up to be a pathetic loser, who has abundant wants but doesn't know what to do when broke. As we can imagine, now Donnie has still wants, but no more money. He is in love with a bartender, wearing braces and in order to impress him, Donnie things he needs oral surgery too. (This is only one of tons of dreams floating around his head - how fitting it is, then, that singer Gabrielles' pop song `Dreams' recurs troughout the movie as his personal anthem.) But when he is fired from the company, that lets him work there only because of the atvertisement Donnie's famous name (`Donnie the Quiz Kid') provides, he decides to break into the office of his former boss.He steals the necessary money, leaves the company by getting into his car and suddenly realizes his ridiculous behaviour. We hear him saying "What am I doing?", before he decides to break another time into the office, but this time with the intention to put the stolen money back.Right at the moment when Donnie climbs up the ladder that leads into the office, it starts to rain. It rains not just water, as we are used to it, but it is a pour of bullfrogs. Millions of frogs start to fall from the sky, so that it is impossible for Donnie to escape. When he realizes the unusual phenomenon, he looks up into the sky (we see him look into the camera which is in a bird perspective). Then we are put into the perspective of Donnie's eyes and see a frog falling on us. When the frog reaches Donnie / us, the camera changes again to the bird perspective and we see Donnie seriously falling on the asphalt in a way that all of his (front) teeth break. There is a camera close up on his mouth and the realism is not only created by the blood, but also by the sound of the breaking teeth. This sound is stressed by the nonexistence of the backround music, which usually accompanies the scenes throughout the film. As already said, we see his face in a camera close up laying on the pavement. And it is the directors' scornfulness, that an ugly frog falls in between the camera and the face. While Donnie lays miserably on the ground - miserable as his whole life actually is - a police officer (another character out of the nine lifes) drags him out of the fatal rain. It seems to be great irony, that of all, especially his teeth are lost.It probably does not have to be discussed that Anderson refers to the bible with the fall of frogs. On a closer look we can see that there are a lot of hints guiding us to Exodus 8:2. For example, in one scene there is a suicide of a young man. The date of this incident is March 23rd, which is the 82nd day of the year. However, unlike the bible, Anderson's plague of frogs seems to have a catharsis-like effect on his people. Not only on Donnie Smith, but also on all the other characters.`Magnolia' may very well be a film that confuses more people than it strikes with admiration. Many people will probably have difficulties with accepting the form of narrative logic, which is so different from usual films they have got used to. Another difficulty is to find a movie that summarizes American society better than this piece of art. To me, it could even be compared with Sam Mendes' `American Beauty', not only because of its sharpness, but also because of the hidden irony. Though its length of 3 hours, I think `Magnolia' is a must see for people looking for a young, passionate and at the same time courageous director, that seems to ignore all possible critics, who do not want to accept these films, where logic has to be left at the door.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To encapsulate a movie like MAGNOLIA for someone who hasn't seen it is...well...difficult. A film this daring and uncompromising in vision will be hated by some, loved by others. As for me, I loved it.It seems that director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson wasn't content with making a movie about just anything, so he made a movie about everything, as big as life itself. The characters are so real that we may feel we have met them before; their struggles and doubts are the same struggles and doubts as the human race. Their problems are, to them, huge and insurmountable. In the end, however, their problems are seen as small in the face of something so much bigger, so much more amazing.I'm not going to say any more, because half of the fun in watching this movie is being amazed by the unexpected. This is my all-time favorite movie. I'll never forget the first time I saw it.If you're about to watch Magnolia for the first time, I envy you the experience you are about to have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But it did happen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is just a wholly original and engrossing film that gets better with additional viewings. Paul Thomas Anderson has taken a page from Robert Altman and managed to somehow surpass the master of the large cast film with the memorability of the characters and the quality of their dialogue. It's difficult to describe exactly what it is about this film that makes me view it so frequently. I think a big part of the success of the film is its sensitivity to human frailty and seems to uncynically believe that what people truly need in life is just a little bit of compassion, understanding and someone to love. It sounds trite, but Anderson pulls it off incredibly well. Of course, the movie wasn't just touching thematically, it was filled with fantastic sequences, from the opening narration sequence displaying the bizarre "coincidences" of history to Tom Cruise's over the top male power seminar. Speaking of Tom Cruise, this is easily my favorite performance by him in any film and the other actors aren't slouches either. Just look at the cast: Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Ricky Jay, Tom Cruise, Philip Baker Hall. All of these performances are well nuanced, funny and heartfelt. Magnolia is a movie that is just indescribably great for me. I own the DVD and have seen it around ten times, introducing as many friends to it as I can at any given time. When I look back at the 1990s in ten years, I imagine this will be near the top of my list of favorite films from that decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie three times. I own it on DVD. I recommend it to people. But I have no idea if I like it or not. Isn't that weird? I am so caught in the middle that it makes it impossible for me to decide. There are a few factors that swing me both ways:The editing - Most people think that Magnolia needed to visit an editing room once or twice (at least), but I personally kind of like the un-cut style it has. It's very different, and it makes the movie quite long, but at least it's original.The length - 3 hours? It's long... but I think that in order to have the plot that it has, and the depth that it has, it needs an extra hour to fit everything. It does a pretty good job of using up the time it takes.The plot - I'm not usually the quickest person when it comes to following screwed up plots (although The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite movies) so this one took me a few viewings to understand. However, I think that finding the way people connect to each other and the hidden influences they have on each other makes the movie more fun than annoying.Overall I would have to give the movie an 8. The acting was excellent. William H. Macy is so... pathetic! And Tom and Julian are so beautifully... sadly... amazing. I don't know how many people will be able to stand the plot, length, and editing, but if you are able to, I highly suggest this movie. It will really make you think about people in your life and unresolved issues between you.********8 Frogs. Err... stars********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is a beautiful and unique film that captures everyone of the emotions real people feel. Its amazing to see a film that summarizes reality so well when one is so used to unrealistic love stories and ridiculous action adventures. Julianne Moore's performance as Linda Partridge is stunning, however, all of the actors make brilliant portrayals of their characters. This film is very moving, perhaps because it is so down to earth, with each character holding traits that viewers can relate to. Don't get me wrong, this film is no soap opera, but rather an artistic and hypnotic portrayal of human relationships and reactions, that touches every one of our emotions and ties together as a brilliant film. Definitely 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is definately one of the three best movies I've ever seen (outside of "The Godfather" and "Schindler's List"). There is so much I can say about it. When I first saw it, I didn't pay much attention. I saw it again a few months ago, and within a week, I had bought the DVD and seen it three more times.The direction is flawless. In fact, everything in this movie seems to be flawless. There is not a single word that could be cut without altering the movie as a whole. From the opening montage, set to Aimee Mann's haunting lyrics of "One" all the way through Julianne Moore's tantrum at the pharmacy, Jason Robards' deathbed regret speech, William H. Macy's breakdown at the bar, and Tom Cruise reduced to rage-filled tears at the bedside of a man he hates, "Magnolia" had me captivated.Yes, it is 188 minutes, but people please!! A baseball game is about that long, and they aren't boring. If you pay attention to the characters instead of length, this movie will have a serious impact on you.Of all the amazing performances here (just about every role was perfect), the two particular standouts for me were William H. Macy and Jason Robards. When you get a glimpse of a character's whole life through a few small gestures, you know you're watching a genius at work. Such was the case while I watched Quiz Kid Donnie Smith make a fool of himself in front of a bartender who he thinks he's in love with. And when Jason Robards sruggles to remember his son's name, it almost brought tears to my eyes. You can tell that so deeply regrets his past decisions that he'll do anything to feel loved again.This is the kind of movie that must be seen. Some people may think that "Magnolia" is a world of crazies and exaggerations. I beg to differ. These are normal people. Not many people can honestly say they've never made a bad decision. Paul Thomas Anderson is just showing the world as it is, tragic as it may be.10/10 (If I could rate any higher, I would!! This is not just a movie, it is a work of art)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most positive review i could write.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is, without doubt, my favourite film. I first saw it on video about a year ago and I was blown away. Paul Thomas Anderson is an incredible writer, boogie nights is evidence of that, but from the first five minutes of the movie with its quirky prologues and the "one is the loneliest number" introduction (as you are introduced to all the characters over Aimee Mann's phenomenal soundtrack) I was hooked. I'm a fan of the writer Douglas Coupland and this film had a lot of similarities to his character and plot structures. A film where Tom Cruise is billed as a supporting actor to a perfectly tight cast is one in a million. He is not allowed to go beyond the boundaries of his character and Anderson never 'hollywoodises' his films purely for the benefit of finance or actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors around today, (look at Almost Famous where he steals the show) and in this film he is again superb; along with Moore - "SHAME ON YOU!" brilliant! - and Macy. Anderson's excellent use of young versus old, relationships, spirituality and the impact of the visual image is sublimely used again in Magnolia. The attention to detail and to soundtrack is perfect. My only criticisms would be the amount of swearing - but that only creates a greater suspension of disbelief - and that it is perhaps too long, but this only provides more space for Anderson to work his magic. It is a film I could watch again and again and never tire of. It also has the most wonderfully tied together ending of anything I have watched. Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first i was astounded at the breadth of opinions of this movie. Never have i known a movie to have such polarised views. But the more i think about it, the more it seems to make sense.This movie is all about heart, its about being in love, to be loved, about greed, emotion, pain, joy, respect, heartache, jealousy, suffering, redemption, and lastly hope.Anyone that has the humility and courage to truly look at their own lives, and the lives of those around them, their friends, their neighbours, their family, and the people they meet in their everyday lives, will have been able draw something personal from this movie.The storyline, superbly dense, weaves through the lives of nine characters, who are ultimately linked. Andersons's characters at times overly dysfunctional and psychotic, maybe its an insight as to where society is or is heading, at the least its a warning to all of us.The positive and negative reactions to this movie, is as much a reflection of the people and the world we live in, and ultimately tells us more about ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE 90'S</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a strong 1999 year, Magnolia stood at the top with movies Being John Malkovich and American Beauty. Like Being John Malkovich, it was virtually ignored by the Academy Awards except for a best supporting actor nomination for Tom Cruise. This is film blasphemy considering how well made and engrossing Magnolia is. Best picture and director nominations should have been automatic, as well as a supporting actress nomination for Moore. Sadly, none of these things happened and I have lost a lot of my faith in the Academy (even more so now that Gladiator has won best picture of 2000). Hopefully people didn't miss this movie because of the lack of awards, but if you did, I suggest checking this title out. Although that's not to say it's for everyone. If you are one of those ignorant fools that believe the Matrix and American Pie are all time great movies I suggest you check out Exit Wounds or something like that. That being said you also have to be in the mood to sit and watch for three hours. For me, and many others, the three hours flew by, but for some people with ADD, the length might be a problem. This movie was made on a $30 million budget, unbelievable when you consider the wealth of talent in the actors and expensive looking stage designs. When it's all said and done I believe this will go down in history as a sleeper classic that people will come to appreciate in the years to come.</fullReview>

It has the most interesting characters in a film, since pulp fiction, from the lonely cop to dying man, they are all intresting, and all add something different to the film.Tom cruise gives the best performance as the tragic man, he really can ACT. The film my be three hours long but its so good you won't mind, The highlights include the whole of the game show,cruise being interviewed, the cop drinking the woman's coffee(its great trust me) and the first five minutes(fantastic). Anyone who does not like this film, really only likes dumb films that have car chases , or does not understand it, or does not like good movies. This is a classic, because the film is more of a experience, than a movie, its unlike anything that you have ever experienced before.Watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fundamental film about the fundamental things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: this comment contains spoilers)It has been a good many months now since I saw this movie, a circumstance that I find interesting after having read other user's comments, which often mention aspects of the plot that I had forgotten. Time tends to extract the details from our memory, and to leave behind only the fundamentals. And the fundamental aspects of this movie that I distinctly remember, and which --in my opinion-- make it such a valuable movie, are:It is deeply moving. This is a rare quality nowadays, when movies are so filled with visual effects and noise, in a desperate effort to thrill and catch the viewer's attention, that they are achieving quite the opposite effect: the audience gets number every day. 'Magnolia' is everything about humans and humanity, and precisely this is what makes it so interesting. I remember sitting and watching it without even breathing, as if I had been in a trance. I did not 'notice' the three hours at all!It has wonderful music. Apart from the songs, I liked the constant background music very much. It helped building up a wall of tension, which kept growing and growing during the entire movie, parallel with the development of the character's conflicts -- until it reaches a point when heaven falls down in the form of frogs.It is one of the most religious films ever. There may be some who like this aspect, and some who don't; as may be some who see the movie in this way, and some who don't. But I think that religion is everywhere in this movie, in every effort of the characters to overcome their worries and find true love (they are ALL in search of it, not just William H. Macey, who says so aloud), and of course in the symbolic 'frog rain'. Religion isn't really about intolerance and prejudice: it has to do with the search for happiness, the urge for transcendency -- and, yes, with morality, which in the end is nothing more than choosing 'good' over 'bad'. Why, if not for moral reasons, would Julianne Moore's character cry over the fact that she had 'had other men's c***s in my mouth'? After finding the love she had been searching for with whom she less expected --her own husband-- she repented for her past actions. And since such past actions obviously had been pleasurable, the one reason for repenting was a spiritual comparison between sheer sexual pleasure and the deeper joy of true love. I found this moral framework in Anderson's 'Boogie Nights', too: near the end, a title appears, which read something like 'the final step on the long way down' (I don't remember the exact wording anymore). But this little hint clearly revealed that Anderson is, indeed, very aware of what is 'up' and what is 'down'. Many people might say that there is no objective 'good' and 'bad', but I think that, if one sits down quietly (hard nowadays) and looks down to the bottom of one's soul, the difference will become evident -- and (maybe surprisingly to some) such conclusions will not differ that much from one person to another. For me, 'Magnolia' is in its entirety about a soul-search of this kind.It is a desperate movie. This is the one word that comes to my mind when trying to describe the film: 'desperate'. Everybody is drowning in remorse, in guilt, in fear, in the unbearable desire of breaking loose from pain and finding peace of mind. I felt like being on a ship that is fighting all the way through a thunderstorm, trying to arrive at a sunny, warm and quiet harbour (again a religious metaphor?). Maybe this is why it rains so much all the time.It has an encouraging ending. Unlike what some viewers think, this movie has a very clear ending. It doesn't just unexpectedly come to a halt. I experienced it like this: after the tension of the plot has raised to an almost unbearable point, the frogs start falling out of the sky. For me, this represented the turning point, the purging punishment for everybody's sins, after which one can start anew. The slowly developing smile on Claudia's face (the last scene) is nothing but a sign of hope. After all, if it wasn't for hope, would the world still be worth living in, with all of its troubles?I sincerely wish to congratulate and thank Mr. Anderson for bringing out such an excellent film. It touched my very soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that everyone alive should see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a real film. And I mean that in the most literal sense. Every movement of every character, every word uttered, and every situation in this movie is truly believable. You and I have been through the emotions that are in this film, and Paul Thomas Anderson knows it.Firstly, this is ensemble acting to drool over. There is not one bad performance in this film. I'm an avid 'Usual Suspects' fan, and not since that movie have the cast impressed me as much as they do here.Julianne Moore is outstanding as the rich, deceiptful wife at the end of her teather, rattled with guilt. William H. Macy gives a heartfelt performance too as a boy genius with nothing but his fading reputation and a whole lotta love to offer. Jason Robards (RIP) is superb too. I've never seen a dying man played with such bitterness and regret, it was truly an eye opener to see such an honest portrayal. John C. Reilly boosts his growing reputation by outdoing his turn in 'Boogie Nights' and showing his softer side to heartwrenching effect. But my two heroes in this movie are, inevitably, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Hoffman is rapidly becoming my favourite 'natural' actor of these last few years. His performance here is so subtle, yet so capturing. Just watch the phone conversation sequence, you'll see what I mean. It's true what they say too, this is Cruise's finest EVER performance. At first I considered his character to be a little simple. A sexist, arrogant creator of 'Seduce And Destroy', men's guide to 'trapping' women. However, what Anderson does best in this movie is unravels each character's past both gradually, and painfully. And Cruise's narcissistic character is no exception. I'll give you one line to look out for; "I'm quietly judging you." At that point, you'll realise that Cruise has used the barnstorming dialogue supplied to his character to it's absolute full effect.Overall then, from beginning to end this movie will touch you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you smile with glee, make you drool at the sheer talent that's on screen. But most of all, this movie will make you want to become a writer. Just so that you can write about people's lives with as much empathy as Anderson does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monument in Film Originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** A bold, solid, heart-wrenching film from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is loaded with gritty dialogue, strong language and some emotional moments. The characters, if you get involved with them throughout the course of the movie, will really prove that, "Hey, this is like real life." There's lonely LAPD Officer Jim Kurring, dying TV mogul Earl Partridge, Earl's trophy wife Linda Partridge, Earl's estranged, masculinity-motivational speaker/infomercial host Frank T.J. Mackey, Earl's heavenly home-care nurse Phil Parma, TV game show host/cancer victim Jimmy Gator(who molested his daughter 10 years ago), Jimmy's caring wife Rose Gator, their estranged daughter; a coke-addicted, high-strung woman named Claudia Wilson Gator, Quiz Kid Stanley Spector:who's forced to perform on the game show "What Do Kids Know?" so his father Rick, a failed actor, can keep? steal! his money, and 1968's former Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, a loser who's about to be fired from his appliance-salesman job at Solomon Solomon Electronics and who's yearning for the love of a braces-wearing, gay bartender named Brad against older bar patron Thurston Howell. So many characters, so little space to write.The movie starts off with coincidence oddities, then spins around the main characters' lives to the sound of Aimee Mann's "One." The movie goes on, where Jim meets Claudia and asks her for a date, where Linda drugs herself to near-death, where Phil calls Frank to reconcile with Earl, where Stanley wets his pants on the show and refuses to keep playing, where Jimmy has a stroke on the show, and where Donnie and Thurston battle word-wits over drinks at the bar. The way every character has to deal with their pasts is really touching and emotionally fragile.If you're reading this and you haven't seen "Magnolia" yet, this could be a SPOILER...but I digress...after the characters are pushed to their limits and nerve endings, the climax arises. It's the middle of the night/early morning on Magnolia Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley, California. The rain has cleared. As Jim Kurring drives down Magnolia after his failed date with Claudia, he U-turns after seeing Donnie Smith climb a telephone pole to steal money from his work. As he turns, a large green frog SLAMS on the windshield and another on the hood. Scared s***less, he looks up and around, only to find more and more frogs falling from the sky. Pretty soon all nine main characters are met with the frog rain. In this time, Rose Gator crashes her car, which happened to be near Claudia's apartment:where she seeks shelter; Jimmy Gator's suicide attempt is thwarted when a frog falls through the skylight and sets the gun off at the TV, causing a fire (assumed that Jimmy burns to death); Donnie Smith falls off the telephone pole, which causes him to fall and bust his teeth; and Earl Partridge finally dies, Frank at his side.So Now Then"Magnolia" is a great, great, great movie and sorely overlooked by the Oscar Academy. The film as I said is a monument in cinema creativity and originality because no other film has frogs falling from the sky, which is truly a grand moment in the film's climax. I hope that after you see this movie you feel the way I did--I left thinking about how screwed up my life is too, and maybe you can find an escape from what harm might come, like to the characters in "Magnolia." The best film of all time is what suits "Magnolia" the best. **** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caution may contain some spoilers. This movie is a prime example of a movie trying to get credit for being a masterpiece because of its acting. To be honest, the best part about this movie were the first three minutes, in which, were pretty original and quite humorous. Other than that, good acting doesn't create a story nor keep me entertained for three hours. Pulp fiction tried to do this same thing, and in my opinion failed just as bad. This movie lost whatever credibility it had developed by the end when it started to rain "you know what." After I saw this movie I was insulted that these writers and directors would think they could make me forget about a plot by pawning off good acting. I've got news for you; it takes more than acting to make a movie good now a days. And for all those who claim this movie is a masterpiece, ask yourself this; would you have still liked this "masterpiece" if it had been cast with first-time actors.Thank you, case closed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is possibly the best film of 2000! At first I was put off by the running time, but it goes by in a flash. The film starts with a series of 'coincidental' events, which is followed by a quick look at all the characters. Then the film starts properly, where we are plunged into 6 stories set across L.A in one day. First there is the story of TJ Mackey, a sex therepist who hasn't spoken to his father for 15 years. His father is on his deathbed, trying to find his son to say a few last words to him. His wife, (who at first married him for money) is realising that she now loves him, but is feeding him the morphine, that while kepping the pain low, is killing him quicker. There is a cop who starts going out with a coke addict, whose father is the host of a TV gameshow called what do kids know? On his show, there is a child genius who is being bullied into doing the show by his father, and there is the man who was a child genius on the show 30 years before. These all are connected, by the ending which brings L.A to a halt, and all the characters together. There is a central theme in this movie, and it is about how children can be ruined later on in life, by what their parents do to them as children. As a film, the acting is flawless, the camerawork superlative, and the writing better than anything else last year (except American Beauty). Well worth watching. Again, and again, and again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blooming of a Great Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Magnolia", Paul Thomas Anderson's third film is by far his most mature and most intimate film. After the out-of-nowhere success of "Boogie Nights", this is a well scripted, INCREDIBLY acted film about the relationships between fathers and sons, husbands and wives, men and women, stranger to stranger, and a society that tells us that none of them are important anymore.In an interview, Anderson once said that "Magnolia" was one of the first times that he just made himself sit down, and write, and when he wrote, he wrote without concern of boundaries or limitations. It serves the script well. The disjunct and highly kinetic film allows for the moments of clarity and stillness to be more acutely emphasized. The points that he makes are subtle, about family, television, religion, etc. But through their subtleness they are made very powerful.In the best ensemble cast in years, it is hard to pick the stand outs. Tom Cruise has gotten quite a bit of well-deserved attention for his role as a male infomercial guru. William H. Macy comes through again in another staggering character, something this has become par for the course. Jason Robard's portrayal of a dying man (fortuitous, considering it was his last film role) is breathtakingly piercing. But perhaps the most important role of all is the role of a hospice nurse, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. His scenes radiate with an intensity that lends absolute credence to the scenes that will play out later in the film (Watch how Anderson frames him in the background of scenes in which other people are playing, almost as a greek chorus, a technique also used by Anderson with Hoffman in "Boogie Nights").In the end, Anderson has succeeded in making a dramatic, touching, strange and wonderful film. His vision is clearly established on the screen, and without saying it, his point is made. Anderson is on the verge of becoming one of America's most important filmmakers, but, even if his career should fizzle out from this point on, he has managed to make at least one important film. "Magnolia" is a testament to what film can be, if only allowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close to overall perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly amazes me the more often I watch it. Seldomly have I discovered more unique camera and editing styles combined with classic suspense. Magnolia has a flow to it which makes the viewer really enter the movie and move and breathe in it. After three hours, a time which usually seems incredibly long for a movie, the viewer just screams: "How can this be over already? There´s still so much to tell!" From beginning to end the camera style underlines the story. As soon as we get deeper into the characters and their problems, we move to extreme close ups of their faces during monologues/dialogues, so close that, with every movement, the faces move out of sharpness. What in other movies might have been a technical mistake is here an element of a very unique filming style. Throughout Magnolia, there seldomly is a moment without music. Music, which always fits perfectly into the scene. And as the stories of the different characters begin to overlay and the suspense increases, we even hear two pieces of music and score at once. Anderson proves in Master-Hitchcock-style, that Suspense does not necessarily require shoot-outs and corpses. Simple human stories are thrilling enough, everything is a matter of putting it in scene. And as the thrilling storylines all gather together to one high-voltage peak, the story provides us with the most strange, surprising, maybe even disturbing plot-twists I´ve ever seen. Also outstanding are the acting abilities of the cast. Every role is as perfectly played as it is perfectly casted. I think I´ll have to stop writing now. Now that I´ve written so much about this masterpiece, I think I´m watching a certain video for the next three hours...</fullReview>

If only the sermonising had been edited out! All the lectures became very canting and moralistic over the 3 hours of this film. As one reviewer has already noted: Two people dying of cancer with two "I cheated on you" is way over the top. I also found it to be oddly man-hating and moralistic. All the men are evil. Although some of them do see the evil of their ways and are forgiven, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is not. "For what you did, you deserve to die alone."

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is one of those films that will hopefully be appreciated fully at some point in time, because now is certainly not good enough. Definitely the best film of 1999, "Magnolia" is just one of the best films ever made. It is everything that a movie can be and should be. It follows the rules and makes some of it's own, and it is just marvelous. Completely original, yet familiar at the same time, the story and plot could be found anywhere. It follows ordinary people, who live extraordinary lives without even knowing it. Which can be said of anyone. Life is so vast and strange that it is hard to see what is truly important. But "Magnolia" writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson seems to know. The stories all have something for everyone, something that is funny, sad, cool, enlightening, whatever it may be. As a film-maker, his style is also amazing. His pacing is perfect, taking a whopping three hours and making it feel like one. The movie flows beautifully and stays consistently entertaining. In some ways there are no words to describe how wonderful this movie is, it has to be experienced. Hopefully one day it can receive fully the attention it deserves, and become one of the defining films of the decade, if not ever. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had a lot of great acting and character development but I still did not enjoy it. For one thing it dragged on too long. Also the characters were not portrayed with any subtlety. The scenes where Julianne Moore screamed at the pharmacist and where Claudia yelled at her father to get out of her apartment were particularly bad. I had difficulty feeling Moore's love for her husband because she was constantly screaming obscenities at people. I have no problem at all with bad language but in this film, everyone used it, every other word. It got to be a bit silly actually, especially Moore's scene with the lawyer. I was overloaded by all the obnoxious behavior by all the characters, especially Tom Cruise's character (although Cruise did a great acting job).Also I lost track of a number of the plot lines. Who stole the drugs? Who killed the body in the closet? What happened to the rapping kid? At the end I didn't know and didn't care, I was just glad it was over.As for the frogs.. They didn't work for me at all. That was the last straw for me. The frogs seemed like too much of a contrivance. I groaned as soon as I realized they were a reference to Exodus.I stayed the full three hours because I thought "it would all make sense in the end", but it didn't..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unpredictable... Yes! Understandable... As clear as quantum physics.How could you not love a movie that has the greatest, most unpredictable scene of all time?The answer: Because this movie was a "long, drawn-out, plotless, no-direction-in-sight" movie.Why critics from newspapers, magazines, and TV glorify movies that really don't entertain the audience is beyond me!I was fortunate to view "Magnolia" in a crowded theatre. Practically everyone there had the same impression halfway through this film -- "Where is this movie going?" And when the credits started rolling up at the end of the last drawn-out scene, the audience was looking around to the other victims whispering in confusion, "Did I miss something?"The audience, then, broke out into a cheer -- praising that the movie was finally over. This is not an exaggeration by any means. At that point, I finally felt compensated that I wasn't the only one in that theatre that felt I just wasted these last three hours of my life.For viewers who love Tom Cruise, this movie will leave you having second thoughts about his morals and why he would choose such a sexist, foul-mouthed role."Magnolia" contains enough up-close-and-personal drug scenes that'll leave you scratching your nose. And enough foul language that makes Eddie Murphy's standup routines seem like a Sunday sermon.There are some redeeming qualities to this movie, but there's only a few. The opening story depicting urban legends was interesting; and of course, the misrepresented biblical reference was surprising. I couldn't help think of an old episode of 'WKRP in Cincinnati'.By all means, don't take younger viewers to this movie. I really believe it's a horrible outlook on life, and nobody should expose sponge-like brains to this mayhem. This movie is a total disappointment and leaves you wondering if you missed the plot. I guess the only intriguing aspect of this movie was I couldn't wait to get home and look up Exodus 8:2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying Frogs meet Boogie Nights with a Thud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia. Interesting name but somehow everyone we've talked to has never figured out what the name had to do with the movie. Paul T. Anderson did such an outstanding job with Boogie Nights but it appears he didn't want to use any new methods, pacing, editing, cinematography, etc on Magnolia. Majority of the same cast doesn't guarantee you anything. Each story was worth telling but not quite this way.We had high expectations and most of the Cast did an excellent job on an individual basis. Julianne went over the top as the pissed off, scared, exhausted, foul mouthed recently loving wife. Tom Cruise especially was great and stands out above all. The Male nurse was excellent in in empathy and desire to help and stay with his patient to the very end. John Reilly was very good too.People started to really lose interest when all characters in all situations &amp; conditions started to sing the same song. There was an audible sigh of relief in the crowd when the singing was over. The scene had a message but it went too far and lost most of us for totally lack of credibility.The rain of frogs was believable at first because this has really happened and the intro to the movie set you up for this kind of coincidental event. It just went too far, too wide and too long. Especially since there was only a rain storm early that night. No nearby tornado, hurricane, cyclone or other noted weather event could be tied to where all the frogs came from. Bizarre effect but like some of the acting, too much.Paul, Now P.T., Anderson needs to move on beyond the techniques in Boogie Nights. He has the talent to draw so much talent from his Cast and create multiple events in real time but this was too much in too little real time. Making the movie longer is not the answer either. After 2 hrs 45 minutes half of the audience that was left said- "That's it? We waited for this?" The other half said- "Thank God it's over!" We were just disappointed.In the case of Magnolia, more is not less. More was just more. I hope his next movie is not Boogie Nights meets the Game Show Flying Frogs at just under 3 hours. We won't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I respect Anderson's work. I do not, however, think it is genius. In fact, it seems more acutely to me...angst. In some cases it is well-developed angst in others it is tedious, drawn-out, unsubstantiated and unbelievable angst. I believe Anderson's strong suit is depicting suffering, but the characters are so bizarre and off the wall, I found it difficult to sympathize with them at all. I enjoyed Cruise's performance and Ramsey's performance. The film was too long and the ending left much to be desired. I imagine the frogs were Anderson's nod to Magical Realism. I wish he hadn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson has created a masterpiece that surpasses the field</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The method of the rapid cut/dialogue film has been used excessively since the early Tarintino successes. Magnolia is an example of that genre at its best. The method used is similar to mixing the sense of movement used in Three Kings with the messaging attempts of American Beauty, but here the product is not simply additive. Where American Beauty suggests, Magnolia boldly declares in some of the best writing that I have ever experienced, if not the best. The cuts are so well interwoven that every scene is fresh and inviting. Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise are breath taking, while the rest of the cast combines very enjoyable acting with the well supplied dialogue. Oscars are well deserved for Cruise and Moore, and are a must for Anderson's screenplay. Easily the best movie of the year, it makes my second choice, American Beauty, seem sophomoric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious and lazy all at once; definitely a step backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I can't say I either loved or hated Magnolia, I certainly appreciated it. The film occasionally transcended its mundane theme and thin characters, hitting its stride in a scene or two. However, Anderson, not displaying the wonderful directorial maturity he used to great result in BOOGIE NIGHTS, moves once too often to the gimmick bag, mostly notably at the climax, where obfuscation and imagery serve as poor substitutes for genuine substance.The reason? Magnolia is a lazy film, and a bit cowardly, as Anderson avoids the rigors of crafting a full story from start to finish, choosing instead to write six or so short films, stringing them together with a common theme. No matter what any critic may say, these stories do NOT intertwine in any significant manner...or at least, any more than ANY stories with similar themes do. Unfortunately, this theme, which bares an unfair burden in this film, is the fairly mundane, "We may be done with the past, but the past isn't done with us." Well...yes, okay, but stating a theme isn't enough. We need to FEEL the impact of that theme, and in Magnolia, that theme is repeated endlessly and diluted over several stories, none of which really hit home.The acting is uneven, with exciting turns (Cruise), subtle and classy performances (Riley, Hoffman), and then the not-so-good; the otherwise stellar Julianne Moore seems to be punching the "hysterical woman" button on her AutoAct device, and Jason Robards' overwrought deathbed scenes ought to be used in a PSA for euthanasia. Then again, these characters, like practically ALL the characters, seem to have nothing to them. It's as if Anderson wanted to keep practically everything of interest about these people in backstory, leaving us with people as scabs...nothing left to see here but the RESULTS of interesting things. Okay, but that's boring.What shocked me was the uneven writing! Anderson, who brilliantly kept all characters on the level in Boogie Nights, goes wildly over the top in Magnolia with an outrageously shitty father of a quiz kid. Similarly, in a shrill scene in which a daughter is confronted by her estranged and dying father, all we get is an endless repetition of "Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!" It's melodrama, and he's done better.However, Anderson does have a way of connecting scenes, even when they don't have anything to do with each other, and he's also got a natural style that favors moments and emotion over technical obsessions with focus and coverage. He's so stylish, he almost fooled me into thinking this movie worked. But after only a few minutes of reflection, it seemed pretty clear that it didn't.Magnolia is a good effort with some beautiful moments, but it's also an insecure film made by a writer/director who should rely less on tricks and contrivances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CRAP. C R A P. Ambitious, well-cast, CRAP. CRRRRRRAAAAAPPPP.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin?You get thirty characters--ALL ON THE BRINK OF SUICIDE. All of them are miserable. All of them are having THE VERY WORST DAY OF THEIR LIVES. All of them are varying degrees of reprehensible, and not ONE nice thing happens to ANY of them during the ENTIRE movie. It's all misery, misery, misery for three LONG LONG hours.Misery in itself is not a problem, but what Anderson does is jury-rig the entire movie and attempt to ratchet up its seeming importance by having every character on their last emotional nerve. Much of the misery rings EXTREMELY false--some of these characters are smart enough to do SOMETHING to leaven the unpleasantness of their everyday existences--but if they did we wouldn't be so "drawn in" and it might be a little more difficult or complex to bring them to the "redemption" the movie drops in our laps during the final reel. What it is is a massive COP-OUT. When you start a movie at the very bottom where the only way to go is up and keep the emotional level cranked up to eleven for the entire THREE HOURS it strikes me as an extremely MANIPULATIVE way to get an audience reaction without having to actually WRITE WELL or create SHADED characters with somewhere to GO. Guess what, PT? Life is NOT that bad! It may be for some people, it may be for a FEW characters, but creating characters this unrelievedly miserable is just a bare attempt to APPEAR to be plumbing the dark recesses of the human condition while playing in a rigged game. It renders the point of the entire film moot, undercuts whatever authorial integrity he might have established, leaves the audience feeling bamboozled, and makes Anderson look like a BIG FAT FAKE.The interrelatedness of most of the characters goes NOWHERE. There are some characters you don't even realize are related until you see their last names in the credits, and then when you try to think of what it might signify, it comes to absolutely nothing but another GIMMICK to make the writing seem expansive and wide-reaching.The huge plot contrivance about the frogs IS audacious, but again, pointless. Save it for a film where it might have some resonance. But at least it did spice up an otherwise bland and predictable trip down misery lane.It was the very SWEETNESS of the last half hour of BOOGIE NIGHTS that saved it from the very kind of manipulated misery that this film succumbs to. Life became a bit more bearable, illuminating how those characters made compromises and found a way to live with tragedy and make the most of it. And that was moving. But inventing characters who are all very falsely contrived to be on the very last strand of their sanity and then inviting us to be moved by their courage as they struggle to hold it together is just out and out manipulation. It's NOT GOOD WRITING. It's CHEATING.And if you are considering seeing this movie, just be warned. Or just... don't see it. I assure you you're life will be just as full (if not more so) without sitting through this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beneath all the 'c?ks----rs','s--tb?ls' and 'f?ks', there's tender love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is indeed quite a film, it has all the tears, joy, pain, suffering, compunction, regret, fear, and trouble, and pressure, dejection that a melodrama usually does and still does not lose its grip and become a superficial sob saga. It careens through every emotion above and even more, narrating the lives of many characters intertwining within 24 hours and causing twists in their lives and miracles in the weather. The film also uses a lot of close-ups and background music to support the emotions , the most defining song being the street rap sung by the kid which defines the entire film. And everything is said within three hours, keeping a religious reference in the picture too (the director-writer Paul Thomas Anderson, maker of the superb There will be Blood wasn't apparently aware when about the bible reference when he wrote the film). Magnolia can be a tour de force novel, and it's almost a miracle that has made it a great film, since people nowadays don't favor overload of emotions.Magnolia tells about many lives crossing paths in a single day, leading to newfound relations between them and a few tragedies too. Like Ebert said, there are too many stories to contain in a single review but the major ones are those of Cruise's, Melora's, and Flynn's. Cruise's Frank Mackey has a strained relationship with his father and now is a successful, cocky, arrogant sex adviser who gets grilled in an interview leading to certain events. Jason Robart's Earl is bedridden and shares his desires to meet his son. Julianne's Jane is a virulent and temperamental lady who actually behaves like that because of the guilt welling in her. Macy's Donnie is a gay man who was a child prodigy and had won a contest but now struggles to make a living. There are many others which I won't mention here but all of them go through changes and this tests their hardened exterior, making many break down and confess their sins, guilt, fears and sorrows. Everything moves like a game show, with an accelerated start, a slowdown with a breakdown, then getting back to an accelerated finish.The story is startlingly honest and endearing; if only George Scott could see beyond the profanity? Almost all the stories strike the right chord and it is only at certain moments the drama goes overboard, for example, Stanley breaking down on national TV. Personally, I felt that maybe if the Jim's story had been trimmer or if they had done away with or truncated either Donnie Smith's or Neil Flynn's story it would've had more impact but again, without these stories the film may be incomplete. But I do think the three hour and eight minute duration was quite long, and at times the message became convoluted since so many story lines were to be followed. But the more important thing was that these stories touched me in one way or the other and had a collaborative impact on me in the end, and after a day of watching the film, the impact of the film and my respect for Paul Tomas Anderson's vision deepened.All the actors support and never upstage the film, something that happens when great actors are cast. The music is terrific, and when everyone actually sings a song that's playing on the radio, I was reminded of the 'Fort Minor' music video, the group that sang that rap song whose name I don't recollect. The frog scene was in tune with the film since there have been such weird incidents, but fewer frogs, please. Mulholland Drive is similar to Magnolia except that the former is more surrealistic, but having seen both the films, I can say that Mulholland is more concise and made with a very clear and impactful, singular vision, while Magnolia is more swelling in its plot, with multiple themes and a more heartfelt ending. Out of the two, Mulholland is a better film but Magnolia is something that is more accessible to the audience in general. Thomas Anderson's approach here is similar to the great Leo Tolstoy's, both have many journeys running parallel each with their own redemption.Do not be put off by the run length mentioned behind the DVD case or the poster that looks gooey and maudlin or the amount of profanity in the film like George C Scott was or even the title 'Magnolia' that may seem weird or too artsy to some. Take your seat and experience this wonderful ride, you will surely not be disappointed.My Rating: 8.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Magnolia is a film that ponders the human condition like no other. It addresses universal themes like: coincidence/fate/kizmet, loneliness and isolation, regret, parental forgiveness, and our inevitable mortality.For the first time, we see Tom Cruise take advantage of the unctuous aspects of his own personality and utilize them in his impressive portrayal of Frank Mackey.While this film is quite long and challenging to watch at times, I've always found it to be ultimately uplifting.My mother was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I've decided to share this film with her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Work of P.T. Anderson: "Magnolia" (1999), a day in the life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a little difficult to make a summary of "Magnolia" because could be confused due to all the different names. Let's just say that it a compiled of strange stories with characters that are related from each other. Basically every character have something similar with another and the two main families of the film have the same problem: the father was a terrible person and now that is dying is feeling regret. And we can see the consequence of that in the sons and wives. The other characters are similar too: two good persons that are witness and are always helping the others (the police officer and the nurse) and the two "quiz kids" who suffers problems with their respective father too. And the rapper kid who is a very strange character, like a prophet. All are great and complex characters and you need to watch every story to understand the behavior of all the characters because of the great narrative style.Paul Thomas Anderson touches universal themes, like in most of his films, so for me all the characters are believable and you will feel them. I love specially one part of the film, the part of the quiz show, because on that sequence you feel worry about two persons that must hide their feelings just for an stupid TV show and how in that specific moment to know that you have terminal cancer and to need to urinate are problems with the same magnitude because two persons are really suffering, each for they problem.The situations in the film are really strange with all those "coindidences", just as the three stories at the beginning, but the situation with the rain of frogs is just amazingly bizarre . I love how that scene looks, because it was a downpour and it's sounds amazing. The rain of frogs can be related to the Bible but as the narrator said: "that strange things happen all the time. And so it goes, and so it goes". I think he is right because after all the world must go on. And i say that because after the rain of frogs everybody go on with their lives in a normal way.The cast is just superb, from the great and touching performance of Julian Moore to the very little but amazing performance of Alfred Molina. Well everybody did a terrific work just as memorable as the day of their characters. The music is another terrific aspect of the film mostly composed by Aimee Mann. I really love how the film start with my favourite song of the film "One", it's perfect just as the memorable scene with "Wise Up", a really powerful song.Conclusion: i love this film. It's long (188 minutes) but it goes very fast and in the humble opinion of this writer you must watch this film more than 2 times. When i watch it for the first time i really enjoy it but it was until the second view that i stop and think about every character's day and how is really memorable for everyone. It's "a day in the life" that nobody will forget and not just for the rain of frogs."Magnolia" is a film that i'm not going to forget and is my favourite of the great Paul Thomas Anderson. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Biblical Plague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was enjoying Magnolia right up to the part where a biblical type of plague came down upon all the characters in the film and I was then wondering what it was all about.Magnolia is an episodic, along the lines of director/writer Paul T. Anderson's previous success, Boogie Nights. A whole bunch of people, tied to each other by a successful long running quiz show have a lot of life altering events happen to them within 24 hours. The problem was that in Boogie Nights you followed a community of people from the pornography industry over a period of years. In Magnolia this all happens over 24 hours, more like Crash, although I think Crash was better handled.Some parts are better than the whole. Several characters for me really stood out.Tom Cruise took a daring career move in playing a motivational speaker for hedonism and male supremacy. How he arrived at this particular doctrine he preaches and makes money off is his story. His hedonism is covering up a very deep hurt from childhood.I liked William H. Macy as a has been celebrity made by that quiz show as a child. He's come to the end of his rope being able to cash in on that celebrity. Now he's a forty something gay man, mooning over a young and humpy bartender at his local watering hole and thinking he could nail the guy with a little cosmetic improvement on his part.Magnolia was the last theatrical film of Jason Robards, Jr. who plays the producer of the quiz show, Kids Know Best. The idea was to match whiz kid type geniuses against grownups in some sort of academic bowl situation. It actually sounded like a good idea for a real quiz show, I'm surprised no one thought of it in real life. Robards is dying of cancer and he's made a mess of his life as well as his sons's. Their reunion is painful to say the least.But of all the performances in the film by the grownups, I liked young Jeremy Blackman as one of the current kids on the show. He's being pushed by a stage father, Stanley Spector, who's living vicariously through his kid.All these good performances and others just somehow don't come together in the way Boogie Nights or Crash does. And the ending with the plague of frogs descending on Los Angeles was really too much and unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since Magnolia was released, audiences everywhere have been divided by those who love it, and those who hate it. Some think it's pretentious and pointless, while others find it to be cinema genius. I'm someone who love's Magnolia.Magnolia is an epic mosaic set in California's San Fernando Valley. We follow the various stories of various conflicted characters, and how they will all connect by the end of the day. There's Jimmy Gator, a successful T.V. show host for the game show "What Do Kids Know?", and has recently found out that he is terminally ill with cancer. His daughter, Claudia Wilson Gator, is troubled, and is falling deeper and deeper into a cocaine addiction. Then there's Earl Partridge, a terminally ill, guilt driven man who would do anything to see his son, and to be forgiven in his final hour of life. His son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise in his finest performance), is a charismatic sex guru, who offers silly advice to struggling men. Earl's wife, Linda Partridge, has about the same amount of guilt as her husband, claiming to slept around with other men. But, of all the years of infidelity, she is finally starting to love her husband, just as he is reaching death. Jim Curring, a modest police officer, is a struggling man who just wants to love someone, and for someone to love him back. He soon immediately falls in love with Claudia. On the T.V. show, "What Do Kids Know", there's Stanley Spector, a boy who has to deal with the grueling mental pressure of being on the show, and his father's abuse. The old winner of the show, the now middle aged Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, is a struggling man who, like Jim, just wants to be loved. All of these characters and stories will soon connect by a bizarre and biblical event. In the end, Magnolia is film of raw emotion. It's about forgiveness, redemption, humanity, morality, death, loss... The film deals with things that happen every day, and things that happen rarely. The film is also beautifully crafted by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, who has proved to be one of the finest filmmakers of his generation. Along with his brilliant screenplay and direction, Magnolia also features one of the best ensembles I've ever seen in any film. Magnolia gives thought provoking themes, and tons of powerful scenes, including when all of the characters sing Aimee Mann's "Wise Up". "We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."Rating: **** / ****</fullReview>

There are so many layers to this movie, but it never becomes bogged down by them. Writer/Director P.T Anderson gracefully weaves together five or so deeply complex stories that weave in and out of each other, all dealing with a the same basic themes: the sins of fathers being passed on to their children, love, tragedy, pain, hate, and ultimately, forgiveness. Anderson isn't afraid to take risks in his films and he takes plenty of them here, but they all pay off big time. This is a great movie. I loved it.</fullReview>

I hate watching depressing stuff like that. There were a few good and heartfelt moments in there, but basically I think this movie just encouraged us to wallow in how sh!tty everything is, and that's not what I want to spend time doing. There were redeeming features, but overall it was a pain to sit through, and way too full of swearing, too. I mean, I know miserable people swear a lot, because life is damn ugly to them, but I thought they went over the top here.5 out of 10. (This movie's presence on the IMDb Top-250 is an abomination!

However, "Magnolia" was such a huge disappointment that it doesn't give viewers much faith. I'm embarrassed to say that I've seen "Magnolia."To its credit, "Magnolia" had a few bright spots including the performances of everyone from John C. Reilly to William H. Macy. These performances were trampled by the number of story lines this movie has.The biggest negative in "Magnolia" was the multitude and number of confusing story lines. This will cause the audience to just not care anymore about the rest of the movie. I can tell you that this is exactly what happened with me. I think it would have been much better if it had fewer story lines."Magnolia" is the type of movie that would turn anyone off to the actors and director of the film from watching anything they star or direct in again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film - I had heard good things from people whose opinions I trust; I had seen and enjoyed Boogie Nights; I thought that the cast list was extremely promising; and I tend to go for darker films.However, Magnolia just didn't do it for me. Yes, the acting - for the most part - is top drawer if a little OTT in places, but you would expect that from the actors/actresses involved.The sweeping nature of the cinematography is also impressive, though there's nothing in there that I haven't seen before from a number of other directors (Altman and Scorsese spring to mind) in a number of other films. Some things really did not work at all - in my opinion, the scene when all the characters are singing the same song as the camera pays a visit to all of them is particularly jarring.Parts of the film were undoubtedly moving/amusing/depressing/inventive, but ultimately the film didn't really have anything new to say, and what it did try to say did not really necessitate the three-hour duration.This is not to say that I would advise someone not to watch it, just that I would warn them that they might feel a little short-changed at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot say any more eloquently that some of the other reviewers how bad this film was in every way. Yes, it makes me feel as though the critics raving about P.T. Anderson are paid off: how can anyone see this as anything but awful? "Boogie Nights," "Punch Drunk Love," and now "Magnolia:" this is the third movie of his I've suffered through, and it will most likely be the last. Bad script, bad direction, annoying use of music (!) - was he trying to drown out the dialogue (?), bad perfomances, but I attribute that to the script and the direction. Where is the value in a morass of foul-mouthed, depressed characters wallowing in their horrible lives? I don't get it, but if this is the future of film, I'm going to avoid this medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've seen a large number of comments stating that this movie requires a lot of intelligence to enjoy. I've also noticed that approximately 80% of the reviewers here enjoyed it.We can determine from these statistics that about 80% of the world's movie watchers are very intelligent people.Well, I consider myself fairly intelligent. However, I guess 80% of the world's movie watchers are more intelligent than me, because this movie made me sick to my stomach.Yes, the actors acted; they acted well. The intro was great, I saw a lot of potential. But by the time I heard the words "One is the loneliest number" for the 250th time, I was ready to press the mute button on the remote. Does anyone know how many times she sings that ONE LINE in that song? It's ridiculous. My ears still hurt.As for the movie, well, it never got itself together. There isn't a lot more I can say about it.It appears to be one of those "love it" or "hate it" movies. If you are willing to risk wasting 3 hours of your life, go right ahead and watch this. There's a chance you'll be disgusted, and turn it off after a few minutes. There's a chance you'll enjoy it. But remember, to enjoy it you have to be a super-genius, at least according to some of the other reviewers here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with all this existential crap?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no ingenious and life-changing philosophy behind Magnolia. Actually most of the stories had a dry prosaism that altogether COULD have been shortened. [Magnolia: The never-ending movie?]The director's a kid, barely out of his 20s, with an ego probably rivaling Spielberg. He extracts what little wisdom there is out of those 20 someodd years, and tells ME about what I should get out of life? A topic too large for a kid, that in effect is only some generalized concept to have no regrets and talk to your old man before he crusts over on his deathbed.The actors [Tom Cruise, ever the opportunist] were involved because P.T. had some leverage and momentary status after Boogie Nights [notice how he's on vacation from the face of the Earth in 2001] and thought it'd be pretty cutting edge to have characters that swear a lot. [There's nothing wrong with the F-word, but notice how irritatingly repetitious it becomes as the hours drag....the english language is vast and could have been used with much more color regarding insults than just breathing out f--- every other second.]The movies gestating our society today were made by directors who knew a few people rather than being chosen out of raw talent. Back in the day movies were actually ABOUT something. Movies used to have plot. Today the high culture bracket like Ebert and his kind get some rise out of the wandering cancer/suicide/loneliness set-up, as over used as it is.Sure, go ahead and do the intersecting-story thing, it's the fad nowadays. But it was done much better with Go -- which was funny, interesting, had much less severely pathetic characters, and although not a classic it at least didn't have that "wing-it" script quality. It was much tighter and vastly more clever. Magnolia is nothing more than an arrogant high schooler's perception into adult life. [The IQ factor must be low in 2001 for Magnolia to get 8.1 on the IMDb tracker.] People today just eat this s--- up.Because that's basically all it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The actors in Magnolia bypass playing characters entirely, instead ending up as overly familiar, two-dimensional character types - overbearing chauvinist, plucky child genius, perpetually addled speed freak, and so on. Writer/director PT Anderson, who balanced satire and pathos so well in the mostly good (and undeniably entertaining) Boogie Nights, here vastly overreaches his abilities: in attempting to present characters at the edge of desperation, he instead gives us caricatures of adults that could have been written by an over-eager adolescent. Every prominent woman in the film is hysterical; every man is either unbelievably overbearing or cartoonishly pathetic; nearly every epiphany necessarily follows a steady barrage of alcohol or drugs.Anderson squanders the promise of the movie's brilliant, enigmatic opening sequence, as well as the sizeable talents of generally excellent actors such as William H. Macy, with an "auteurism" as heavy-handed as that of Welles, without any trace of the latter's genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most arrogantly bad film I've seen this year -- Paul Thomas Anderson cannot write a decent line, reduces his characters to nothing more than hysterical or moronic cyphers, and -- apart from a knicker-wetting desire to be Robert Altman, cannot direct. Standout questions: The film revolves around a children's quiz show going out live. What quiz shows since the 1950's have gone out live? Why don't they, after 30 years on the air and dealing with kids, know what to do when someone needs to go to the toilet? Julianne Moore's character, in one of her more unusual speeches (she doesn't say "f***" for more than five words at a time) declares that she loves her husband. How does this manifest itself? Apart from saying goodbye to him in her first scene, she never relates to him in any way whatsoever (great "character development", by the way: She wears a fur coat to show she's rich, but swears to show she's "common" -- geddit? This, as long as I'm being parenthetical, rates up there with the Quiz master when we first meet him: During a breathless voiceover listing his family-value credentials, we get to see him humping a young woman who is not his wife, with jaded look on his face. Geddit? Anderson seems to scream. This is character development at its most 101). How brain damaged is the cop not to notice his date is coked out of her head? What happens about the gunshots fired at him that caused him to drop his gun? We saw someone pick the gun up and run inside a house, but later on (Spoiler alert, here:) It drops from the sky. Heh? When the genius kid breaks into the library: No alarm system? Isn't anyone looking for him? The film is riddled with inconsistencies like these, all wrapped up in a self-conscious, indulgent style that drags on for far too long. Anderson doesn't even know how to use music on the soundtrack, either drowning out the dialogue (and I LIKE Aimee Mann!) or cramming every scene with intrusive music, continually promising a crescendo that never arrives....until, about 3/4 of the way through, it just stops. As if he'd used up his entire music budget. Over on a "bad movie" sight, they list a couple of criteria for "bad movies" -- Ebert's "Stupid Movie" (when the action can only progress -- such as the kids wetting himself -- when people act like idiots) and "IITS", or:"It's In The Script!". This fulfills both criteria, and then blazes a path of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tries ever so hard to be a great movie, so I really think it's a shame that it turned out to be so fundementally flawed. The problem is that miracles (or even miraculous coincidences) should never (or at least rarely) be in movies. A movie is a construction, therefore can be manipulated in any way the moviemaker chooses for religious, secular, monetary, or artistic goals (I prefer the latter). As such, any miracle is simply a contrivance and of no use in any kind of didactic sense (do you really think any intelligent people were convinced to change their beliefs because of Stigmata, Left Behind, The Ten Commandments, or even The Virgin Spring? or South Park, The Exorcist, Love and Death, or any other "sacriligious" movie with satiric miracles? Either way, it's preaching to the choir). Emotionally--well, there are people who fall for everything from television psychics (if they're so psychic, why don't they call you?) to tele-evangelists ("Praise Jesus for the suckers born every minute!"), so why shouldn't it make them feel good that God will forgive or that there are other people who are disillusioned enough by religious hypocrisy to make fun of it by having God pelt those same sinners with frogs.Simply put, miracles are lazy writing, and movies are not the proper venue for preaching for (or against) religion through these supernatural forces.Think about it. If you favor the Christian side: how do you know that the first three examples of coincidences aren't just some urban legends, exaggerations of real events, or something Anderson just made up (obviously the ending is bogus)? Doesn't that undermine the miraculous forgiveness aspect of the ending, to know that everything leading up to it is a construction instead of a "miracle"? But on the other hand, if you favor the secular side, if you take the opening vignettes as satirically as they are presented, then the ending is being heavy-handedly satirical--leaving God as the ultimate prankster, sparing those who to us don't deserve it by pelting them with one of the seven plagues he unleashed on Egypt. If that is the case, then it is merely silly and amateurish humor without purpose or real meaning (i.e. it doesn't do anything to prove that God is malicious or whether he exists or not, it merely angers Christians).Either way, it undermines what might have been good in the middle two+ hours (not a whole lot, really, so it doesn't really matter).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a monumental waste of time. I feel much dumber for having viewed it. All I could think, walking out of the theater was, "I want those three hours of my life back." Tom Cruise was uncharacteristically horrible in his role, and the only likeable character was the nurse, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The only part of this movie worth watching is the first 5 or so minutes, which deals with the interesting coincidences in life, such as the man who jumps off a building to kill himself and, as his passes his own window, is accidentally shot by his mother, who is firing a gun that he loaded. This is the only part of the movie that is at all intellectually stimulating. Alas, though it is an excellent set-up for what might have been a great film, there is no follow through, and no connection in the actual movie to the concept set up at the beginning. Don't waste your time on this steaming pile of bad acting and bad writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I'll tell you how. Magnolia is one of those films that people seem to confuse with being "good" simply because it's long, full of false emotion and drama, and is chock full of big words (women seem to love this kind of movie, not surprisingly). To say that sitting through Magnolia is painful is an understatement. Picture a movie where every scene contains:1. Actors giving overly dramatic near-monologues.2. Repeated use of the f-word to make the dialogue seem more tense and dramatic. Now imagine that the f-word is used so much that you can TELL that the dialogue is scripted (note that this doesn't happen in GOOD movies).3. Tension so thick you could cut it with a knife; every scene seems like it's leading to some sweeping conclusion.Now imagine that the scenes change about twice a minute FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS. It quickly becomes unbearable, literally. This movie is just plain depressing for NO REASON WHATSOEVER. I really wish people knew what makes a movie GOOD; a good movie has soul, gives you insight. Magnolia does neither... it simply force-feeds the audience emotion in the hopes of provoking a strong reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to subtlety?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a very interesting film laced with great performances. Unfortunately, it is also laced with overly embellished emotional scenes in which the characters directly tell the audience what the point of the scene rather than letting them figure it out on their own. Most scenes go about 2-3 minutes too long, with the final minutes immense overkill. Anderson has some good ideas but apparently he thinks little of the audience's intelligence and feels compelled to hammer every point home. The two infamous controversial scenes are great examples--overkill. We can easily understand the points about synchronicity and unpredictable interconnectedness without them. Though I enjoyed the film and was highly involved and even moved by many scenes, this film would have been much more effective with about 40 minutes edited out in a way that would preserve some subtlety. I felt like the director was standing behind me smacking me with a frying pan every 5 minutes and saying "Do you get it? Huh? Do you get it?" Well, yes, Mr. Anderson I got it a long time ago and don't need you to spoonfeed everything to me, thank you very much! Still well worth watching. I give it a 7 out of 10 overall. Too bad, it could have and should have been a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mad, magnificent masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this review with a set-up of how high my expectations were for this movie. I was 15 when I first saw There Will Be Blood (my first PT Anderson film) and I can safely say it completely sandblasted my brain. It was so big and bold and brilliant, I instantly bought every other PT Anderson film and watched them all. First Hard Eight, which I found a little disappointing, but it was his debut and I saw his distinctive styles bubbling and maturing beneath it's surface. Then Boogie Nights, a beautiful, humane piece, and then Punch-Drunk Love - less ambitious than the others, but so wonderful in it's own little world. By this time, I had begun to understand that PT Anderson was something special - a true trailblazer in modern cinema, and one who always pushed himself and brought something new to the table as oppose to rehashing the same movie again and again. But nothing, nothing, could have prepared me for Magnolia. It held me like no other film ever had done, digging into my heart and clinging on for a three-hour ride through a world of true pain, of true emotion and, occasionally, such shockingly true and raw beauty it practically opens the gates for what cinema can be. It is unlike anything else I have ever seen, and yet so much like things that everyone has felt. It is a true living breathing work of art, a stunning blend of ballsy absurdism and painfully real human drama that truly knit together into something new, rich and utterly fantastic. An array of fantastic characters and their bizarre, richly tragic lives intertwine and reflect one another in a typically wonderful Anderson script, and his distinctive directorial eye is as graceful, probing and delightfully obsessed with long-takes as always. Please see this film. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People all to often watch a film and then want to analyse its every nuance.This is not always good for several reasons - it spoils your enjoyment of the film, the director often didn't intend there to be hidden meanings, and most notably, when you pass these thought trains on, you yourself become analysed and are frequently found more wanting than the film your criticising.I have read many many of the reviews of this film, and like many I have a personal opinion. However, unlike many others I will point out that these opinions are mine, they are what I believe and should form no reflection on what you may end up thinking.However, I am forever hopeful that they will make you watch this movie, because I believe it's a masterpiece. If it makes ten people watch it, then I will grateful if just one of them agrees with me and if watching it leaves them with the same astonished feeling it leaves me with then that was worth it.This film interlaces a number of stories on the pretext that many, if not all things, are cause an effects of other completely unrelated things that eventually bind them together.The actors here are giving career best performances. Tom Cruise (certainly not one of my favourite actors) gives a completely believable performance that by its end leaves a lump in your throat.The performance of Jason Robards as the dying man is accurate to say the least and his performance should have been an award winner. Perhaps made even more ironic by the fact that he did just 18 months later die of the same thing he portrayed in the film.Philip Seymore Hoffman is a great actor and in this he is at the top of his form, and that is a fine recommendation as one can give.William H Macy excels as a man with love to give, but with nowhere for it to reside.John C Reilly gives his all as a lonely cop who above all is a decent a person as you could wish to meet, and you will for something good to finally happen to him.Julianne Moore is the Prozac engulfed wife of the dying man close to the ragged edge, and finally, Melora Walters as the drugged up messed up daughter, who nearly falls off the edge of the world but may yet be saved.This is by no means a definitive list of the great performances of this film, because everyone in it performs superbly.The story line is impossible to list in a short brief such as this, and certainly would give away far to much. But these entwined stories all form separate parts of a whole, that gel together at the end in a way that few other films can muster.Oh, and the soundtrack, it's wonderful. Its placement throughout the film is pin perfect, and the singing of the track near the end totally shouldn't work, but it does so brilliantly.I once showed this to some friends and as it finished they looked at me and said "what the hell was that about?" and that sums up peoples reactions. People don't seem to think it was OK or not bad. They either think it was a confusion of over the top egotistical clap trap or a work of true genius. I obviously form one of the much smaller latter group.So watch it, I cannot guarantee you'll love it, and the risk is you may feel you've wasted three hours, but for a small portion of you you'll believe that it was three hours that were incredibly well spent.In a time when many films are simply re-hashes of older movies with a new glint of computer generated effects, this stands as an epic of story telling and one that I feel privileged to have seen.Thanks for reading</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface a simple story about chance and coincidence, however, Magnolia is a complex, character driven mosaic of intertwining lives on a single day in Los Angeles. The film remains human to the core, in that it tackles very complex, real emotions and themes such as forgiveness, hope, love and redemption and in this sense it is richly detailed. The only problem for me is that Paul Thomas Anderson overloads the film with hidden symbolism and biblical referencing which threatens to overshadow the human drama. Also the film is far too long, this is so Anderson has plenty of time to display a series of montages over music which can be a bit to showy and pretentious at times and some of the scenes are far too long as his camera swoons in Scorsese-esquire tracking shots. This aside the film is otherwise expertly handled and lusciously filmed. Although the film would have benefited from shaving off an hour, it remains a unique and interesting drama, that is excellently acted by a top notch cast (the one exception being Julianne Moore who's character really annoyed me and she over-acted to the max!).7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd say Magnolia is good for about five minutes of its runtime ? five out of 188, you do the math.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am stunned, but not in the way I thought I would be having seen Magnolia. I do not think I have ever come away from a film feeling more frustrated, more confused, more bored, more puzzled than I have coming away from Magnolia. When I say puzzled, it's not that I was confused by the plot for Magnolia it's because I like to think that whatever artistic or creative approach a certain director is taking to the material, I will be able to watch it, understand it and appreciate it ? maybe this film was beyond me, maybe it needs multiple viewings, maybe I saw it with the incorrect mindset; I don't know.But sitting down to watch Magnolia is like sitting down next to a window and just watching what goes on outside, whatever it is that happens: it can be lots of things, it can be nothing at all; either way, your patients will wear thin after a while and you will just get the feeling that you can be doing something else with your time. I have to admit, I did something that I hadn't done before during this film: an hour until the end, I switched it off; yes, I actually turned off the film. When I think back to the films I have been tempted to do so during, Son of the Mask; Thunderbirds and Miami Vice spring to mind but I sat trough those until their horrible endings ? but why not Magnolia? well, it just outstays its welcome; it outstays its welcome with its repetition of dialogue; its infuriating script and its dodgy narrative revolving around, well, a handful of people in Los Angles ? but it could really be anywhere. If you've sat through Linda (Moore) pulling some sad faces and shedding the odd melodramatic tear once, you don't need to do it again; if you've watched Frank (Cruise) go on a personal ego trip once, you don't need to see it for a tenth time; if you've seen Jim (Reilly) talk some nonsense to an apartment tenant once, you don't need to see him leave; stop; think and then go back in order to speak to the same character all over again about absolutely nothing at all.You get the picture: it would be boring for me to list every single character, the actor/actress that plays them and what happens to them that made me almost cry with displeasure and pain but that's exactly what the film does. Clocking in at three hours, Magnolia is a film that sits you down at the proverbial window and feeds you dribs and drabs of some of the most uninteresting characters put to screen. What does it all mean? What does it all lead to? Why does it all have to happen? These are questions I do not know the answers to since I submitted to this cinematic torture with an hour to go but I get the feeling, judging on its aesthetical approach, the film does not even answer them. I left a police man cowering in a garden under fire, a former quiz kid bent over a toilet feeling sick, a sex therapist perhaps realising what a jerk he is and a poor boy being subjected to his own kind of torture when he is put through the ultimate humiliation of wetting himself because he wasn't allowed a bathroom break. I actually asked myself why I was watching this; why it was being presented to me and where it was going to lead to: you know what? I didn't care, I simply did not care.On a flip side of film-making, films with big casts can often lead to more praise than the film deserves. So it has Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, John Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina ? so what? If you want acting then go to and see a play. Simply, a great cast had made a terrible film. Tom Cruise almost plays himself as he sits in a chair, flicking his hair and twitching facial expressions answering questions on his company. Don't get me started on the company: an idea that men take back what they are owed from women in the form of easy sex and false emotion; disgusting ? Yes, the message is treat women like trash because men are scared of going through a period without sex.But the film fails on other levels. It has a tendency to have music playing throughout most scenes, muffling what it is the characters are saying and I'm not just taking about the scene in which a police man asks the tenant to turn the music down. But then again, whatever people say in the film doesn't even matter; I have had more exciting conversations with my cat, I have heard people say more interesting things in foreign countries in languages I cannot even understand. Yes, Magnolia is bad; it is shocking in its lack of anything interesting happening, shocking in its failure to develop characters beyond second gear and mind numbing in its dialogue. Like Michael Bowen's character in the film; you will scream at the screen for someone to do something, anything ? you will grow irritable with yourself and those around you after seeing the film, you will sit in your chair after having seen the film ? head in hands ? wondering what you just sat through, maybe in shock but it is all for the wrong reasons. A quick question: what did Bowen's character stand to gain if his son DID suddenly snap out of it and resume playing? I don't know; I don't even know if the film does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frustrating mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's possible to make a film without a script, and someone should've tried with this pretentious mess. Much has been written about the performances (mostly very good), the music (excellent) and several of the vignettes and story lines of this film (some good, some very good and most silly), but the thing that hold's it together, Paul Thomas Anderson's script -- does not, in fact, hold it together. Sprawling and lacking in any coherent unity, the film wants to be an epic, but even epics have an economy of words and characters established and contained by one grand theme. Successful epics have a storyline or backdrop of universal conflict that multiple scenarios can be played out over. The scenarios played out here just seem like exercises in ego and sophomoric displays of metaphor. Mr. Anderson is not without his skills. The casting is sharp and the acting overall very captivating. Much of the cinematography is lovely and the tone, though uneven, often underlines the melancholy lives of most of its characters in an effective way.But too many times the script takes us on left turns not justified by any conceivable interpretation of a believable plot: be it realistic or fantastic. Despite the fact that the film starts out with a series of voice-over vignettes meant to establish the themes of the film, the "rules" of this film never gel and PT Anderson is left to wallow in ever more high-handed manipulations of the characters' emotions and the audience's attention span. One of the most frustrating aspects of the film, perversely, is the way Ms. Mann's music is used. In several places, the music is used somewhat in the foreground so we can follow along with the well-written ballads. But Anderson can't decide whether he wants the scenes to follow the music or vice versa. Sometimes the dialogue weaves in and out ineptly and sometimes, as in the climax, the dialogue is over the music -- thus serving neither and ruining at least the music.I really wanted to enjoy this and, indeed, there's much that I did enjoy: Julianne Moore's and Tom Cruise (of all people's) performances, Aimee Mann's music, to name a few. But after being patient for the movie to finally connect, after slavishly giving it every chance to gel and resonate, the last third of the film spun into even more chaos and pretension. I left feeling angry at the writer for letting down the director. In this case, that they are one and the same, points entirely to a case of inflated ego run amok.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the countless movies that I have seen, out of all the classics and out of all the legendary Academy Award winning films, 'Magnolia' is by far superior to all of them. Moreso in the sense that the movie takes some risks and breaks a concrete wall in doing so. While having almost no similarity to your modern typical Hollywood flick, 'Magnolia' reaches beyond its predecessors and grabs hold of uniqueness that our eyes just weren't ready for.While many find 'Magnolia' to be a little too much, or just plain confusing, that's what really captured my attention. It's the plain subject matter and colliding sets of subplots that I found so daring and interesting. The constant reference to Exodus 8:2 is a reoccurring theme throughout the movie and as one becomes more aware of it, the more they begin to find the movie less confusing.'Magnolia' tells the story of nine different people who are coincidentally all connected. It deals with chance, hope, luck, and how the past and future may affect our present. The focus is on children and their parents, which is blatantly showed on a more trivial scene where a child (the Prophet figure) is on a kids show called "What do Kids Know." The movie's incredible colliding collage of stories works well to prepare the audience for the inevitable: everything is a reflection of something else. We all have a mirror image inside us, and no matter what we do there is a constant parallel to that action.Though the movie takes place in one day, the set of juxtaposed story lines help to explore the characters deeply. We see the young (Stanley, Dixon, and perhaps Claudia and Frank) sharing a common theme of having self-actualization, while the older (Linda, Donnie, Jim, Phil, Earl, and Rick) show independence and a unique quality to present themselves as superior.I first saw 'Magnolia' about a year and a half ago. I think my first impression was that this is definitely not a movie for anyone, but those who enjoy a good deep intellectual screenplay will fall in love. The more I explored the themes and analyzed the movie, the more I saw myself in it, and the more I was influenced. PT Anderson delivers what I call a 'Quentin'. His first movie 'Boogie Nights' was a cult movie that not only raised some eyebrows but made a somewhat typical genre into a masterpiece. Then the unexpected happened and PT Anderson wrote a screenplay for yet another movie which would knock the socks off critics' feet.It's a shame Hollywood and modern America doesn't recognize such creativity and originality. 'Magnolia' forces us to open up our minds and think about what we are watching, instead of constantly being fed mindless eye-candy. We all want something new and 'Magnolia' reaches to that maximum point... and goes further.I am not a person who normally forces people to watch something I'd particularly like, but 'Magnolia' is a movie that everyone should see. It's THE movie of all movies, and it manipulates our thoughts about the world and the way in which we think. I always try to encourage my friends to see this beautiful, flawless piece of art, and although many have been reluctant to see it, my guess is that the movie is just too good for them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good and very bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the reviews on Magnolia is great fun. Views are divided between those who hail it as a masterpiece and those who call it crap and man'o'man are they angry or not.The funniest comment is made by Daff-4 a guy from Melbourne: If you are a dumb person and yet fancy that you are intelligent, you will love this film.Well, ha-ha, I would like to take a stance in-between the extremes.Magnolia is based on Altman's Shortcuts which is a far better movie in which the different stories are more skilfully interwoven. Magnolia fails miserably in many respects. At worst it is pretentious (some heavy lines sink like stones) or even ridiculous. The Monty Pythonesque frog-rain may be the silliest idea ever put into practice in the history of cinema and the beginning and ending scenes of strange coincidences are just misplaced.All that is good with Magnolia comes from the acting and that it is refreshingly free from clichés (excluding a few bad lines). Given a great script, preferably not written by himself, Anderson may some day even come up with a masterpiece. He must also understand that madcap ideas aren't always ingenious.So, yes if you like good acting and don't care that much about a great plot Magnolia may entertain you though it is best to watch it with quite a few breaks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most overrated movie I have seen in 10 years. It has no story, compelling characters or climax (worth mentioning). I can't imagine why anyone would give this movie the praise that it has received. I suggest saving your money and watch plants grow or paint dry instead. I subscribe to the theory that you can't fool all people all the time. I think a lot of people were afraid that they may have missed something that wasn't there when they saw this movie in the theaters. You can rest assured that they did not. People were probably worried that there was some "deeper meaning" that they missed and went on to praise it to compensate for what they thought was a lack of understanding on their part. It seems that there are times when something truly awful is dressed up as "artsy". Unfortunately, Magnolia is one of those times.</fullReview>

Now, I don't have much of a gripe with Mr T.Cruise, it's just he's often in dull films. That to one side, this film had potential - It's very well filmed, well acted and must of taken some organising, and it pulls you in just long enough for you to realise that - the plot's as thick as toilet paper, it's all a bit grim and Christ, it goes on for days.When the washing up starts to become appealing, there is definitely something wrong. Avoiding this film will lead to a sense of accomplishment, and clean dishes.O, there is one saving grace, a cute sound track: Save Me by Aimee Mann.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Engaging Film *Spoiler Warning*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of my current viewing of late has been of movies with a 3 hours length but none of them went as quickly as 'Magnolia". Though finding sympathy for any of these characters would be a very hard job, I found myself caring about what happened to them. Most of the reviews i've read so far for this movie pass off Tom Cruise as getting reward because he tried something different, what's the problem with that. I found his arrogant, self absorbed character engaging,and though he's not the most likeable character in movie history, he had me drawn in.Though unlike Short Cuts, the interwining isn't as obvious,sometimes it's very confusing.Tom Cruise &amp; Julianne Moore are a particular stand out from an amazing cast. Though one problem I do have is with the frogs falling from the sky tacked on ending. Julianne Moore's character seeing there is no way out from her guilt of marrying the dying Robards for his money and just realising it before his death,attempting suicide with the good old fashioned booze and pills. Tom Cruise's character facing his father (the afore mentioned Robards)on his death bed after years of ignoring him for walking out on his dying mother.There is so much happening withing this movie,some you'll care about,some you won't but I do urge you to see it. In years to come hopefully it will be appreciated.</fullReview>

What I should have done is turn the movie off straight afterwards. This was the most convoluted, confused series of stories I've ever seen. The characters were souless, the dialogue was dull and the music score was too loud. The movie was basically a remake of Grand Canyon, an equally awful film.If a friend recommends this to you, I suggest you re-evaluate your friendship. Its that bad.

Even her f-words sounded read off of a script.That said, these interconnects were completely unnecessary. A cheap imitation of Pulp Fiction at best, this film fails completely in its capacity to link these little plots.There are thousands of great ways to spend four bucks in three hours; this ain't one of 'em.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point a finger at society by creating a load of un-interesting, sleazy characters, then condemning them using a biblical quote. It doesn't sound great, and it's not. Magnolia is an awful, pretentious mess.Paul T. Anderson obviously wanted to show his skills as a director by trying to create as many characters as possible and building a story that would include all of them, and that's exactly what the movie looks like: a truckload of stories that barely have anything to do with each other, mixed together for the sake of impressing the audience. Apparently some were impressed, but I was not: there's not one single story that affects another, and the overall effect is that of a bunch of different plots randomly pasted on the same film.The characters of the stories are, again, a poor attempt at impressing the audience by using a trick, commonly known as "over-acting". There is the over-sleazy the TV showman, the over-macho, the over-hysteric woman, the over-stressed daughter of the TV showman. Only one character had my sympathy, John C. Reilly as the naive but compassionate policeman, but his presence eventually got lost into the misery circus.And why does the movie need to create so many morally corrupt and superficial people, when all it does then is showing that they won't change a bit? Why does Anderson want to show he is not ignorant by using a biblical event? This movie is so pretentious it makes me sick.3/10</fullReview>

The movie was almost totally perfect up until that point and it made a great thing somewhat less... great... There was no explanation whatsoever. I would have been alright with a pass by a television set with the news on explaining the event. But there was none! Another annoying thing is on the supplemental disc Paul Anderson was talking to an audience and said "This is definitely one of the top five screenplays ever." He wrote it.

Seems to me in an hour of a film something should happen when it's full of background music that suggests such a build up.The cast was great but their scenes were much too long and some were quite miscast. I was beginning to like Tom Cruise after seeing him in "Eyes Wide Shut" but, please, he was not at all convincing as his character in this one.Don't get me wrong. I am a film afficionado.

But you don't end up liking ANY of the characters, and you don't end up CARING about any of the characters. So their trivial problems (and their larger problems) become tedious and repetitious since you end up just wanting them all to go away. And not only is it boring, it's a LONG boring movie, droning ON and ON with more of the same.First, there needed to be fewer characters. And then, they needed to be interesting. SPOILER: The ending is wrapped up with this absurd, convoluted event in an attempt to show the author's wit and irreverence (it loosely relates to the opening sequence). But he comes off as a mere poseur, a pretender to the throne of "coolness" and uniqueness. I've seen the emperor's new clothes, and he's walking around buck naked, with nothing to show for his efforts except an all-star cast running around doing a lot of nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this starts out as one of those "there's a bunch of different stories going on, so I best pay attention so that I can understand when and why they later converge" movies... But an hour and a half into the movie (still only half-way through!) you start figuring out that the stories aren't going to collide (even though the first two scenes are teasers about coincidental stories crossing paths).Rats. I really wanted it to be a good movie. Some of the story lines were a bit compelling, but I left the theatre asking way too many questions. They could've easily left much more on the cutting room floor and still made the point of the movie (whatever it was!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I knew how to describe this movie. I don't want to say that it was truly awful, because maybe I missed something. It was three long, drawn out, boring hours. OK, Aimee Mann is a terrific musician, but why did I feel like I was watching a 3 hour Aimee Mann music video? I wish I knew what all the hype was about, this movie was DULL at best. The only highlight to the movie, and it was a true highlight, was Tom Cruise. He deserves the little gold man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia&gt;ShortCuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lived in the valley for years, and this is exactly, how it is. Rains frogs all the time(goggle if you doubt me). People compare this to Altmans "Shortcuts", but its a shallow association, that film takes place in LA, this is the San Fernando Valley, SFV, and if you don't know the difference, well then you just don't know...it would be like confusing China with Japan. Its a film about children and their parents, hatred and love, the connections we all share, and cant see because they happen on a scale too big to witness at once, it takes a widescreen view to appreciate them. Its about the amazing acts of chance and coincidence, and the completely improbable that really do happen, and unite us all, in and from our alienation. It features some of the best performances your likely to see in a movie, and some of the best dialog, like"I want someone I can share a comfortable silence with". Me too. And of course, "I love you. I love you, and I'm sick. I'll talk to you - I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow... for my teeth. I love you, Brad. Brad the bartender. You want to love me back? I'll be good to you. I'll be goddamn good for you. I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach you, and tell you.." But you could pick any character in this movie, and find, wonderful scenes, and dialog, every moment works. Every performance is fantastic. Even Tom Cruise is great, and how many times do you get to say that with a straight face. I have more affection for this, than it may deserve, and Im prepared to accept that. I loved it the first time I saw it, and have every time since. Its wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** contains NO spoilers *** nothing much to spoil here *** Perhaps I was not entirely fair to give this one the lowest score possible. For sure I've experienced film-attempts that were worse and even some kind of a torture to watch. Like "Wag the Dog" for instance, the first movie I actually walked out of (is that correct English?).Anyhew, perhaps I was simply too lethargic to leave Magnolia, after hours and hours and then still some more dragged-out minutes of so-called character development. And let me give some indication of what you may expect in that department by way of analogy. If you like "grass development," that is, if you're really fond of watching how grass is growing.. in real time. Well, then this must be a must-see for you. Small but really annoying Q that bugged me was: what if there's too much development for precious little character? If you look for character, try "Karakter" and give this one a pass.For me, the lawnmower couldn't arrive soon enough. The deus ex machina consisted of Kermit and friends falling from above. And speaking of Kermit, that reminded me of a show crowded by simple puppets with a lot more character than most of the humanoids in this flick.A 1/10, just in a vain attempt to bring down that ridiculously high overall score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>children and angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dark, sprawling, and visionary film that is Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia is not without its flaws, but only in the sense that no true masterpiece is "perfect." Conventional wisdom states that a movie must have a single protagonist engaged in a clear conflict. Magnolia may not be the first film to brush off this rule, but the subtlety with which it weaves its web of interactions between multiple protagonists is, as previous reviewers have pointed out, endlessly fascinating and complex. Of course, if that's all it is, it's just an intellectual game. But fortunately, Magnolia is much more than that.The real plague the film seems to shine light on is our capacity to lie to one another, and to ourselves. Most of the main characters, in one way or another, are dishonest. This doesn't make them "evil" - Magnolia has no real villains - but it does make them human. The purpose of the film's interlacing narrative is to show us the obvious in not-so-obvious ways, to reveal to us our shared humanity despite our differences, our flaws, and our lies, and to allow us to face up to ourselves more honestly in the process.Conversely, certain characters in the film tell the truth in very compelling ways, most notably the children: the street kid with his rap song, young Stanley, and quiz kid Donnie Smith (Stanley's "adult" alter-ego who, it seems, has in a sense never grown up).Often, the mark of a great film lies in its ability to triumph over the cynical without becoming sentimental, and Magnolia achieves this balance most directly in its central line, uttered by quiz kid Donnie Smith: "...and no, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels." The line at first would seem a throwaway, as Donnie drunkenly stumbles into the bar bathroom to vomit, but its weight is dead serious. The line contradicts the barroom cynic with whom Donnie has just been arguing, and is meant to reinforce the idea that a little faith in the better angels of our nature is not only harmless, but necessary, lest we all become empty shells of ourselves, like the cynic in the bar, and the versions of themselves that characters like T.J. Mackey risk becoming.The film makes Donnie's metaphorical line a literal reality through Stanley, who, when he finally rebels against his abuse during the final round of the quiz show, is juxtaposed with an image of the wings of the medicinal staff of Aesclepius on the TV set behind him, identifying him as an angel. The fact that the symbol is also a reference to cancer and healing connects Stanley's courageous act of speaking the truth with the shame of dishonesty and regret plaguing Jimmy Gator and Earl Partridge, the two cheating husbands dying of cancer, and by extension every other major character in the film."No, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels" is Donnie's (and the film's) plea to the viewer to look for innocence even in difficult places, and consequently, to invoke our forgiveness from out of the "confusion" of child and adult, young and old, innocent and corrupt, healthy and sick. The only real danger occurs when we separate ourselves by such categories and cut ourselves off from the whole, whatever each of us may make that out to be.</fullReview>

Robert Altman mastered this kind of mixing a bunch of stories and a bunch of characters all connected somehow way, way better in NASHVILLE and then in SHORT CUTS. i just wish that the frogs had landed on the set in real life so then all the cameras would have broken and then this movie wouldn't have been made in the first place. it's the epitome of a sophmore disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the main criticisms I've seen on this movie is it's length. I've sat through, and enjoyed, every minute of Shogun (8+ hours, I believe). Having said that, the length isn't what bothered me. It was the fact that I walked away from this movie with absolutely nothing. Now, I understand not all movies leave you a better and fuller person (see Naked Gun, etc.), but have some sort of entertainment value, nonetheless. This movie had neither the ability to keep me interested or awake. Like other reviewers, I simply wanted all characters dead within an hour.I've seen a lot of movies that require "thinking" (see Memento, Pi, etc.) and usually have the ability to understand, follow, and feel for the situations and characters. Perhaps this movie was just too complex for me. Maybe I should just stick to friggin' Disney films.If you want "art", go to a museum or library. If you want to broaden your horizons, pick up a book. If you have trouble falling asleep at night, pop this baby (or even Apocolypse Now) in your VHS/DVD player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starting off good, but losing it really fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Of: I saw the movie a few weeks before official box-office opening here in Austria. I have some strong emotions about this film: I hate it. It starts off really great. It promises to be something like Fight Club with some ill sense of humour. But it isn't. It is simple the life of a bunch of people (some brilliantly played though - congrats to Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise). No More - And no less. Some scenes seem to be dragged too long. I nearly fell asleep. All the time I hoped for something BIG happening. The movie could have been better if it was cut a little faster and I would have been perfectly happy. To put this right: I don't want this to be an action movie, I just wanted something to happen. I mean watching an old man die and watching his wife break apart can be told in 30 Minutes not 3 hours. Cinema is about having a good time. If I want to see (nearly) ordinary lives happening I would have visited some friends instead of going to the movies. SO: Don't watch this movie if you wanna be entertained.</fullReview>

Well, movies seem to be "very good" if there's nothingbeautiful in it, nothing uplifting, just a big mess of weird people and no sense whatsoever in the whole film. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I can only consider 7 Dollars a well-spent amount (or 3 hours) if there's anything to enjoy like beautiful music, a romance, something that educates or just entertains. The first 3 persons do nothing but using the F-word ALL THE TIME and if that deserves this film a 40th place in the top-250 than I would say there 's something wrong in present-day society. Do yourself a favour and avoid this product of a madman's brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lousy Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia started out as a very deep movie with different plots that were supposed to, as it is said in the trailer, "make sense in the end". Well it didn't make sense for the first hour or the second hour, but that was okay because the movie is three hours long and in the third and final hour, this will all supposedly make sense. At the end of the movie, I was shocked and disappointed. It didn't come together and make sense in the end at all. I felt foolish that I sat through this nonsense for 3 hours. There were so many questions waiting to be answered but never are. Examples: The plot with the boy genius suddenly ends. We don't know if the father changes his personality or not. The game show host plot is never resolved: The mother and daughter just cry together and no contact occurs between the family. The final scene is so inaudible by the soundtrack that you can't even hear what the cop is saying to the girl who is a "cokehead" but never confesses it to him because the film makers have already gotten the audiences money. So they end the movie by not giving any conclusions to the plots. It just ends. And when it started to rain frogs, I still had hope in this movie. I loved Boogie Nights and Hard Eight and I felt that the frogs would eventually have some symbolism in the movie....not so. It just rains frogs. Period. No meaning to the story. The movie tried to base itself on strange coincidences and encounters by showing an interesting 3 minute prologue regarding freak occurances that happened in the past century and how they all were somehow related. Too bad the movie really has nothing to do with coincidences and close occurances. That was a way to get you to see the movie. Don't be fooled! Awful stuff!</fullReview>

The result is a haphazard story that never goes anywhere. Some of the venues are annoyingly unrealistic (come on, a live game show?!?!) and the dialogue and situations are bizarre for the sake of it. [It was the same thing with "Boogie Nights."] I think he was influenced by Robert Altman's "Short Cuts." Altman brilliantly used interesting dialogue and personal interactions to make an intriguing/delightful movie about different lives coming together.

It's not because this movie was so powerful (in visual effect or plot) that it annoyed me, it's just because -every character- in the movie talked too much!! I wanted to slap them in the face and told them to shut up, start acting please! just a few example, Tom Cruise's character in the talk show and the interview kept repeating the same things - boring anyway, the dying man who lectured the nurse (indeed, he wanted to lecture us) for some regret thingie I'd probably known better (I actually yelled out - why don't you just die and spare me?! It's true), the cop, played by John Reilly, was even more talkative than my mom etc etc. no character in the movie I cared whether he/she lived or died, laughed or cried. When the frogs started falling from the sky, I muttered to myself: that's great, now it tried to make a turn into a comedy and made me laugh.At the beginning it showed totally seemingly unrelated events could be very intertwining indeed, but the next 3 hours failed to impress me in that way. One more thing, did critics rated this movie highly just because it dared to blur out the f word more than 200 times (I lost count at 214) loudly? It made me feel like I'd been living in the Disneyland all these years as I had never known so many people in real life overused that word and other dirty languages that much.Rate: 1 out of 10 (unfortunately there's no 0.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had some intriguing aspects, but on the whole, it sucked. I kept thinking it was over and then it just kept on going. I thought the running time was close to 260 minutes.........or at least it seemed that long. Julianne Moore is a joy to watch, and she was good. William H. Macy is a great actor and actually does his role justice in this movie, but the concept on the whole just turned me off. The Cruise character was absolutely ridiculous and I can't believe he agreed to do the role. The "preachy" feel and the blatant sermonizing irritated me. The metaphors and the allegorical qualities were not pertinent and frankly, I would rather watch reruns of Barney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Nashville to Magnolia - You can't get there from here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director attempts to duplicate the genius of Robert Altman's critically acclaimed movie, Nashville, this time with an edgier theme. The result is a confusing movie with a set of highly complex and non-interelated characters, who's life overlap in unrealistic and implausible ways.Altman's setting was Nashville in the mid-70s, and the 24 characters were masterfully woven. There lives converge and overlap gracefully and credibly, almost as if it was happening in real life. The director of Magnolia's characters were very angry and dissastisfied. The frog ending was over the top. It did nothing to add any realism to an already surreal movie. Maybe that was his intent??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is too long and too disjointed for the majority of filmgoers. In its first showing in our local theatre (in which I attended), half the audience walked out about an hour into the film. The local reviews were not honest about its content, length, vulgarity, and language. I heard only negative comments from the audience as we left the theatre, and many people were discouraged from attending the second showing. I personally rated the acting as superior, but the length and rambling of the film left me totally unappreciative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very difficult movie to watch. The distraction of jumping from scene to scene (especially in the first 2 hours) proved to be most irritating. It is almost as though, the director didn't want the audience to enjoy the movie. It had the feel of someone picking lengths of film off the floor and randomly splicing them together.There was a wonderful story as well as excellent acting... The sad truth is that the editing was just awful...I guess that this is an example of the current trend in movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films in the history of films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING!!!! May contain spoilers and this is not a POSITIVE review of the film!!!Exodus 8:2 But if you refuse to let them go ( the people ) behold I will plague all your country with frogs.Okay, so the film is heavy on the subliminal message side. So it has great reference in it to the Bible and comeuppance and an eye for an eye and retribution and all that Old Testament stuff. Here is my question. SO WHAT? How does that make a film good? Why is it that just because there is more than meets the eye to a film that all of a sudden brilliance is associated with it? Whatever happened to a finely tuned script? Whatever happened to actors that don't overact? And how about an editor? These are just several thoughts that trouble me about Magnolia. Films are an expression of ones thoughts and of their mind but please don't sit there and tell me that Magnolia is the best film of the year just because Exodus 8:2 pops up everywhere. That does not make it brilliant. What I will say positively about Magnolia is that there is a good idea behind the film. But the execution of it is terrible. This to me, and from what I have seen in the general public, is not a film that screams classic, it is more of an abomination. The first time I saw this film I was angry. I sat in the theater and waited for something to happen. I waited for the pace to pick up. I waited for the script to get better. But nothing happened. I saw it second time out of morbid curiosity. You know, to see if now because I knew all of the secrets of the film, that maybe I would enjoy it a bit better and understand it a little more. Well the definitive answer to that theory was a resounding NO. I still hated it, only now I could understand why I hated it. Before it was like an annoying throbbing pain in my head, the second time, I felt like Malcolm MacDowell's character did when he was forced to watch all those disgusting movies/images on screen in A Clockwork Orange.The worst thing about this film is the script. I have never seen the F-Word used so liberally and in places that it doesn't belong. And before you pidgeon-hole me and say that that is my problem right there, that I am opposed to profanity and "real" sounding dialogue, please bear in mind, I love Kevin Smith films, I loved Eddie Murphy's Delirious and I am not opposed to profanity as long as it has a place in the story and it makes sense. In here, it is overkill. There is one scene where Rose ( who is the cocained addicted daughter ) and her dad, Stanley, the gameshow host, are in the same room and her last few words to her dad are all F-words in some variation. Get the F out of here, F you, F you, F you, F you, F you, F you, what the F are you doing in my house, what the F do you want? etc. etc. The idea here is to show pain between the two. Well her screaming and swearing maybe once would have done it, but it is just overkill the way she carries on. People actually got up and left at this point in the film and this was what? maybe a half an hour into it?Then there is the Linda and Earl characters ( Julianne Moore and Jason Robards ). I'll get to Robards after but first let's have some fun with Moore. Next to Linda, she is the most overacted character in the film and perhaps one of the most overacted characters that I have ever seen. Bette Midler bugs me sometimes with her overacting but she is Hepburn compared to what Moore does in here. Her favourite way to show emotion ( and she is as stable as a MAC Truck hanging over the edge of a cliff ) is to use the F-word as well. I don't even think she knows how to talk calmly in the film. Every scene she is in she is either crying, screaming, swearing or shaking. There is one particular scene in the pharmacy when she explodes at the pharmicist that is so poorly done, so embarrasing that I actually wanted to cringe in my seat. There is no substance to her, no reason, no rhyme. She is just a very, very bad person and one that we can't care about.Then there is Donnie played by William H Macy. His character could have been completely eliminated and no one would have noticed. He is not necessary and I think he was in here simply so there could be some sort of gay theme in the film. And did you happen to see Tom Cruise's bulge in his underwear when he was undressing? It looked like he had boulders where his sack should have been ( hey someone had to say it ). Does P.T. Anderson have an obsession with the penis? Just a thought?Okay, now to Cruise. He was good in a bad film. But all that was put to waste in his last scene with his father as he cries and tells him not to F***in die, you son of a bitch. Enough said about that.Robards. He is a dying old man that is comatose most of the film. But then when he does wake up up long enough, what does he tell us? What great big secret does he tell us that is supposed to make us ooooh and aaaaaaaah? He cheated on his wife. Just like almost every other character, he cheated on his spouse. When this came out, I wanted to yell at the screen, BIG F****N DEAL!!! It was an old theme. There was no shock left now. After Stanley divulged that information and so did Linda and with Cruise's character being the way he was, it was just a nothing speech. But it was done with close ups as if he is cleansing his sould and awaiting a trip to heaven. What trash!! What utter trash.Magnolia is a film that has nothing to say, has some of the worst performances of the year and absolutely some of the worst directing and editing. Just because you have Exodus 8:2 in your film and that is what your great finale is all about, does not mean that you have a great film. This is without a doubt, one of the dumbest films I have ever seen. And I really mean that. The praise that is being heaped on it is completely unjust. I would tell you to stay away from this film but in some strange way I want people to see it. For two reasons. One to show you how bad it really is and two, to show you that no matter how talentless you are, if you get really lucky then you can still get a screenplay produced. P.T Anderson has a really bad screenplay here and it worked for him. See how wonderfully twisted Hollywood is?0 out of 10 In the trailer for the film, one of the final things you hear from the narrator is this " And somehow this will all make sense in the end." How I wish that were true.An awful, awful film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run from this wilted flower!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was everything I was praying it wouldn't be. After "Boogie Nights", I was hoping that Mr. Anderson would have learned a thing or two about pacing his films, selecting what really matters, discarding what is not central to the story and creating a more engrossing experience. He didn't. In fact, he got worse.Do not believe those who say this is a masterpiece. They are probably the same people who claim that "The Green Mile" is the best movie of the century. This is an unnecessarily overlong, not terribly imaginative, boring, sometimes-overacted, constantly self-indulgent movie by a director who believes his material is so but oh-so brilliant he cannot afford to cut any of it, when in truth he just needs to learn where and how much to cut, and how to cut A LOT.The story is framed by a fascinating introduction that promises something about chance, coincidence, destiny and the way in which lives intersect each other that never comes fully realized in the rest of the film. As it turns out, the individual stories seem unoriginal and repetitive, and some of them (as well as many individual moments) could have been avoided altogether without affecting the rest of the movie. Individually, the themes within each story have been done and overdone hundreds of times before. The director lacks the skill and subtlety to create parallels and analogies between the stories that do not undercut their originality. Watching "Magnolia" you have the feeling you are looking at something written with the slightest sense of imagination, with plots taken from bad movies of the week, such that the same story unspools over and over on the screen, going exactly where you figured it shouldn't go, and all to the tune of the most intrusive, "something wild's gonna happen" kind of music you ever heard.The overall experience is so torturous, so unnecessarily dragged out for the sake of it, that in the end you can't make yourself care about any of it. You see, Anderson seems to enjoy torturing his audience with long, static close-ups of his actors taking two minutes to change their expression as if to say -- "get in there and feel the intensity in real time!" Thanks but no, thanks.I started looking at my watch 45 minutes into this movie and went back to it at least 10 times before it ended. My suggestion: if three-hour movies tend to feel like three-hour movies to you, this one will seem endless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and it has a great cast, including Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilley and more. I really enjoy watching Magnolia, I think it's one of those movies that you have to watch multiple times to really fully understand what the director is trying to convey, but once you realize what it is it really is a great message. It is one of those movies, however, that I believe is really elevated by its great performances. I mean Tom Cruise in this movie is just amazing and not only him, but pretty much everyone in the film. I'm just saying Tom Cruise, wow. There are a few boring segments for me, as in these types of films where you have so many characters, you will always care more for some stories than for others. But it's a pretty good movie with a great script as well. Every character feels genuine, going through some personal struggle, which makes them feel human. The ending, you really have to take it with a grain of salt, but if you understand the message this movie has to offer, it kind of makes sense, kind of. Magnolia is an excellent movie and definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way, Way, Way too Long, and by the way, it is Way Too Long. Star-Studded Acting Marathon where Everyone is in Crisis and Cries a lot. They Shout a lot too. Especially Julianne Moore who is One of those A-Listers who is Miscast here. But the Worst Miscasting is Tom Cruise. No One, even those with a Maximum of Suspension of Disbelief will Ever Believe that Cruise can Cry with Conviction.It is an Irony that His Character and Spiel Bares a Similarity to a Self-Help Organization, Scientology, that Mr. Cruise has Helped Promote in Real Life. Anyway, the Movie Tries Very Hard to be Ironic, Like William Macy's Broken Teeth. All the Main Characters Break Down and Bawl Their Eyes Out and You may too After About 2 1/2 Hours of this Boring, but Good Looking Film. By the Time the Frogs do the Thing that they are known to do in Fortean Folklore, the Movie has Lost its Appeal. That Happens about the time a Kid Pees Himself (yes, yet another movie where peeing the pants is considered cutting edge).This is Recommended for Masochistic Film Lovers that get all Giddy when a 3 Hour Running Time is Announced. You know, it is a Return on Your Investment. More Movie for the Money. But be Advised, this is 3 Hours of Talk from Unappealing Characters Played by Big Name Stars who Embarrass Themselves at Times with Thespian Glee. The Best Actors in the World Could Not Sustain this Length of Soap Opera Emotionality. At Least in One Self-Contained, Self-Indulgent, Self-Destructing Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really have much doubt that this is a good movie. However, as many people regard this movie as one of the best movies of 1999, I'm not really sure what to think or say about it, specially with all the aggression that comes with criticizing an (possibly, I'm not sure) over-hyped movie (this is for sure not the best movie of 99 for me).The way the plot is conducted (and all of the interconnections between the characters, which is something the director establishes as one of the main points of the movie right in the beginning), the editing and acting are really superb, but I have 2 main complains about it. I really don't care much about Academy Awards, but the nomination for Tom Cruise is SO wrong. There is so much good acting in this movie, and they nominate Tom Cruise? Isn't that weird? (I'm not saying that he isn't good, he is actually very nice in this movie, but from all of the actors he is definitely the worst). Apart from that, the other thing that bothered me is that this movie takes itself too seriously, and this is a movie that shouldn't be doing that (I don't really think that ANY movie should do that). It takes itself as deep and meaningful, trying to be an 'artsy' movie, but it's actually somewhat shallow, not really overly complicated (as it clearly wanted to be), and I really think it relies a lot on hype for its fame (I have my reasons to believe that and they're all easily identifiable elements of the movie, but this is a spoiler-free review so figure it out yourself). This movie isn't half as deep as American Beauty, a movie that was released in the same year and in which you can really connect and be moved by the characters, so it baffles me how people think so high about Magnolia. Nevertheless, this is a very well executed (albeit shallow) movie and, despite the long running time, worth a watch. I'm not sure about seeing it again, though.Rating: 7,5/10 (I round ratings down)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PT Anderson's dark and stormy soap opera- or maybe it's just straight Opera-opera - with an ensemble cast of heartsick Master Thespians croaking to the cheap seats.(Cue Jon Lovitz: ACT-INGGG!!!) It gives Altmanesque a bad name and it's a unique mess of a movie. It's so excessive that I squirmed like a tadpole in my seat and couldn't make eye contact with the characters out of embarrassment. I've seen overbaked movies before but this one leapfrogs all of them.Julianne Moore, in particular, has a scene in a drugstore that was so terribly written and overacted that it's just torture to watch. I desperately wanted a hook to appear off the side of the screen and pull her to safety. Later Tom Cruise's slithery character has an awkward crying scene that was pretty embarrassing too, but at least he was able to cajole his way to an Oscar nomination.This is not, though, your run-of-the-mill failed movie from a good director or just a typical hambone actorfest. It cracks up so spectacularly at the end that it burns into your cortex forever. I won't give it away if you haven't seen it, ribbit, but it's a doozy. You may want to rent this to see just how loopy an amphibious.. er.. sorry.. ambitious filmmaker can get. But who knows? Maybe it will touch you deeply, change your life and all that, and I'm just some Netphlix toad with a heart two sizes too small. That's possible, but I cried at "Bridge to Teribithia", so I'm not made of stone.In any case it's cheese on a grand scale - High Gothic Velveeta - and I've never been able to look at a Paul Thomas Anderson movie the same way since.

		<shortDescription>Typical Overlong Overrated Hollywood Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this movie is rated in the top 250 on IMDb is beyond me. I will try to be fair and state the good things about this movie first. The cast is excellent with solid performances from the main characters (of which there are several as this is an ensemble piece). The plot is intriguing and original, but lets down after a solid narrative start.Unfortunately, these are the only good qualities found in the movie; the boring, mundane, and depressing aspects of this film far outweigh any interesting aspects. The Negative: (1) Overlong, clocking in at three hours (2) Unrealistic climax (3) The narrative at the beginning of the film seems to set up "coincidence" as the binding factor, yet the somewhat interrelated stories never merge. (4) Tom Cruise got an Academy Award nomination for this film? He turns in his typical cocky, arrogant performance. Anyone besides me notice he normally only stars in action films? His wooden performances in films like "Collateral" explain why he never headlines comedies or drams. (5) One of the most depressing films I have seen. The ending tries in some ways to wrap some of the story lines up in a more amiable fashion, but after 2 1/2 hours of grinding remorse, fails. In typical Hollywood fashion this film merited Academy nominations for the typical reasons: well-known ensemble cast; 3 hours long; and inter-woven story-lines.Better examples of inter-woven ensemble dramas not in the top 250? BIG CHILL, TRAFFIC, LOVE ACTUALLY, and BABEL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend recommended this movie to me saying it's great so I started watching it. After first 30 minutes of introduction I waited for something to happen that would connect all the characters and bring something new to the plot but nothing happened. After movie finished I felt disappointed and regretted three waisted hours. Movie tells about life decisions and their effect on us and people close to us, about human relationships, regret, past that haunts us, loneliness etc. The basic idea of the movie is good but realization of the idea is poor. Characters are unconvincing, dialogs boring and everything happens so slow that you don't feel anything - you just want movie to be over. I can't see a purpose of nurse talking with the operator for a few minutes, watching almost real-time game show and guru's show and a cop asking so many stupid questions. It's really annoying. In my opinion movie could last twice shorter and still manage to tell the story. I could talk and talk about this movie but it doesn't deserve this. My advice is not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is clear from the film as well as from the apocrypha surrounding it is that this is a very personal project of Paul Thomas Anderson. A broad cast of fine actors give him everything for all three acts over 3 hours... but whimsy gets the better of the film.For the first two acts there's rage and suspense. Then the experiments start - a noble thing in itself, but the movies are objects that can be appraised and reworked if they're not functioning and this has been left sprawling and untutored. The third act threatens twists and peculiar revelation, tie-ups and shock but only a portion of this is delivered. One cannot write this off within the subject of the film itself, i.e. 'odd things do happen'. I was also puzzled by his blanket obsession with Aimee Mann, whose songs compromised Jon Brion's interesting and interestingly used score.So, transfixing over the first two hours, a muscular, heated span of film-making that exposed the disappointment of the final third all the more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this film is so bad,but totally disagree with the opinion that it's a masterpiece. The plot of the film seems to be made for 3 different themes and accordingly, the author must have made 3 different films. These 3 themes aren't new themselves;the importance of belief in love and reliance,the difficulty of relationship between mentally growing child and parents,the inevitability of payment for guilt over beloved people. Director Anderson introduced an additional forth theme; "coincidence as Providence", but it functions only as a formal element without resonance with main 3 themes,because these themes are presented as personal problems of weak people,which can be and must be resolved by themselves.(it is a great difference between Anderson's film and "Stalker" by Tarkovsky, where main characters are humiliated and disappointed by human beings or civilization as a whole,clearly unhappy from the very first scenes).Namely, there is no justification of "deus ex machina"embodied by the rain of frogs. Presentation of "examples" of coincidences as framing episodes made the situation even worse.By them film became longer than it really needs, and more complex than it might have been,making the film even more inconsistent. Such formal "explanations" and "resolutions" for 3 hours fiction film I can't accept seriously.</fullReview>

The cast members all do really good jobs with their roles. I never could have predicted what ended up happening in the movie, and I now will forever wonder whether certain things do happen by chance. You will probably never think about anything the same way again after watching this movie. I'd never even heard of Philip Baker Hall before this movie, but now I recognize him often; prior to this movie, I'd probably seen him in something and just not recognized him. Paul Thomas Anderson certainly followed up "Boogie Nights" with something really good; "Punch-Drunk Love" was sort of confusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia was a film I had a strange relationship with. I first saw it at the cinema on a one day only screening and came away not knowing what I thought of it but pretending to love it so I could fit in. A few years later I watched it on TV and completely fell in love with a film that is undoubtedly a ''magnificently made masterpiece''(a quote from The News of the World). Each of the characters is endearing to the viewer and no one character comes away without having a story that was worth hearing. In particular Jason Robards, Jeremy Blackman and an extraordinary Tom Cruise in the role he was born to play. Anderson's screenplay is a collage of ideas and theories which tie together intricately and perfectly (a perfect example of a Best Original Screenplay). And despite some criticisms, the cast rendition of 'Wise Up' was perfect. If you don't cry during Frank's emotional breakdown in front of Earl or Donnie's admittance of love to Brad the bartender, then you've no soul.10/10 'I have so much love to give, I just don't know where to put it'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is forgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such an interesting film. P.T. Anderson focuses on the people who skim the edge of society in many respects. From Boogie Nights with the subject of pornographers to this tale of people who feel they don't quite fit right yet mask it well. I can understand this movie being difficult to watch because it is incredibly long and rather emotionally draining because all of these characters are so pathetic in one way or another. They all have failed in some respect and the failures still cling to them. Some more visibly then others. The thread that ran through all of the lives of these people was the phrase, "What do you forgive?" At the end of the day you pick and choose what you can forgive and you continue on.I suppose the film came out at a time when I was examining that very thing and it did mean a lot to me.John C. Reilly turns out one of the most delicate and personal performances. He always brings such a fragile presence to the screen and it shows so much in this film. It was such a fully formed character that had plenty of things hidden and yet revealed so much to the audience. His scenes with Melora Walters just broke me in two.All of these characters broke my heart so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ensemble piece of cinematic grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent work of film-making in our modern times. Despite a three hour running time that nearly dooms any movie in today's channel-flipping universe, the movie seems to be much shorter. All actors and actresses put in fine performances in a character-driven story of people's relations and lives. The casting of character actors (John C Reilly, William H Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, etc) is a perfect choice for such a moving drama. The feeling of regret, and how there are things in this world that one cannot take back or change, is a refreshing theme in such forgiving times. I highly recommend this movie to high-brow cinema types who love a good story with relevant characters. If you are looking for an action, light hearted, no brain, all filler, typical 150 million dollar budget movie, stay away. (this site is filled with such young, impatient minds) Put in time and effort into this movie and you will be rewarded. I give this movie a 9 of 10, or A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed and slow, but not without its moments and definitely interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When George C. Scott was approached for a part in this film and shown the script, he exclaimed "The language is terrible." I disagree. The language is real. The dialog is true-to-life. We don't, or, very rarely, at least, always say the right thing, and we often repeat ourselves and say stupid, pointless things when making a point or being in a situation we can't control. Contrary to what you might think, this doesn't mean that the dialog is tedious. It may take some getting used to, but you realize that it is much better than typical Hollywood dialog... because words don't convey our emotions the same way body-language and behavior does. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously knew that, and used it in this film. I haven't seen any of his other work, but I will. Now, this film is character-driven, and that is its biggest strength, and its main reason for failing in some parts. It's a long film, but it's not overlong(maybe a little in the end, but the first two hours are hardly ever boring). It's a film with non-Hollywood dialog, but this is just something to get used to. The problem lies undeniably in the character-driven nature of the film. Some big films have many, many characters. This one, however, has many, many main characters. This means that there are about 15 people that you have to remember, learn of, and follow throughout the three-hour run-time of this film. This means that you probably won't be able to pick up everything on the first viewing, and, more importantly, there will most likely be at least one character that you dislike, maybe even strongly. This makes every scene with them hard to sit through, and their very presence in the movie can make you annoyed with it. For me, it was Jim Kurring. He was just so pitifully annoying and unbearable. He can't tolerate 'bad language', he has the most annoying blind faith, and he just seems generally retarded. What's worse is his narration and his lack of charm or charisma. He's the guy you avoid in real life, but act nice around because you don't want him to know how badly you hate him. The film has some very heavy-handed symbolism and some seemingly pointless scenes, that could easily have been written out or cut with no real effect on the film. I enjoyed the first two thirds considerably more than the last. The scenes near the end... I won't put what happens here, but it just seemed pointless and stupid. The film didn't seem to have a real ending... nothing is really resolved. No questions answered, no solutions given. It's basically just a story about all of these people, and that's it. I don't know if I expected the ending of the film to hold some major surprise(well, that it did, I admit) or an explanation, but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end. "But it did happen." Yes, but why? Are we supposed to take some moral lesson out of all of this, or is it just a study of different persons and strange coincidences? What makes a magnificent drama, I think, is if it offers a commentary on something that we all know, or pushes through an important point... One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the beautiful message of freedom and fighting for it, Citizen Kane shows how important love is to any man... but what does this movie show? What message is it trying to convey? I can't seem to pin-point it. Maybe I need to think more about the film... maybe there is none. That doesn't make it a bad drama, but it prevents it from being a truly remarkable one, I think. The plot is very good and well-written. The pacing is good, at least for the first two hours... after that, it seemed to slide a little downwards. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. From the biggest star to the least seen extra... not one performance was unsatisfactory. Not even the child actors. The characters are well-written and credible. All in all, a very good drama, but not a perfect one and not as impressive as some shorter films. I recommend it to fans of dramas, but I will say that it takes some effort from the viewer to enjoy and it is kind of an acquired taste. It's also a bit slow, after the first two hours. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia ****/out of 4Magnolia is in my top 5 best films list. Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best modern directors-he's up there with Wes Anderson, Lars Von Trier, etc. After watching Magnolia, I thought one word...."PERFECTION." Everything about it is perfect. The acting is amazingly brilliant, the timing of all the events, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the colors, the symbols, the metaphors--EVERYTHING!Magnolia is one film that is metaphorically honest about life. Either you understand PT Anderson's stuff (especially Punch-Drunk Love and Magnolia) or you don't. Magnolia should've won Best Picture in 1999 (wasn't even nominated!!!) and everything else it didn't win. A great film, a classic, a masterpiece!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of these films I have to see again after a certain while. We see different lives and different problems and different things that happen. There are little moments that change the whole life of the person for this moment. It touches. Every time I saw that film I thought that I want to thank the director for this film. There are many stories that want to be heard, and its great you took this! I think magnolia is a film for people who want to think about living, forgiving, chances one can take. The music is well chosen too. The actors are wonderful. So what I really want to say is thank you all for this film! I would like to see more of such quality in cinema.

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film consists of several stories of people who's lives are loosely connected. They are all very compelling, well told, well acted, always original and a bit surreal at times. My only complaint is the lack of coherence I felt. The film starts by telling us that some things are just a coincidence, and more importantly, that some things aren't. But this idea that certain things are meant to be, doesn't really get through to the story. I was left wondering why they bothered with the intro, since all I saw was coincidences and the film did not make a strong effort to persuade me to think otherwise.But having said that, this is a great film. It's engaging, enjoyable, funny. It's not as good as "The Station Agent" or "Lost in Translation" but I guess anybody who likes one of these films will enjoy the other two as well. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the premise of the movie and the acting was generally above average. The various characters blended perfectly and held my interest throughout. My dispute with the reality of this movies is the language. Either Paul Anderson was deliberately attempting to offend the viewer with his use of the "F" word, or he was attempting to establish a new Guinness record with it's use. People don't talk like that. I've encountered a few around the world who did but even then it was tempered. I finally gave up on Anderson's credibility when the kids were using it during the game show. I'm sorry but even if Anderson talks like that, his grasp of reality was lost during the movie. Even though I personally liked the dilemmas of the characters and how they blended together, the excessive use of profanity is enough for me not to recommend this movie to anyone.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Cinema--Just Give Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life can seem like a very long trip through the labyrinth but there really is an overall plan. Magnolia brilliantly weaves the maze of personal dramas humans create for themselves--that endless slogging of expectation and disappointment. Then, at just the right moment, the movie borrows from the musical genre to allow the central characters to experience an epiphany. Striking just the right cord, the scene is dark yet hopeful. This leads to the climactic reminder that God is still in charge.Yes, Tom Cruise ripped me apart by revealing a depth of pain very few people can tap let alone express. However, the movie delivers its most poignant scene at the end. Melora Walters' character, Claudia, has spent an entire life numbing herself to those around her. During the final scene her suitor comes to deliver a message that is drowned out by the soundtrack. We strain to hear the words just as Claudia strains to let the words through. But alas, the words are not important--the message is important. Claudia receives it loud and clear. Brilliant cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually absorbing but pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I did find this movie visually appealing and the characters interesting, I found the overall movie pointless, and it definitely felt like three hours to me! The ending made no real sense to me, and while I saw the connection between all the plotlines and characters, it wasn't as highly coincidental as they made things out to be with the opening vignettes. I was very impressed with the way Tom Cruise played his character, and the cast all fell very well into their roles, but by the end of the movie I didn't really care what was going to happen to them. So many questions were left unanswered for me that when the movie was over I thought to myself "What was the point of that?" I know many cinema buffs will disagree with me completely, but for an average movie goer I think an entire afternoon or evening could be much better spent than watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, this film is a movie lover's feast. A feast full of rich a delectable tastes. Dig in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not for the faint of heart. I made the mistake of starting this movie at 10:30pm thinking that it'd be the usual 1.5 hour movie. I should have looked at the sleeve more closely, this movie is over 3 hours long. Not to mention the fact that Anderson pushes the boundaries of storytelling by interweaving a multitude of characters to tell one story, or message. This is a "thinking man's" movie and not something to just flip through like so many movies released today.The script is great, but Anderson has also put together a fantastic cast to bring it to life. John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Philip Baker Hall are some of the best character actors around and they just light up the screen. Tom Cruise who gives a stand out performance as Frank T.J. Mackey (host of an infomercial called "Seduce and Destroy"), Julianne Moore, William H. Macy round out the cast and bring a little star power along with them. But there are a ton of more actors in this ensemble piece, such as Jason Robards, but the list is simply too long to list.It's so hard to review this film, simply because it is told in such a unique way. All of the characters are connected to one another in some way shape and form and Anderson uses a variety of styles to tell the story. In fact, at one point, it's almost a music video as all of the major characters lip sync to one of the cuts from the soundtrack. This movie is funny, sad, poignant, and absurd. It's simply one of those films that you'll be talking about days after seeing it, still trying to put all the pieces together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what is more amazing, this movie or the bashing it receives. Frankly, anyone who bashes this movie because it does not connect all the story lines ought to watch it again all the way through and closely, otherwise you miss a subtle yet key connection. (No, I won't give it away, it was simple enough to figure out after the first viewing.) Secondly, for everyone that rips a movie because it does not have non-stop action needs to get a clue. Performance-driven movie is not a reference to a race car in the movie. If you want an exciting, popcorn film, and want to avoid dramatic movies with strong acting, the you damn well better know what you are going to see. And on another note, stop whining about the prices when you go to the concession stand at a given theater. If its too much, just don't pay for it, or maybe you should get a real job, or at least a real education to get you a real job. By the way, this movie featured amazing acting and if you have a reasonable attention span, and a desire to see quality acting, this is a good movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>complex film, some fine performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for a second time on Bravo and I forgot how great it was. This movie has been critisized for having too many characters and a rediculous ending, but in fact considering the movie is twice as long as most movies, it fits everything in nicely. This is a character film pure and simple, a chance for some really fine actors to show their chops. For the most part the performances are excellent, although some of them come close to vearing into overacting territory. Everyone talks about Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore but I felt their performances were too over the top for me. Watch for John C. Reilly and Melora Walters (Reilly must have studied "Cops" religiously because he nailed the condescending police officer rant perfectly), they shine in this movie, and their story is the one I kept rooting for, so nice that Walters' smile is the last thing you see in the movie. And what can be said about William H. Macy? Brilliant and understated as always, although he seems to be play the same character over and over again, he's like the Joe Pesci of pathetic losers, yes you've seen him in this role before, but he's so damn good at it, why not? The one story I didn't like was the Kid Show, that was a little over the top (no kid would be allowed to swear like that fat kid, especially since he didn't even answer any questions, what's so special about him) and the perfectionist uncaring father was just a little too predictable. But it all made up for it when the kid sees the frogs falling outside his window and says "this happens".Which brings me to the much maligned frogs. I must admit that when I first saw this in the theatre I thought it was hokey, but now I think it's pure genius. Contrary to popular belief, I don't think Anderson gave up on his story and just through it in there out of desperation for an ending to tie it all together. First of all, you don't write something so cleverly and expertly and then "give up" as people have suggested, secondly, it was Earl Partridges name as producer of the Kid's show that really ties everything together, the frogs is a reference to the beginning prologue stories about coincidental bizarre occurences. Strangely, these events told at the beginning actually DIDN'T happen, yet we believe them because they are presented as fact, yet the frogs falling from the sky was laughed by many people as silly and rediculous when in actual fact, there have been several documented cases of frogs, fish and other things falling from the sky. Scientist believe that storms and hurricanes suck them into the sky and deposit them miles away from their point of origin. The kid even says "this happens". The number of frogs was obviously exagerated (which I don't think was needed, even a few frogs would still have done the trick) but it is an effective way of shaking all the characters out of their little personal dramas the way only a good frog raining can do. :)I wasn't crazy about the scene where everyone starts singing the same song (which wasn't *that* great), it didn't really make sense and kind of ruins the frog raining scene because it essentially does the same thing, everyone becomes united through one event. It was almost as if he originally wrote the song singing scene as the uniting event and then decided the frog raining was more effective. Anyway, I didn't get it.In conclusion, and excellent film if you like strong performances and highly complex, intertwined story lines. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, from all that I have read, all the gripes and complaints against the movie had to deal with how long the film was. Yes, 3 hours is a long time for a film, but it's not that long if you have an attention span over an hour and a half, want to see the characters become developed, and see where the story goes. I didn't have much of a problem, even though the movie is a little slow for about twenty minutes in the middle, the rest just carries you along. Another thing i heard was how much the characters were disliked, partly for their childish attitudes and ethics. THEY WERE MEANT TO BE THIS WAY! Through out the entire movie, you are shown the lives of nine people each a different problem in their lives and how it affects their lives in each encounter and conversation. Personally i loved the film, the scenes that start the film kept you interested and intrigued about what the rest of the film will be like. So if you have a short attention span, stay away from films like this, go watch your quick-fix action films. If the rest of you want to be challenged and moved in a film, watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this film is supeb. I think that Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore get all the praise but the best performances in my opinion are William H Macy's troubled Quiz Kid Donnie, the ever-brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman's nurse Phil and especially John C Reily's lovelorn Officer Jim.Jim and Phil are in my opinion the best characters in the film because they are learning to deal with life instead of using sex, drugs or just shutting the problems out. Linda and Claudia both take too many drugs, Jimmy and Earl have both had shady pasts and now both have cancer, Frank and Donnie's pasts have both have an effect on them ones lost everything he once had while another is trying to get something out of life. Theres also something about parental relationships in here - Frank resents his father Earl because Earl left his mother and Frank had to look after her. Claudia was abused by Jimmy and now has turned to drugs. While Stanley obeys his father even though his father runs his life. Donnie's parents have also ruined his life by taking the money he won on the game show. Through the three hours of the film we get how this present shows us the past and hints at the future. Jimmy - We know he's abused Claudia (shady past) and he has cancer and by the end he's dead thanks to a gun and a frog. Earl - Another character with a shady past again dies from cancer. Linda - Seriously injured at the end of the film but given a chance for a new start without Earl. Claudia - Like Linda had a drug problem but is also given a chance for a fresh start. Jim - At the end we see him with Claudia as hes a character with no inherint faults he will probably end up with her. Phil - The character we know the less about he looks after Earl but we know nothing about his personal life. Stanley - Tells his father to be nicer to him and may take control in the household. Donny - Another person who may get a fresh start after he gets over his obsession with Brad the Bartender. Frank - Know that hes got over his past Frank may be able to enjoy his present. And he may be looking at trying to patch things up with Linda.This is one of the best films of the nineties because we look in depth at so many different characters. Things could be explained a bit more but I suggest you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly ambitious equals ambiguous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This highly anticipated second feature length film from the director of "Boogie Nights" ultimately fails, though it is a noble failure. It sets up the several situations which any filmlover might naturally expect to eventually become intertwined. While Mr. Anderson does try to accomplish this - indeed, the notion of fate and the intertwining of lives is the very theme of the film - he eventually fails to succeed. He may be in good company, as this technique was also used in the more recent "Traffic." But Mr. Anderson makes a fatal mistake in the realm of fiction: there is no clear protagonist. Or protagonists bound together, as in the 'buddy film'. Instead, we have a collection of short stories that are broken apart and interspersed. We therefore are given no real theme, just an attempt at one. The wonderful performances by virtually every actor are sadly wasted. It was a nice (though far too long) attempt, but ultimately leaves a great deal to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about the ending of ?Magnolia` before I saw the film. But then, when it arrived, I was shocked in spite of this. It strucked me suddenly and unexpectedly. It's actually a disgusting scene but there's no question that it fits perfectly into the huge, magic storm of sadness that rules the film.?Magnolia` catches. I think it catches everyone. Even someone who spots a few weaknesses, will be fascinated by the movie as a whole. Even someone who says that the acting performances were terrible (which is actually hard to imagine), will admit that he got caught by the stories and the way they are linked. The film runs three hours and pictures twenty-four hours and somehow you believe that exactly as much time went by, although you don't feel the movie was too long.I don't want to go into every detail of the direction or certain actors. That would be a pity because I think, if you look too close at the movie you'll find one or too flaws. Don't. Think about the rain scene and the one where they sing ?It's not going to stop`. ?Magnolia` is a wonder. An audivisual composition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Countless people have devoted countless words to dissecting this film. So instead of analyzing the specifics, an overall impression..."Magnolia" is various parts brilliant, depressing, fascinating, darkly hilarious, unfocused, and pretentious beyond belief. Sometimes, it's all of that at once. The film could stand some editing -- if you can't say it in less than 190 minutes, you ain't saying it right -- but despite its bloated running time, it's seldom boring.Watching "Magnolia," you get the sense that director P.T. Anderson realizes exactly how gifted he is. There's a point where such knowledge hurts more than it helps, and Anderson reaches that point several times. It's like some scenes exist just so he can scream, "Look how artistic I am!" That can be annoying, even if you agree with his assessment.Overall, though, if you have three hours to invest and don't mind, um, making certain leaps of faith, check out "Magnolia." Whatever else you might think, you can't deny that Anderson has his own unique vision. It might not be perfect, but it sure is interesting. And I'd rather follow a director who knows where he wants to go but occasionally gets lost than some doofus who never even bought a map.</fullReview>

Standouts in the cast include Phillip Baker Hall, Tom Cruise, the late Jason Robards and Julianne Moore but the acting cant compensate for stories that go on and on about nothing. The prime exampl is the cop and the drug addict woman...what was that all about? I dont mind sitting through a long movie as long as it pays off in the end but the last shot of the camera just watching the woman is stupid. Maybe im the stupid one, maybe this film has gone way past me or maybe its more of an art film, maybe its wrong not to like it cos of the critic praise. Can anyone tell me whos place William H Macy's character was stealing from?

		<fullReview>First off, I was pleasantly surprised by this director's Boogie Nights. I was equally disappointed by Magnolia. A rambling 3 hour movie that eventually goes nowhere. A large ensemble cast spearheaded by an excellent Tom Cruise performance, that ultimately is the only reason to watch. The plot development, or lack thereof, leads to its ultimate demise. The second half of the film goes into Woody Allen territory (ala Everybody Says I Love You) of Cecil B Demille locust analogies. Spare me! The characters are a bunch of losers who are pathetic, not sympathic. And the ending leaves so many loose ends that I expected to see a warning during the end credits that "MAGNOLIA will be back....in DAFFODIL". Rent Boogie Nights and see the potential of Magnolia! I give it a 2 for Cruise's performance. The movie's an 8 in the first 90 minutes. Shut it off then!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nineties Ultimate Pity Party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers Ahead.The "I feel your pain," generation reaches its climax with the over the top, 'Magnolia.'If Mel Brooks ever wants to make, 'Springtime for Hitler,' as a serious drama, he might want to hire on the writers, directors, and producers of 'Magnolia.' I heard so many positive things about this film that I virtually thought it bulletproof from criticism. In fact, halfway through this movie, I still thought I was watching something profound. That is, until the end didn't materialize.The misery and discomfort, which is treble midway through 'Magnolia,' offers no release, just more tension. Well, I shortly realized I was viewing a propaganda piece on how truly fragile we all are. Duh!Of course we are fragile. We are human beings. Tell me something I don't know. Every single character in this mess is a blubbering, self loathing victim. The viewer is deluged with the inadequate cop, misogynist guru, dying cad, alcohol addicted game show host, sexually abused and drug addicted daughter, etcetera, ad nauseum.To be sure, some fine acting exists in this movie. Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Philip Baker Hall, and Jeremy Blackman deliver stirring performances. Unfortunately, the material, as related above is tripe. And no, I didn't think the frog shower was clever.Despite its high rating and popularity, this film is unique in its time only. This is not "The Graduate," which has a timeless message at its core. Certainly, everyone will be able to connect with this film's message of despair and feeling of hopelessness. Normally these feelings are salved in private. Only the adolescents or those who don't wish to grow up, fly that flag of despair high in the air as their national banner. Makes me wanna cry, but I won't, at least not in front of you. I rate this pity party a three out of ten. Don't despair people, happiness is out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating film, unique story-telling approach, great ensemble cast, just misses its mark, I rate it 7 of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Keeping in mind that one person's "1" might be the next person's "10", my rating of 7 represents a compromise with the high and low points of this film, "Magnolia", whose title is still a mystery to me. And that is my first gripe - in a good film the title should be meaningful and obvious, once you have seen it. Now, having spent about 8 hours viewing (twice) and studying this film and the "extras" on the DVD, I am prepared to comment. (BTW - the 70-minute "making-of" extra is in many ways as interesting as the film, and gives a great insight into the writer/director.)CAUTION -- SPOILERS FOLLOW -- READ AT YOUR OWN RISK --The film's prologue, using 3 "historical" events serves to support the narrator's contention that strange things happen all the time, and they may not be a "matter of chance", not "just one of those things". The 1911 "random" killing of a store owner in London's "Greenberry Hill", by 3 men whose names were Green, Berry, and Hill. The 1983 "accidental" scooping up of a scuba diver by a fire-fighting plane, after the diver and the pilot had been in a gambling-related altercation two days earlier. The perfectly-timed "accidental" shooting in 1958 of the boy attempting suicide, shot by his mother as he fell past a window, after the boy had loaded the gun so the parents, who always bickered, could shoot themselves.The saying is introduced, "The book says, we may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us." Meaning, seemingly strange things, or strange "coincidences", may simply be our past having its way with us, to right the wrongs. And this concept is what ties into the final few scenes of the film. Is "the book" he refers to "The Bible"??Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William Macy, Artie Johnson, and several great but lesser-know actors play the parts. Robards is a wealthy TV producer, father of estranged son Cruise, and who is rapidly dying of cancer, and Moore is his young wife who married him for money, and cheated on him many times, but has now fallen in love with him and can't deal with his impending death. Macy is former Whiz Kid Donnie, a homosexual, who can't quite get his life and job priorities in order after his father spent all his winnings. The game-show host is also dying, has cheated on his wife, and when she was young had molested his now estranged daughter. The daughter sniffs coke and picks up men for casual sex, meets a good-guy cop who had been called to investigate because of noise and loud music. There is a modern-day whiz kid whose father "abuses" him simply by demanding that he know all the quiz show answers and "set the money-winning record."Each of the 8 or 10 stories are told in parallel over this one day in the L.A. area, and done so very well. All the characters end up being at least loosely connected, and the running "thread" is that today's problems have been caused by "sins of the father". As the film starts, most of the characters seem on the surface to be in control of their lives, but we quickly see that they in fact are all out of control, with the exception of the cop, who is a devout Christian, and the wife of the TV game show host. Both of them are good people who are even taken aback at hearing the use of swear words. At one point, each character, in turn, joins in singing the lyrics of a background song, "It's not going to stop until you wise up." Much like you would find in a musical production, like "A Chorus Line", on stage.Which brings me to my second big gripe with the film and its script. The use of the "F-word" is pervasive and, in my opinion, grossly overdone. I'm no prude, but just like too much "spice" will spoil great food, in this film too much "F-word" spice brings the script from extraordinary to just ordinary or worse. Watching the "making-of" special explains this - the author/director uses the same expletive in his normal conversation, but that is no excuse. We are to believe that these characters in L.A. speak like that, and maybe they do, but I usually assume a film is made for a broader audience. A good writer can still convey anger, grief, exasperation without simply reverting automatically to the "F-word" as his main vehicle.The film comes to its climax during a day when it was "raining cats and dogs", as more than one character comments. Later, it actually begins to rain frogs! Large bullfrogs! One review that I read references Exodus 8:2, regarding God inflicting a plague of frogs on Egypt. This may in fact be what the writer intended to reference, however I could not find it spelled out. However, the Exodus tie-in is not essential, because the prologue established that this film is about "strange things happening", and they are caused by some higher power, God for most of us. However, it does make sense, a plague of frogs sent as punishment.The frogs are not just for effect, one falls through a home skylight and deflects the gun at his head just before the TV host pulled the trigger, attempting to commit suicide. Another hits Donnie in the face as he is climbing a light pole (to reverse his theft of cash), causes him to fall and bust up his face. And, while frogs are falling near the cop, his gun, lost during the night, also falls from the sky!!The dying men come to terms with their sins, those who were messed up by them begin to rebuild their lives. The modern whiz kid tells his dad he has to start being nicer to him. The cop starts to help the abused daughter gain some self-esteem. In the totality of the film is a fulfillment of "the past isn't through with us" until the wrongs are righted!The way the movie is written and filmed makes it somewhat difficult to know how to take it. On the one hand it seems to be the simple theme of redemption from the sins of the father. However, take for instance the "What Do Kids Know" game show, pitting 3 adults against 3 kids. The questions are absurdly complex and difficult. "What is the original language of the following line, and if you can sing it you get bonus points." The young boy names it, and sings it, perfectly. I think it was intended to be way "over the top", an absurdity, a parody of game shows.Or, take the Cruise seminar "Seduce and Destroy". It is done in a combination of a revival style and that of a corporate sales training seminar. It is so radical in its style and message we instinctively know it would never fly in the real world. These kinds of parodies make me believe the writer/director means for the whole movie to be sort of absurd dark comedy, much like "Being John Malkovich" is, or "Dr. Strangelove" was.Also, the young black kid who we see a couple of times, delivers his message in "rap", but he is for the most part not comprehendible. I must assume his character was essential to the film, but we don't really know why, or what he is saying. Maybe he is supposed to be a modern "prophet", and he is the one who recovers the cop's lost gun, and who sees to it that it rains down with the frogs.In the writer's apparent concession that his script isn't easy to comprehend, has several monologues where main characters explain large chunks of past "sins", otherwise there would be large holes. The film, at slightly over 3 hours, runs a bit long. Some of the scenes where Robards is mumbling semi-conscious in his bed are well-done, but just seem to drag on way too long. In contrast to most of the film which is paced just right.It is unfortunate that the "extras" on the DVD do not include the "director's commentary" track as an option, or at least a short review "in his own words" about what he intended for this film. Perhaps part of his intention is for each of us to take away from it what we want to.Wow, this is the longest review I've ever written, but this is a very complex movie. I was thoroughly absorbed both times I viewed it. The pervasive foul language gave me some discomfort but did not obscure the message. It isn't for everyone, and I can certainly see how people can hate it, while others love it. I am glad I watched it, and am satisfied my "7" rating accurately represents where it fits among other films I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I enjoyed "Boogie Nights," and could see the similarities in the director's style in the way the camera would follow the actors around at close range, and in delightful unexpected little surprises (the sing-along). However, I think this movie is much darker overall than "Boogie Nights." It was hard at times to decide if it was a dark comedy or a drama, but I guess it was meant to be both. The characters were multi-dimensional and sympathetic, and did not necessarily turn out to be exactly what you'd expect. What was so interesting about this movie was how the characters' lives interrelated, and how each of the characters evolved. Tom Cruise surprised me: until seeing this movie I had never thought of him as a particularly gifted actor. The characters are believable and real, and are not "beautiful people," as most film characters seem to be. As for the movie's plotlessness, it didn't matter. It was about life, and life does not have a "plot." Just as in "Boogie Nights," I came to care deeply about each and every character.In reading these reviews, it became apparent that people either loved the frogs or hated them. I am one of those who LOVED them, though I am not entirely certain what it meant. Maybe it meant nothing at all, and maybe that was the whole point. "Sometimes things just happen." I don't think 3 1/2 hours was too long for this movie. I could have watched for an additional 3 1/2 hours.</fullReview>

The power of his films cannot be denied (Hard Eight being a stunning debut, Boogie Nights being another astounding, entertaining, beautiful-yet-still-hard-to-watch film), and Magnolia is no exception. This is an emotional, gut-wrenching character study of a group of people that are linked to one another and the trials and tribulations they suffer over a 24-hour period. The performances are astounding, especially Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. The story lines are all so real, yet skewed just a bit, and it's that touch that really makes the film, if you ask me. The climax, which is the only flaw in the film, just didn't make sense to me. It didn't seem out of place, however, it just seemed a bit...weird.

At the Beginning of the film there is a little story about Chance or Coincidence and i really fail to see how this ties in to the film. Ok , some of the stories to entwine with each other but i fail to see what this has to do with chance. Never the less , this is a truely unique film that you will enjoy. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-shot film covering several topics which tend to make people cry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As E.T. was formulated to send children through the emotions, Magnolia is Cry-ence Fiction for adults. This wonderfully shot, beautifully scored and well-directed film weaves together several stories which tackle the question "What makes people cry?" (and its precursor, "What fills theaters and makes people feel clever at Oscar(R) time?" Magnolia covers all the bases -- terminal illness, lost childhood, regrets over missed opportunity -- without ever moving in to score back at home plate.Speaking of scoring, the two real stars here are Tom Cruise (figuratively) and Aimee Mann (musically). Mr. Cruise turns in some of his best acting to date and Ms. Mann has never sounded better (I still have a soft spot for her vocals on Rush's "Time Stand Still").If you're a fan of manipulative tear-jerkers, this one's for you. If you want to think you're smarter than you are (bet you loved Rushmore), this might be for you. If neither of these matter and you have a strong stomach for self-indulgence (Note: more useful to empty your mind than open it), then you will certainly enjoy the visual design, performances, cinematography, and soundtrack.</fullReview>

I can't believe I wasted over 3 hours and the $ to rent it on this over-hyped, self-indulgent, self-satisfied, pseudointellectual garbage. I know that people who did enjoy this (and the thought that they share the roadways with me and vote in elections absolutely scares me) will dismiss any criticism as being "unenlightened" or "pedestrian".

		<fullReview>Magnolia is one of the most critically acclaimed movies in recent cinema and it's easy to see why. The director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film before Magnolia (Boogie Nights) was also praised by the critics, The cast is unmissable and it's storyline is not far from the one told in the critically beloved film Short Cuts. A storyline that in fact consists of multiple lives and destinies that intertwine with each other in a way that in the very end has designed a mosaic of different people. Magnolia tries hard to beat Robert Altman's Short cuts but fails, mainly because of three things.1. A terrific cast doesn't mean flawless acting. The usually good Julianne Moore, William H Macy and John C Reilly are all extremely uninteresting and their performances are dead boring.2. The script. Paul Thomas Anderson is a good director but his scripts lacks interest and they're always filled with an amount of mannered scenes that feels unnecessary.3. The overlength. I don't have any problem with long movies as long as they are interesting throughout. The Green mile for example was great. However magnolia turns from interesting character-study to yawny moan-fest as a dying father wants to get in touch with his long-lost son which makes the movie so unnecessary long that your interests in the characters starts to fade. And apart from Short Cuts the different stories does'nt interweave as good as they did in that movie.If some of the characters had been performed and described better and if Anderson had tried to make the film around for example two hours instead of well over three, this could have been a great film. As it is, Magnolia is a definite disappointment.Still it's far from crap because there are things here that is definently worth seeing. Jason Robards and Tom Cruise as foul-mouthed father and son respectively are both charismatic, so is Melora Walters as a young heroine-addict. The music is also good, supplied by Aimee Mann and Anderson's wife Fiona Apple. Mann's terrific song Save me was Oscar-nominated along with the screenplay and Tom Cruise's performance. So Magnolia is definently a film that is worth to watch. If not for the already mentioned reasons, then watch it for that extra-ordinary rain-scene in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can save Tom Cruise and throw away the rest: it's as simple as that. Now the world is full of directors who want to be Robert Altman, but nothing like "Magnolia" can show how much the author of "Short Cuts" and "Nashville" is unique. I saw other films as long as Magnolia (like "Casino" or "Heat") but this is another story; only Americans can bear heavy bricks like this or Stephen King books. Where do they get free time? Have they found the secret of 48-hour days? It's the only possible answer, otherwise nobody has enough time to spend watching the same boring and 2D characters (good cops, horny husbands, addicts, cruel TV hosts) talking, weeping, talking, swearing, talking, weeping, singing (everybody sings! what an American bad idea!), weeping again and talking till death finally arrives. In this unbearable context, the noisy coming of the frogs has the useful function to wake up the poor viewer, tired after three infinite hours of "alternative" soap opera. At the end I understand the meaning of the title: probably the unconscious influence for Anderson (so promising in "Boogie Nights") was "Steel Magnolias". Very bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I thought Hard Eight was a better film than Boogie Nights, and I feel once again that P.T. Anderson has taken a step backward with Magnolia. It seems that with Anderson, bigger stars and bigger budgets make for less clear storytelling, more padding, and less of an ultimate point to the movie. Magnolia is a very ambitious work technically, but he did nothing to rein in the performances, or the 3 hour length. This movie would have been much improved with some serious edits. It ends up being a very beautifully shot, well-scored, multi-layered, three hour lecture about bad parenting. Tom Cruise does give a very entertaining performance as an out-of-control guy's guy. It's easy to see why this kind of role works when you consider that Anderson did nothing to hold his actors back. Julianne Moore and Melora Walters, on the other hand, suffer the most, because their roles are very thin and their acting (i.e., shouting) is relentlessly, annoyingly, very loud. Maybe fewer characters would have served Anderson's purpose a little better. But economy was not the motive here -- why have one aging TV exec father who is dying of cancer when you can have two? The plague of frogs falling from the sky embodies my point: technically and visually very unique and appealing idea, with absolutely no point to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I had very different reactions to this film. At the end, I mentioned being disappointed because I'd heard it was supposed to be a 3-hour long film, and clearly it was only half that. My friend complained bitterly about experiencing every single tedious moment of the 3 hours! Clearly, this sort of drama doesn't appeal to everyone, but from the first moment, I was completely absorbed in a zen-like, moment-to-moment experience. The complex and subtle interleaving of the stories, the high caliber of most of the performers, the voice of Aimee Mann's music speaking as another character in the story-line- an approach to story-telling that sweeps you along. William Macy and Julianne Moore were touchingly convincing in their roles, but this film really belongs to John C. Reilly, whose role as the compassionate and human police officer (criminally overlooked by the awards nominators) anchors the other characters and focuses the theme of redemption. Not a perfect film because of two incredible flaws. 1) Silicone frogs are not a substitute for real plot resolution. What was the director thinking? 2) Tom Cruise is no substitute for a real actor. Perhaps these flaws make the rest of this very risky film seem all the more intriguing, but judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best ensemble piece, almost ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so proud to have seen this movie. I am a lover of films, but I have never felt this proud of a movie and its director for achieving so much. Proud is the only word that comes to mind. PT Anderson is way ahead of his game as an artist and a filmmaker. Magnolia is a work of art.We've seen Pulp Fiction and we've seen Go and many other wonderfully creative films that intertwine the lives of a long list of characters, but none of them do it as unexpectedly and subtly as Magnolia. With as many as nine main characters, each exhausted with the pain they experience in their lives, the film unfolds beautifully in its strange form of storytelling, also avoiding the cliches of "we are all depressed people" movies.I must also add that what I look for most in films of such buzz is good acting. I was overwhelmed by the performances in this film. The standouts are Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore, both of whom deserve oscars, but the rest of the cast was also amazing. Also perfect dramatic subtlety in the music, wonderful lines, and some twisted scenes. Lovers of film NEED to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too loose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a lot--probably too much for it's own good. Yes, the film is loaded with parallels, symbols, and metaphors, enough for endless discussion. However, much of it is noise, drowning out the message--but maybe that's the point.The following includes detail from the film:The opening 'coincidence' series and its reappearance later was a completely wasteful and unnecessary ploy; too much of a spelling-out, as it is quite a turn-off to be told what the film may be about before anything meaningful happens.And even the introductory scene that followed, while interesting, could have been scrapped.Story is sacrificied for these tidbits of form.For example: Did we need Tommie (old quiz whiz) just for the sake of his parallel, Stanley (new quiz whiz)? Yes, it is the past and the future colliding in the same guise--very clever &amp; we have another (among others) with Jimmy Gator and Earl Partridge--but was Tommie even remotely connected or captivating? So what, he steals some money.Yet many believe that liberation from the strictures of story is what is so great about Magnolia. I disagree because if ultimately Anderson wanted to convey a message, how would he do it?--through story. And to the extent that the story is tight, the message becomes more important to the audience.This film can only be thought of as brilliant if Anderson intended its structure to parallel its theme--that poorly thought-out decisions will follow you and the ensuing chaos cannot be stopped, controlled or prevented, sometimes appearing incoherent and ultimately left unresolved.That is to say, Anderson lost control of the film, like Magnolia's characters lost control over their lives (e.g., cancer, peeing in pants, addiction), and we (the audience), like the characters, had to deal with the inescapable and torturous mess.BTW: Magnolia is the name of the street in which Claudia lives. I heard that when Anderson began writing Magnolia he intended it as a story about Claudia. Perhaps he chose that name early on as a working title because it was associated with Claudia and never changed it. And I don't buy the point that the name is a metaphor for the film because it has as many story lines and layers as the magnolia has petals--it still doesn't explain why he specifically chose the magnolia of all flowers because, as you know, many flowers have numerous petals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a word, "Magnolia" was a disappointment. I'm a big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's previous work, but it seems here that he thought it was time for him to make an "epic film." You know, one which challenges the viewer to look "deep inside themselves," and learn something about themselves. That's the attitude it projects, but it comes up horribly short. Instead "Magnolia" turned out to be a bunch of barely related plots woven together to formulate the point that coincidences happen, and " wow! Isn't life strange!" Along the way the film tries to explore regret, forgiveness, anger and sympathy among family members. (Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't) But at about 3 hours, "Magnolia's" poor qualities overwhelm the good ones. Also, Tom Cruise tries way to hard to shatter his good boy image; his scenes as a male domination guru are quite embarrasing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost had me fooled....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is a movie that has fooled many people, including the creator, into thinking that it is deep, insightful, and thought-provoking. First of all, it is a bit over three hours long. Has to be meaningful, right? Wrong. And here is why.1) Good acting--yes, the acting was incredible. I'll give it that. However, acting does not create meaning in a film, it only enhances it.2) Biblical references--many people assume that anything that is related to the Bible is deeply important in their own lives. However, this is not always the case. The pertinent Bible verse here (Exodus 8:12) is simply a factual verse--there isn't a lesson which can be learned from it, at least, not in the context of this movie.3) Connecting characters--but, you say, there are so many characters, so many stories which are connected at the end! So? Just because one person's life relates to another doesn't mean it relates to mine. Plus, many of the 'connections' are very thin, and about half of the ways they relate the plots together turn out to be simple familial relationships, which really have no meaning.So, instead of understanding something new about myself (which I did after I saw American Beauty), I spent three hours in a seat trying very hard to do so. That was the only thing that kept me in the seat, honestly. Very few of the many plots were developed well enough for me to care what happened. The characters were, with the exception of the child Stanley, completely psychotic and seemed to bring their own troubles upon them and then attempt to solve those problems by saying the 'F word' repeatedly. I think this movie had more swearing than South Park.The minimal entertainment value came from Tom Cruise's character and the pure hilarity of seeing frogs falling from the sky.Sure, this movie made me think some things. Weird stuff happens. Don't cheat on your wife. That sort of thing. But nothing that could really change the way I thought about myself, which is obviously what it was trying to do. In other words, 3 hours wasted. I give it about 1 point per hour--a 3 out of 10.If you found something in the movie that I missed, please email me. I'd really like to change my mind about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of 1999. I had high expectations for Anderson's (what's with this "P.T." stuff anyway) follow up to Boogie Nights. He had signed up one of the best ensemble casts of the year - William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Thomas, Jason Robards, and even Tom Cruise. Nevertheless, after sitting through Magnolia for more than 3 hours, the predominant thought I had was that Anderson should be taken out back and shot.The first ten minutes of the movie were by far its best. Although this Prologue doesn't include any of the main characters, it tells three implausible stories that are entertaining and succinct. Unfortunately, Anderson had no such aspirations for the rest of the movie. The prologue introduces the theme of implausible coincidence, which Anderson reintroduces about 2 hours into the film in a most unsatisfying way: so the characters lives are intertwined - aren't most lives? so they pass the same intersection in the Valley - doesn't everyone? By the time it (implausibly) rains frogs on the Valley, I'm ready to leave the movie. This is perhaps one of the most arrogant sequences in recent memory - it's like Anderson is shouting "Look how brilliant I am!" but the result is truly disgusting.For a movie that is at its heart about the characters, I found it difficult to care about any of the characters. Are we supposed to be amused by the irony that Tom Cruise's character can bed women? Is it shocking that his boorish, misogynistic behavior has family issues at its roots? Give me a break.I found this movie to be a tremendous waste of time - the great cast's, Anderson's, and the audience's. Don't add yourself to this list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessive, meandering "art" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was horrible! It simply never goes anywhere. It's clearly trying to be some "artsy" and "deep" character-driven movie, and in fact it thinks that it has succeeded. Sad to say that after wasting three hours of my life, I discovered that it had failed on all accounts. The characters are not richly developed - they all have these epiphanies that come from out of nowhere at the end, their actions are contrived simply to make things look good, and they act like nice little stereotypes more than anything else. For a three hour movie, you think you'd actually learn a lot about the characters and learn to like them, but instead you just get shells of all these people. There were too many excessive shots that directors like, but have nothing at all to do with advancing the story. You'd think that all these lives would interconnect in some sort of interesting way at the very end, but that never happens. Instead, a couple of insignificant and obscure connections are made to try and unite the story. The ending leaves you dumbstruck as to how you could have wasted three hours of your life. Overall, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Save your money and watch American Beauty instead (even if you've already seen it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming, shrieking, overwrought, hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret, guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent, and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself, but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD. In short, a good movie to look at and listen to (the music, that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been</fullReview>

Man, this was a trip of a film, you keep going back and forth between stories, which eventually I did understand why the director did it that way. It really isn't an optimistic film, it's very dark and disturbing.Still, this was indeed a good film, there really were not that many complaints I had about it, other than it's length I felt could have been a little shorter. It basically is just about these characters who all have something horrible going on in their lives. But as it turns out when you figure it all out, they all kind of revolve around one another. I also have to admit, we have some terrific performances, such as: Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the little boy who plays the child protegdy.A few weird elements, but an extremely gripping story, I can see where people really enjoyed this film and made it into the top 250. Not my personal favorite and not a movie I'd really watch again and again, it was just too depressing. But still, I do know a good movie when I watch it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-indulgent Short-Cuts rip-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am i the only person who thinks that "Magnolia" is, at it's very best, a kind of half-asses rip-off of Robert Altman's great film "Short Cuts"? I mean, Paul Thomas Anderson is obviously very influenced by Altman, even if just judging by "Boogie Nights", and the similarities between the two films are very numerous. Both are ensemble films that take place over the course of one day, and are set in Los Angeles. Also, both films are very long (actually, they happen to be with a few minutes of each other's running time). But even so, i'd probably still dislike "Magnolia" even if this weren't the case. I just find the film very melodramatic and unsubtle, and parts of it i find incredibly lame, like the part where everyone is singing that song, and the whole bit with the frogs at the end. I mean, i understand the point of it, the whole theme of redemption and whatnot, but i don't think it needed to be so over-the-top about it. Overall i just found the film very self-indulgent, and most of the characters too one-dimensional, as though they only existed in order to prove a point, rather than tell a good story. I do think that Paul Thomas Andrson is basically a good filmmaker though. I really liked both "Boogie Nights" and "Punch-Drunk Love", and his obvious natural talent with a camera shows even a little bit in "Magnolia". I find it odd though, that whereas "Boogie Nights" totally entertained me and absorbed me into a story about a subject that objectively doesn't really interest me much (the porn industry from the late 70s to mid 80s), "Magnolia" presented characters one would find in everyday life, but that i really didn't care at all about.</fullReview>

The dialogue is sappy, vacuous, and frequently leaves me embarrassed for the writer and actors who are connected to it. But what makes this movie truly painful to watch is the rediculous events that take place in the movie. Most of all, the awful Amy Mann song that the cast sings in unison. Up there with "Our Town" and "Oklahoma" as some of the most boring pieces of writing of all time.

I really, really wanted to but just absolutely could not do it!After reading some reviews, and remembering all the nominations this one garnered I really expected a top-notch movie. I was, sadly, quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong--the performances were excellent, the direction masterful, and the cinematography captivating. However, after two hours into it, and realizing I still had another to go, I just no longer cared what happened to the characters. It just didn't catch my attention that way. I really felt that this was one of those movies where the "star power" carried it through. For me, the way the film cut from scene to scene and character to character made it quite impossible to get to the point where I truly wanted to see how all the storylines ended. So, as I mentioned, two hours into the film, I just had to stop it. I couldn't take it any longer.Obviously I am in the minority here, but if you too are the type who likes a straight-forward story, steer clear of Magnolia. However, if you are wanting to see some really solid performances and a strangely disjointed story--go for it!</fullReview>

I ask these question because Magnolia is one of the two or three worst movies ever made, and for the same director to make two horrible movies yes boogie nights is horrible also, he must thrive on bad film making because he seems so good at it.

		<fullReview>The opening of this film was fascinating. Had the opening anything to do with the rest of the film at all, either in style, intensity, or substance, this would have been a great film. Instead, it's a disaster. At 3 hours, it's just about 2.5 hours too long. The beginning is actually interesting and you are dying to see how they will tie this large variety of characters together in the end. Guess what: they don't! There are two completely disjoint sets of characters with no connection other than a "produced by" sign. That's bad enough, but then we have lots of characters that seem to have no point. The boy contestant on the game show? The wife who overdoses? What point was there in killing the dog? What ties they did create were very weak. What is even worse if how the show deteriorates into monologues near the end. They go on FOREVER. I found myself praying for a scene change so we could get on with the movie. Then came the Jason Robarts monologue that goes on even longer, with really no point to it (and it wasn't supposed to exist if you followed everything they said). The scene changes and he just won't shut up. He keeps talking over other scenes for a long time. I won't comment on the "everybody sings with Ammie Mann" part...Then, there's the big surprise ending. It would have been best described as Deus ex Machina except that it really didn't affect the ending other than to make a point that this file is "arty". It was stupid and should not have been included. I love experimental films. I love a film that is challenging to understand. But, I don't love bad films that are really more like someone's drug trip than anything else. This is a truly bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia wilts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, in the style of Robert Altman's best films, covers a lot of different characters, each doing their own thing in vignettes that seem independent but are actually intricately intertwined. Director Paul Thomas Anderson's last movie, Boogie Nights, examined the seemly underbelly of the pornography business (okay, so maybe there isn't another kind) while making all of his characters real. He attempts the same kind of reality with Magnolia, but the results are a lot spottier and unsatisfying.The centerpiece of the movie is Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), a motivational speaker/showman whose act is aimed squarely at the macho, testosterone-laden male on a quest to bed down with every attractive woman he can get his hands on. Frank's real successful with his career, and the movie takes us through a typical presentation of his act to a small crowd. While this is going on, several other scenes are taking place, including a quiz show pitting adults against kids, a dying old man (Jason Robards), the breakdown of the old man's younger wife (Julianne Moore), an inept and thickheaded cop (John C. Reilly), and a miserable former child star (William H. Macy). You may note that some of those actors also appeared in Boogie Nights. The cast is well-picked, to be sure, but sadly almost every performance is overblown and overstated. (Except, of course, for the dying Robards.)At over 3 hours long, Magnolia would test anyone's patience. But really, even if it had been chopped in half (thus eliminating a lot of superfluous plot), the result probably wouldn't have been much better. In some cases, a shorter movie means more confusion; but with so many characters and so many things happening to each one, this was far more complicated than it needed to be. The end result is that the viewer wonders what the point is.Cruise was nominated for an Oscar for his work here, but I don't think it's even among his best work (Born on the Fourth of July still is). If you're a female, you'll easily be turned off by his character's opinions and actions; and if that's the point, it's a badly illustrated point. And really none of the other characters stands out as a fine performance. In fact, because Anderson's characters don't seem all that real to us - and this is achieved because they're one-dimensional - the viewer will likely lose interest in their plights. Let's face it, if a character doesn't appeal to you, you don't care what he or she does or what happens to them. Writers have to learn to establish character appeal. This doesn't mean the character has to be a nice person, just interesting. Give your audience a reason to care!Oh, and don't get me started on over-emoting. When it's not Cruise screaming into a cell phone, it's Moore in a drug-addled craze screeching at her lawyer. Ho-hum, ho-hum.I will say this much for the movie, though. The ending is NOT to be believed, and I mean that in a good way. Almost makes up for the first 170 minutes. This is a mix of acting badly and badly acting. Skip it.</fullReview>

And there would still have enough curse words left in the movie to leave the impression intact. This is the movie of Drug Addicts, child molester, Spouse cheaters, misogynist, humiliated kids etc. Some of them are dying from cancer, almost all of them are feeling guilty about their past. Probably this and the reason that some Judeo-Christian biblical references were made throughout the movie (out of ignorance, I didn't understand or appreciate any of it); I guess the reviewers on IMDb found the movie so philosophically intriguing. A good number of reviewers actually find this movie relating to real life around them.I don't come across people (that I know of) who are child molester or spouse cheaters and I am yet to see a person dying from cancer and making confessions about dark past. So I couldn't relate to it and from my perspective it's a pointless movie with brilliant acting performances. Movie is depicted mostly in realistic fashion, except that there is a dense frog rain, sometimes characters become singers (All in same rhyme) and there was a reference made (twice) to 3 unrelated short stories where chance had unrealistic dominance. May be this was done to artificially stir the viewer's brain into pointless thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of total and utter 1 c**p - don't waste your time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awful is my vote, and so is this "movie".What amazes me is when you start reading the reviews of this on IMDb, it starts out by a couple of raving reviews, with totally uncomprehensible meaning and reasons other than saying the actors were great, then underneath is loads and loads and loads of reviews like the present one, saying it is a total piece of nonsense, utter waste of time, one of the worst movie every made - just absolutely boring and terrible and horrible...And this movie, gets an 8/10 rating??? How can that be when so many people despise it and give is 1 or no stars.I am really at lost to understand this.I have seen so many just bad movies getting high rates and so many outstanding getting poor rates, but this is beyond the top, making one wonders what's the meaning of all this.Totally depressing movie, and sick people liking this one or finding anything in it, just snobs, empty and lost shells.Hardly ever before has a film made me feel so bad. Only encouraging sign is to read loads and loads of reviews like this one, just despising the whole thing.Some people were smarter, though, as they just walked out of it.As for me it was the first movie I downloaded in blue ray style, and I could not accelerate through it as I could with the other ones. At the end, though, I did, sparing me a few minutes of my life, spent washing this total dread.If you want to go and see a movie that will make you feel horrible and so terribly bad - just go to see this one.Sh*t!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three hours to the brink of hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ambitious film suffers most from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's delusions of grandeur. Highly derivative of much better material (Altman's "Nashville," Lumet's "Network"), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. A couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. Neither does the uneven level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing angst. And how many times must we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will suffice)? Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison ? his misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing. Speaking of foul mouths, the script was so loaded with "F" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Don't even talk about that awful soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann. Her extended rendition of "One," a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the start of the film. I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours, by which time I'd been pushed to the brink of hell. One redeeming feature, which I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction. Her credibility exceeded all others by far. This film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was only after the credits starting rolling that I realised how absolutely brilliant this movie is! It was a whirlwind of a ride over a period of 3 hours beginning with an introduction which places you right at the centre and an ending which makes your head spin. It's life and it makes you wonder what you're doing with yours and how your life is affecting others. Everything is interconnected and escaping is never an answer to any problem. You see the development of characters and each one breaks down to the bare core of human nature. I have to admit that I was stunned by Cruise's performance and I would say it's one of his best which is a lot considering I'm not a big fan of his. Watch it, it's mind-boggling and so spot on!</fullReview>

This has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same issues he had with "There Will Be Blood" (though he wasn't quite as bad in that film. The whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities. It's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks "how would a great filmmaker handle this scene?" He just doesn't have it in him. I don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker. There were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to ripen. The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history. One by one as we see the characters singing, and I squirmed in my seat, I kept saying "please, PLEASE, just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing, too!" Sure enough, MASSIVE FAILURE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens with a couple of mini-stories, showing how coincidence works amongst people. The idea is to give you an idea of what you're about to see. The rest of the 3 hours tells the stories of 9 characters. But, it's more of following the lives of 9 people. There isn't much story here. Each scene isn't very entertaining. And nothing about the entire movie grabs your attention. I feel the ending is the straw that breaks the camel's back. In a story that has been built as "true" as a movie can be, why throw in a something so ridiculous, something you would expect to see in a "Hot Shots" type movie. Very weird choice. I was disappointed, constantly believing the movie was going to get better, but it didn't. For those who think the movie is great, ask yourself, what happened in it. And when you sum up the entire story in 2 sentences, you'll realize there was no need for this movie to take 3 hours to tell this.</fullReview>

I was intrigued for the first 2 hours and 50 minutes, but the end was anti-climactic to say the least. It doesn't matter how good the beginning or middle of a story is if it disappoints in the end. Whoever wrote the story had a good thing going, but just didn't know how to wrap it up, so he made frogs rain from the sky. Sheesh, is there no creativity left in America anymore? If you want to see a good movie with lots of characters, lots of stories intermingling, put together the right way, I suggest taking a look at "Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels", "Snatch", or "Intermission".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a very thin line between emotionally intense and downright corny: movies that dare come close to that line usually end up as either masterpieces or complete garbage. Magnolia definitely falls right into the first category.As I was coming to right this review, I was thinking about what really makes this movie so good. Yes, the final product is fantastic, but where does it really jumps out as really unique? Maybe it is the music, which plays in the background for most of the movie and it is so beautiful and sometimes is almost like a character, and some other times it helps filling in gaps in the process of understanding the meaning of what's being told. Or maybe it is the rich, unique characters that populate every part of the movie, and how they connect to each other and form a big web of a very human drama? I guess it could as well be the cinematography, with some really interesting long shots, in which the director simply leaves the camera lying somewhere and lets the cast do what they know best.Yes, it could be any of those things but what I really see as the best thing to come from Magnolia is how Paul Thomas Anderson can build this really big universe, with several complex characters, and simply use it to tell another story that's bigger than that, or, more accurately, to do a personal exercise on human relations, throwing in a lot of elements that are only related to that exercise and mixing them into the story, which sometimes result in pure surrealism.Hard Eight was good, Boogie Nights was great, and Magnolia is just out of this world. If you love the movies, do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already.(10/10)</fullReview>

Somehow all the characters are linked thru a TV show "what do kids know", and the main background stories all have to do with fathers who force their kids in different ways and the kids knowing this (even if only at a later time in their lives) and reacting to this parental violence.Overall, the characters and the acting in the scenes are more of the soap-opera type, except of course for the over the top performance of Tom Cruise as male self-assurance/macho technique trainer, who saves the film from being only - rather dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can appreciate the diversity of opinion about this film. I think that that diversity is a good sign of a film that really touched the audience. Unfortunately, I think that some group thought is occurring here though. One third of the voters on this site gave the movie a 10. Come on people!I enjoyed watching Julianna Moore as much as a lot of you probably enjoyed watching Tom Cruise, but let's not get carried away in movie star hype. This movie had a lot of big names and quite a few excellent performances, but at it's core there is a failed story. The writer shows great ability and depth of storytelling as he leads us into the fictional dream, but with each twist, turn and knot of this tale we are promised an even bigger finish. I'm sorry folk. We didn't get it!Magnolia, with the exception of the group sing along scene, was promising to be one of the most daring and thought provoking films that I have ever seen. The beginning set the pace and the performances of the actors drew us in. Yes, by the time that amphibians start raining from the sky, we really care about these characters. Good job, Mr. Writer. But wait, did I just say that amphibians started falling from the sky?I believe that there are two prevailing schools of thought (excuse the cliché) in regards to this movie. One is that the frog storm was a satirical device to show the futility of life and that despite the torments of our individual lives, none of it really matters on a cosmic level. Maybe the writer is telling us that things may be bad, but at least frogs aren't falling from the sky.The second school of thought would be that the writer wrote an amazing story but couldn't close the deal. Every writer knows that it is easier to conceive Revelations than it is to write Armageddon. Yeah, you may have a great story, but that does not guarantee that you will have an ending to match. In truth, the better the story, the harder it is to come up with an ending. When you start a tale, you make a promise to the audience. You essentially say, bear with me for awhile, suspend disbelief, give me a few hours of your life (or three hours and eight minutes in this case.) You promise the audience that their investment of time will reap huge rewards. Then you introduce them to characters and draw them into situations. You make them feel something and more eagerly anticipate some resolution. Now you are promising them that not only their time, but their emotional investment will all be worth it. The longer the film, the more engrossing situations, the better the acting, serves to raise the stakes. Before closing credits roll, people begin to have remembrances of the great stories of Dickens, Shakespeare and Capote. So all that is left is to pay the piper, close the story with a bang and send them home crying. Should be simple right?Obviously not! Maybe you realize somewhere along the way that you have written a story bigger than you are. Maybe you have started Great Expectations and you are only able to finish with Pee Wee's big adventure. The disappointed audiences will feast upon the carcass of you that the film credits leave behind. That's if they even hear your tale after word of it's failure gets out. So what do you do? You distract them. You drop frogs from the sky and call it "avant garde!" I truly believe that this is what happened here.Of course, that is just my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>=====Magnolia (running time 180 min)===== Since Pulp Fiction, there's been a number of movies trying to intertwine numerous story lines, and none of which I've seen have succeeded. Now I've seen (the first parts of) Go (1999) and Magnolia (1999) and they both fail miserably. The main problem is that while the story is directed towards the undoubtedly brilliant climax, it forgets to keep the audience interested.Would I have seen it in the theater, I would probably have finished it and loved it, but when you watch it on video there is this irresistible tendency to push the eject button. I'll give it an honest rating later when I've entirely watched it, but for now I recommend you to only watch it if you've got nothing else to do and if you've got oceans of time on your hands. *(out of five)</fullReview>

The much touted performances (with the notable exceptions of John C. Reilly and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who were both excellent) were prime examples of what happens when you allow an actor to "go the distance". Subtlety goes right out the window and in come the tears and the shouting. The script only adds to the problem. How many "dysfuntional-people-at-the-end-of-their-tethers-and-about-to-snap" can we jam into one film? I didn't like or dislike the characters, I just wanted them to shut up. Another problem is the complete lack of humour of any kind whatsoever. Even the most serious and heavy handed dramas need at least a few laughs. It makes everything more human. The only time I laughed during this movie was in the ridiculous sing-a-long segment, and I don't think I was supposed to. But the main problem is this- I know I'm hardly the first person to state this, and I know I won't be the last, but I've seen this film before. It's called Short Cuts. As far as I'm concerned, a film as near perfect as that needs no restatement. A great opening twenty minutes and the performances of the above mentioned actors allows this movie to squeak in with a 3 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a dumb person and yet fancy that you are intelligent, you will love this film.Magnolia contains many elements that seem to have become trendy recently - numerous interlocking plots; millions of characters; bleak subject matter; death, illness, depression, abuse, and so on. For three, gut-wrenchingly awful hours it STRIVES to be clever, it YEARNS to be some sort of 'dark, cinematic masterpiece', and the result is a mediocre, heavy-handed mess. The one thing this film really lacks is SUBTLETY. For example, one character is a child wiz kid who is thrust into stardom by his pushy, overbearing father (now there's an original idea). Just to make it ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR to all those in the audience that haven't cottoned on to the fact that the kid is being used by his parents, you get 'subtle scenes' like this -(1) Dad watches kid on the show and says to other parents "okay, let's make some money!"(2) child wants to leave the set and go to the bathroom but for NO apparent reason (other than to demonstrate cruelty of the parents) his request is refused and he wets himself. "oh gosh, they really ARE mean to the poor little tacker aren't they!"This is just one of many examples where Magnolia miserably fails to deliver. Others include:Tom Cruise's 'Frank Mackey'. His performance has been described by some as 'scintillating', but I found it unwatchable in parts. He was ok in the less-demanding scenes, but when he was striding around yelling lines like "worship the cock!" I just laughed my head off. A good actor could have pulled this role off - but Tom is not a good actor - he's an average actor who is made to look good when he plays non-challenging roles (ie: cocky, brash, good-looking guy fighting the good fight - Top Gun, Days of Thunder, Rain Man, Jerry Maguire etc) When stretched, he stinks).William H Macy's character was an abysmal waste of time.The quiz kid plot was simplistic and overdone.The only characters of any interest of all were the policeman (played superbly by John C Reilly) and the junkie he falls in love with. This was the only plotline that drew any emotional or intellectual response from me at all. </fullReview>

I am a big fan of hyper link cinema and this one is a fine example. How you can entertain people with the story is answered with this movie. This is one of those films when you would definitely not notice the time even if it is 3 hours. The acting has definitely to be praised particularly of LINDA and also Tom Cruise.

The list actually goes on, but I find I am getting bored just writing it down. So I have to assume the flaw is in the direction and writing.

It's also very difficult to get into the plot. I didn't even understand what was going on at first, where the plot was. It just seemed like lots of people were wandering around on screen without reason.Secondly, it had so many swear words in it that it had to be turned into an 18, which I found unnecessary. The film would have been so much better without all the bad words. Also, another thing I didn't understand was the frog rain near the end! What exactly was that supposed to signify? All the sadness that was going on? What exactly did it mean? I would have liked it if that, and all the various stories of all the characters were explained a little better.I wouldn't waste my time with this 3-hour film, you'll regret it.

		<shortDescription>Torture to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie comes along like zapping channels on TV. No matter how hard you try, there is no means to understand the many lose ends of those uncountable threads. Although it reminded me to Robert Altman's "Shortcuts" it lacks the genius behind the development of this movie. Confusing, hysterical, great soundtrack (sometimes) and outstanding performance of the cast would describe this movie best. And leeeengthy. After the end you look into your neighbor's face, confused, and watch the same expression there. Maybe I needed to watch this thread of hopping pictures 5 times in order to get a glimpse what the makers meant. But sorry, no,no,no. What a waste of time and money this would be! Sorry for the great performance of actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What in the world?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, this comment will contain a few spoilers. It's my sincerest hope that, by the end, you won't want to watch this horrible film and will have lost nothing anyway. (It might even save you some lost time.) I was astounded to learn that "Magnolia" was written by one person. Watching the movie, I got the idea that the screenplay came about after a night of the old' "story game", where four or five friends sit in a circle and take up for the last person. The problem with THIS story circle, however, was that one guy had to bring along his obnoxious cousin: the one that everyone knows, the one that no one likes. We'll call him "Jimmy".The story starts pretty well and everyone's having a good time, . . . and then it's Jimmy's turn. Whenever it's Jimmy's turn, the plot flies out the window and is replaced by utter nonsense. "Okay, so there's this new guy, and he's a woman hunter!!! Yeah! He's so good at hunting women, he gives seminars on it. He's interviewed for TV because he's so good at hunting women! The reporter tries to ask him dumb questions about his background, but he knows what's what and steers her back to what's important!" It only gets worse. Three characters, none of them in the same location, none of them with radios or television sets on, all start singing along with the movie's soundtrack. I don't want to share the ending, but if you were playing the story game and someone tried to foist this ending on you, you would throw your hands up and walk away in disgust. (Look it up elsewhere if you're curious.) There are several other moments in the film that made me shake my head and practically curse at the stupidity; I've managed to block them from my mind.Aside from Jimmy's moments, the movie is arguably an enjoyable "slice of life" film. There's just no way to suspend one's disbelief when those moments roll around. I broke the DVD in half after watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These strange things happen all the time?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What begins with some of the most innovative and intriguing opening sequences of film-making, plummets deep into one of the most tedious and pointless movies that I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. There might have been some brilliant observations being made on the human psyche or the silly things we humans do, but they were buried so deep within experimental, self-indulgent film-making that the viewer is confounded most of the times, ultimately unsatisfied and bored.Magnolia sets records in poor film-making that will be difficult to better. From the time the credits start to roll, the tedium begins. Oh, and I must speak about the credit sequence. There is a song that begins when the name of the film and few of the characters are introduced. You would naturally expect the song to stop after the characters start talking, wouldn't you? But P T Anderson apparently thinks otherwise. Well into a few minutes of characters starting their dialogues, the song bellows on. I was forced to watch an English movie with English sub-titles! This is ridiculous! This happens even towards the end of the movie - the characters talk for well over a few minutes, while yet another jarring song plays at twice the volume of their speech.The dialogues too, are nothing short of precedent-setting. Expletives flow freely, nauseating you with the incomprehensibly misplaced effect they try to have. I find it so hard to believe that such juvenile dialogues got past the editing shears. The dialogues seem to have been ad-libbed or written out in a very short while, as they have absolutely no impact whatsoever. The writer has a teenager's fascination to cuss words, which are used ten times to the dozen.Throughout the film, the one single emotion that was evoked in me was of helplessness. I was helpless as I saw people fighting, screaming at each other, hurting each other. I was helpless as I saw the simple things that the characters could have done to make their lives easier, but never realised them. Every single leaf in this Magnolia tree seem rotten from within, when there's no reason for it to be so. The director has rendered each one of them so irritating that it is hard to bear with them. The decisions they take are implausible and their regret is laughable. P T Anderson was extremely successful in rendering every single emotion of every single character artificial and stressed. Their pain, their anger, their sorrow is all so plastic that our only reaction is glassy-eyed disinterest.The story is broken into too many parts to be described. The individual pieces were neither interesting nor entertaining. Characters are half-baked and attempts at exploring them without providing us with the context adds up to much chagrin. The story of the movie has been highly touted for the numerous intersections that the individual characters have. The intersections are achieved merely by not telling us the complete story. If the director begins by telling the story from the middle, it is but obvious that we would have missed the introductions of the cast and their relationship with each other! Magnolia is a tiring, pointless movie, which is best avoided if you don't want to ruin a good part of your day (it seems to run for about 15 hours!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very rare occurrence indeed when I switch off the DVD player, look at the blank screen, and think to myself, "Just now, I have wasted 3 precious hours of my life that I can never get back." Magnolia is one of those films that makes the movie intelligentsia coo and gurgle to each other, "Genius! Brilliant! Ground-breaking!" They snuggle together and talk about how the "ending tied things all together" and "the deeper meanings" of each tiny detail.But to me, it was over three hours of disjointed (or nonexistent) plot, disconnected emotional threads, blatant misogyny, pointless emoting, screaming, swearing and sweating, and such amateurish character development that I literally didn't give a sh*t what happened to anyone in the entire film (with the possible exception of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who manages to save this film as he has so many others). The predictable ending did exactly nothing for me. The biblical overtones were obvious and ridiculous.A waste of time. A tremendous waste of time, money, talent. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel compelled to write this review because the only thing I've read so far on this movie has been glowing tribute.Sure, it's a glossy, slick production that on the surface appears to be something special. However, their use of sound in the movie was annoying. Case in point, the very last scene, the soundtrack swelled so much I couldn't make out what they were saying. So much for tying it all up. The first few scenes were also marred by too much sound behind it. IF any of the parts in between the middle and the end interested me at all, I MIGHT try to listen to it again, but what's the point when the rest stunk too?As for the characters, there were some well acted pieces. What the actors had to work with. The character development was not really there. I found I didn't care one bit about ANY of the characters, their dramas were dis-interesting, despite the attempt of the creators to 'pull our strings' with predictable emotional response situations such as death, child abuse, public humiliation and adultery.And fellas, when it rains frogs, it's not a non-stop downpour. How many frogs do you think LIVE in one lake or pond?Don't rent this movie. Hang wallpaper instead. It's much more entertaining.</fullReview>

This three-hour movie has dialogue about as exciting as watching paint dry. I got the feeling that no-one had any idea what they were doing after the second hour, but there was still some budget left, so they just kept on shooting.Hate someone?

		<shortDescription>What's That Smell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since Paul Thomas Anderson has made a film, and a fresh look at "Magnolia" gives you a good clue why.Despite a million dollar cast including Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reily, Tom Cruise, Phillip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Luiz Guzman and Jason Robards (this was his last feature. It's debatable if this film killed him) the film is dull, pretentious and insufferable. However, it does contain one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes in all of motion pictures: the scene where it starts raining frogs in the San Fernando Valley.Paul Thomas Anderson went on to make the equally overrated but somewhat better "Punch Drunk Love" before seeming to disappear from the silver screen for awhile. I guess he just hasn't found any financing for "Magnolia II: the Frogs Strike Back".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Potential, however Magnolia is Pretentious, Depressing, Tasteless, Unrelenting and especially Boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Effective story telling is a dying art in cinema, and there are few better illustrations of this than P.T Anderson's torturous 'thought provoking' drama Magnolia. This film is like a horrific car wreck, you will feel the urge to look but you know you really shouldn't, and you WILL be punished for doing so. This is a film that is one minute completely realist and the next totally outrageous, it's all over the place! I have not seen his other works, and they might not be emotional dramas, but judging by this showing ole P.T should not attempt anything emotional or anything drama and *especially* anything intelligent ever again unless he seriously attempts to develop his craft. I am no film director so sue me if you think I'm harsh on this man's talent, but I simply found this almost unbearable to watch, it may have been because I felt degraded and dirty for even agreeing to be subjected to it. In this film Anderson shows unrelenting disrespect, bordering on disdain, for his audience, mistaking emotionally powerful for shouting, screaming and the most ridiculous over use of the F word in many, many years. I rented this film HOPING for a bleak but haunting analysis of the human condition, however what I was put through is a melodrama that plays out like the most grotesque social horror movie ever witnessed on screen. There is an old phrase something like 'when in a foreign country, if the locals don't understand you the first time then SHOUT a little louder!' That is what I guess was Anderson's philosophy here, it's not good enough to beat you round the head repeatedly with the message he's trying to get across but he has to do the same with the characters and their emotions, biblical references, images of Tom Cruise mincing around and most importantly the F word over and over and over....It's such a damn shame, Anderson might have important stories to tell, he might have important messages to convey but on this evidence only a very few (very patient) people are going to have the psyche to tolerate his films and extract them. He does not have a very refined or tasteful way of delivering his story OR message, preferring to thrust them into your face like Cruise's crotch and in the most over played, obvious manner imaginable. IMO he does not understand the word subtle. Such a waste, the opening narrated sequence hooked me right in, the stories of chance and urban legend had me expecting to be introduced to some outrageous characters faced with outrageous situations, with maybe a hint of the supernatural. What I got was a bunch of what I can only describe as complete masochists, and uninteresting ones at that. They make a hugely depressing story even more disconnected and beyond dull. The situations are challenging but they are hardly what I would describe as captivating. The characters range from Donnie (Macy) a former (parentally neglected) child star now an emotionally confused man with a fixation on a long haired barman, to Linda (Moore), a suicidal bitch with serious psychological and guilt issues who is married to a dying (extremely) old man who is trying to contact his long lost son (Cruise), exactly WHAT Cruise is in this movie I do not know, and some other losers. Hardly the most endearing bunch, all the characters stories are connected and we watch them go about life and stew in horrid situations all performed in the most outrageous and unbelievable manner, Moore is especially awful, waiting for their moment of enlightenment or redemption to hit. I don't insist a film be fast paced, contain CG scenes or graphic violence however in an emotional drama I simply demand to have at least one character presented that I would not mind walking the same streets as me never mind spend time with, not one is present here.I especially enjoyed the scene when Moore's hyper paranoid character exploded into a comical outburst of emotion while collecting some pills at the pharmacy, delightful. Then we had the old man gargling to Frank (Cruise) the shock revelation that he had cheated on his mother (that really left me reeling) and then dies, weep weep. Then Cruise starts shaking his dead long lost father and to show his raw emotion takes the expletive counter above the 1000 mark. The initially suggested story about chance situations that make you question what life is all about became an achingly stale story of swings and roundabouts, and basically a case of s*it happens, deal with it, with biblical references and added F words for extra impact. Any deep moral and emotional meaning Anderson intended was dissolved by what the eyes and ears were made to suffer. Another concept that had potential but somehow delivered a story that just sunk it's heels in then taunted the director to drag it painfully along while reducing the audience to tears of boredom (the only verity of tears I shed). By the time you are presented with the new take on an old chart classic - It's raining frogs, hallelujah! - and the masochists start a sing along session to some monotonous dirge your eyes, ears and brain might well feel the desire to detach from your head and seek cover. I always say see something for yourself, it's strange I can almost see why people might enjoy it, but it is for a very small crowd who's minds are firmly planted somewhere other than our world and they know who they are. In fact if you insist on seeing it watch the narrated bit then switch off and go make up your own elaborate story and add some colourful characters that you can empathize with, better still write it down and send it to P.T Anderson with the note - shouting + the F word does not always = emotionally charged. 3 for the setup, 0 for the execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. And I did at first--what a great opening! What a great set-up to the story! However, i it went absolutely nowhere. Ah, you might say...but that was the point. That was what made the movie so deep, so clever. Bull! The characters were one-dimensional, the dialog was uncreative, the music drowned out the dialog (though perhaps that was a blessing), and the film was agonizingly long. The acting was good, but their talents were totally wasted. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses, but she was the same in every scene. I got to the point where I just dreaded having to listen to her. Apart from the opening, the only thing that made the movie worth watching was the much-talked-about weather anomaly near the end of the film. And even that was only worth seeing because it was just so bizarre and different that you had to laugh. As one of my friends told me after she went to see Magnolia, despite my advising against it: "When you told me it was crap, why didn't you say that it was totally and completely ALL crap? You could've warned me!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a promisingly intriguing opening sequence to the movie, I was excited about its artistic potential. The next three hours proceeded to disappoint on those hopes. I know a lot of people loved Magnolia because of its artistic nature and its statement on the human condition, but I found it to be rambling and generally disappointing. When the story begins, we see many different characters who only share that they are in some sort of despair or depression. I expected that by the end of the movie the characters would all link together somehow. They didn't all have to rise from low points in their lives, I simply wanted to understand WHY we were seeing these characters, and what their connection was. But alas, it was not meant to be. Instead the next three hours proceeded lack in plot, intrigue, interesting dialogue, or any sort of major character development. In fact, basically all of the character development happened in the last ten minutes or so of the movie when it rains frogs (for some reason which is not even slightly addressed or questioned) and everyone suddenly understands their lives. This movie was a snooze fest (yes that is the technical term), and if your looking for something artistic and interesting, I'm sure you can do better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great storytelling makes a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an original movie for sure, that becomes one through its storytelling and just overall writing, all done by Paul Thomas Anderson. It's almost as if every story got written for- and made as a movie on its own. Every different storyline also sort of has its own style and approach to but not so that the movie starts to become fragmentary. Even though the different story lines are not connected to each other, the movie still manages to feel like one big whole, also probably because the movie never meanders but spends the right amount of time with each different storyline and cuts flawlessly back and forth between the different ones.It's the sort of movie that not reveals or makes clear everything right at the start. It really takes it time to setup things and its stories slowly start to unravel, as it heads toward its ending. So the storytelling might seem slow but it actually is a far from slow movie. There is always something happening and because the movie keeps going back and forth so much between its different stories the movie never allows itself to slow down. Another thing with the story is that every time you think the story will be heading into a certain direction, it will start to go somewhere else and unexpected with its story. I liked that things weren't always that clear or obvious right from the start. It also gets you more involved with its characters. You might even change your feelings toward them as the movie its story progresses and starts to take some unexpected twists and turns.Some of the story lines are connected through its characters but all of the story lines are connected through its themes. It's a drama, in which all of the characters are in search of something; love, happiness, forgiveness but also all in search of themselves. Some characters go through some powerful transitions, that besides feel very real. Most of its themes are universal and very easy to relate to, even if you have never been through any of them.Something this movie also of course really benefits from is its cast. Tom Cruise has maybe never been better and other well known actors such as Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards all make some strong appearances.I wouldn't call the movie brilliant or an absolute masterpiece but it simply is a really great and besides also original movie, that becomes so through its story, storytelling and acting. In other words; the 3 fundamental ingredients needed to make a great movie with!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I would also like to point out this has many amazing actors that do a great job. The acting in this movie isn't what bothered me. I know some may say that I'm just not seeing the artistic value the director / writer is trying to present. And I suppose that is a fair point of view.

		<shortDescription>The people who say they "get" Magnolia are showing inherent flaws in there intellect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnolia is an excellent example of a movie that sets you up for something big, but then fails to deliver. For starters, let's get this out of the way.Magnolia is not bad because of:A) The Acting -- Quite obviously the acting is superb.B) The Characters -- Entrancing, unique, interesting. We do care about these characters.C) The Weirdness -- Certainly helps the movie. Life is odd and haphazard.D) The Setup -- Wonderful setup. The intro piece leads you to want to know how all these characters connect and what the big coincidence is.Instead, the film is average because of the payoff. A plague of frogs falling from the sky is not a coincidence. I will agree that it does happen to all the characters at the same time, but that does not connect them. All the characters talk in breathe in the movie as well. Large events, shared by all is not a coincidental connection.The movie fails because the characters never have a large connection. There is nothing coincidental here. Sure the "prophet" runs into Reilly early and Moore near the end. Sure Reilly runs across Macy, but these are not the level of coincidence that the opening pieces allude too. (By the by, the three opening pieces are all tales of urban legend much told around the internet that never happened.) I understand what Anderson is trying to do, but he fails. He has a great many interesting touches, but the movie falls short, especially in comparison with a movie like American Beauty, which accomplishes the things Anderson is trying to do.Further, those trying to trumpet there own intelligence in the face of others balking at the movie are showing their own deficiencies. Those people are so starved to be in the know over what they deem "average" people, that they are quick to assume others don't "get" it. The truth is that many "get" it, but just don't want it. I will say that Anderson shows remarkable ability (Boogie Nights is still an amazing piece of work), but what he is best at is this -- knowing that if you undertake a project the size of Magnolia, it doesn't have to be perfect, intellectual wannabes will fill in the gaps for you in order to make themselves more God than mortal.Two and a half shields out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie for anyone who has ever wiped their butt, and ended up with poop all over their kneecaps. Or anyone who is addicted to amphetamines, and likes to listen to independent music really loud while they cry about getting raped. Remember in the 80s when there was that big scare of SRA, Satanic Ritual Abuse cults? This is a movie for anyone who knows that wasn't just a scare, it was the truth, Satanic Ritual Abuse cults existed then, they had for a while, and they still do now. Earl Partridge is the patriarch of one such cult, which is focused around the child game-show circuit, used as a cover to sort through children and pick out the ones most ripe for SRA. This movie shows the effects of SRA over time, both on the victims and the perpetrators. Organized rape-crime is NOT okay, especially when it's done in the name of Satan. Tom Cruise knows it, John Cusack knows it, Phillip Baker Hoffman knows it as well as Phillip Seymour Hall. When the scare was in the air... people said, that kind of organization, of chaos, it's too strange... it's not possible that this stuff is really going on, all those coincidences... are just that, coincidences. And that's what allowed the SRA cults to flourish, people's repression of the issues, victims repression of their memories, and the leaders repression of the truth, which got bottled up in their scraggly old bodies and turned into cancer, for all to see, and understand. It's not going to stop until you wise up, as the film's spontaneous musical number points out. End SRA, kill death cults.Freemasons DO run the country, Stanley knows this and it scares him so bad he pisses his pants. But Stanley overcomes his fear and stands up to his Freemason father, who molests him, saying "You can't rape me anymore, daddy, you can't rape me anymore." Powerful, urgent. Call to arms against rape and rape-crime. Freemasons think they can rape any little child they want because they own Fox News. Liberals think they can lick any kid's crotch with a blowtorch just because they own network television. Few movies have the courage to expose the power structure of America, and it's true catalyst, the rape of young boys, and the distribution of them as property. Sexual slavery is as rampant now as it ever has been, sublimated into the mainstream so people can't even notice it. DON'T rape children. End SRA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!!! This movie is terrible ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much talk about this movie, I finally decided to give in and watch it for the first time. With what seemed like a stellar cast of actors I expected the movie to be somewhat enjoyable. I couldn't help but notice the running time for this film was 188 minutes. So, I grabbed a bag of popcorn and made myself comfortable. After about 10 minutes into the film, I thought it was going pretty well. Cruise had some scenes which made me laugh (performing his seduce &amp; destroy seminar). Then it started to happen. At about an hour into the film, I found myself questioning "Where is this movie going?", "What is the purpose/meaning of this film?" It wasn't making any sense to me. I don't normally have a problem understanding films, but this one left me in amaze. I couldn't believe how utterly terrible this movie was. Not giving up I continued to watch the film in belief that it could not get any worse. Well, I was wrong! It started to rain frogs. At that point I actually started to laugh in disbelief of how bad this movie was. Frogs? The movie just throws random non-sense at you and expects you to go with it. They try to make certain scenes dramatic and just fail horribly. I would strongly recommend that you stay away from this film at all costs! I wish I could somehow regain the 3 hours of my life that I completely wasted while watching this movie. I will not try to look for an excuse to like this film, the movie sucked that's all there is to it. Someone could not pay me to watch this movie again ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similarities to Angels In America?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angels in America, I thought, was very similar to the theme of forgiveness in Magnolia. Any thoughts? Acutually it was more of an acceptance in Angels In America was acceptance more of the homosexual population during the 1980's when the AIDS epidemic first hit the US. But you can also argue that it is an "acceptance" theme in Magnolia. What can we forgive?Apparently , I need 5 more lines of text to submit this comment, and seeing how it is now 1:30 AM and I have decided to turn my thinking cap off for the next 9 hours or so, I will just continue writing until i can make up for the text minimum limit.

		<fullReview>The funny thing about this picture is the number of people, especially industry people who came out of the woodwork to hate it. Who cares if the ensemble cast is fantastic? Who cares if the script is riveting and bloody raw with a certain truth? Who cares if it was carefully written and directed by someone with only two features under his belt? The fact is that you either understand this story or you don't. Many of us come from families torn asunder by the bits and pieces of scrap metal sucked into the engines of our childhood and thusly causing a fiery crash of sorts as adults. many of us try to hate parents who phoned in their responsibilities or never bothered to make the call at all. From the perspective of someone in the position to forgive or to ask some sort of forgiveness from friends, family or complete strangers, this film drives one straight down the fairway. There are parts of each of us in the characters portrayed here and they are each at once worthy of both pity and scorn. It seems that the rift this film creates is that those who dislike it, may not have lived within the coincidences it poses. Where as with those of us who did like the film, loved it and saw within it the reflections of our own stories which cause it to be true and painful and as solid as bone.</fullReview>

I hate to think that I am a total Philistine, but if I am, then I am. All of the major actors chewed the scenery to no end. Each one (and there were at least eight) got to do their interpretation of extreme emotional distress. And every one of them did it very well. The film just never quite came together for me, was much too long, and extremely depressing to watch. No single one of these things will kill a film for me, but put them all together and you get, well, a four.

		<fullReview>The movie is good, all the acting is superb (with the exception of Jason Robards) and the direction is excellent. But the movie is needlessly long (there are a lot of scenes that could have been shortened or cut completely), has HUGE leaps of logic (an especially idiotic event at the end almost destroys the movie as a whole) and basically deals with characters who are depressed. Spending 3 hours and 10 minutes with a bunch of depressed people gets a little tiring. Also, the movie offers no new insights to anything it brings up (love, incest, misogyny, drug abuse). It's watchable but way too long and what is the point? the director's previous effort "Boogie Nights" was much more cohesive and better. Rent that one--skip this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnolia, an interconnected film to say the least. I'm not gonna offer my own opinion, just the objective truth:1. CREATIVITY LIKE NEVER BEFORE: The first segment of the film before we get into the characters lives is so gripping and creative and well filmed that it sucks you right in! Anderson's stories and camera play are also excellent and divergent. Thumbs up to Anderson for his daring and originality!2. AMAZING CHARACTERS: Congratulations to Anderson and his entire cast for producing some really convincing characters, that are real and interesting to watch.3. TOO MANY OBSCURETIES THAT WERE AT THE HEART OF THE MOVIE. This is a quote from Anderson: "F@&amp;# it, I'm making a three-hour movie about everything I want to make a movie about, and it's going to have Ammie Mann songs in it". In order to understand this film you have to go look up bible passages in exodus, and listen to Ammie Mann's songs and untangle her lyrics. If you're well versed in these areas than this movie will probably make a lot of sense to you, but not having that knowledge leaves you totally disconnected from the film. A good film should be able to ride on its' own accolades and not borrow so heavily off other peripheral material. WITHOUT THIS OTHER INFORMATION THE FILM DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A POINT OR MESSAGE! AND ONCE YOU DISCOVER THIS OTHER INFO THE THEME OF THE MOVIE IS THAT THEIR LIVES ARE A PLAGUE OUT OF THE BIBLE! Anderson is way too pretentious to expect his viewers to buy into it.4. THE TITLE OF THIS MOVIE ISN'T REALLY MAGNOLIA IT'S ACTUALLY: ANDERSON'S CINEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE SONGS OF AMMIE MANN. (I'm not joking, he wrote the screenplay in and around Mann's song "wake up") P.T. Anderson took the wrong direction by making a film that is an interpretation of Ammie Mann's songs. I don't know about most movie goers but I can't watch a film's visual intricacies, and listen to important dialogue while untangling 10 interconnected stories and analyze Ammie Mann's songs all simultaneously!5. THREE HOURS IS TOO LONG: Generally I'm an enthusiastic movie goer who has patience for anything (even blade runner) but after 2 1/2 hours I'm starting to ache really badly. If you bring a pillow to the movie you'll probably do way better than I did.6. MOVIES NEED A CLIMAX: One could say that the "plague" of frogs was the climax of the film, but I felt that all the characters singing simultaneously was more climactic. The point is that there should be a defined climatic moment, a point to which the entire film has been building, and that time never really came clearly into focus.Overall: Anderson is getting ahead of himself and employing too much creative juice and not enough coherence to make the film really solid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overlong, overblown, overrated piece of shift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched some bad movies in my day, but this had to be one of the worst. Why? Well, firstly, I had (I won't call them 'high' because, after all, it was listed on IMDb.com's top 250 movies list) better than average expectations for this one. Secondly, it was long (boy was it long), loud (there were so many parts in which I couldn't hear the dialogue for the soundtrack), and depressing - while I've come to expect this from a lot of movies that come out of Hollywood, this one really emphasized the cultural divide between Left coast people (who are apparently absent any recognizable family values) and the rest of us. At this moment, I can recall only a couple of characters worth rooting for, the rest can all go to Hell (and who'd miss them?); most are pathetic, shallow creatures that can't cope with life, so they wallow in their own self pity. Naturally, its plot is rife with drug and alcohol abuse AND dysfunctional families (though, surprisingly, there is a paucity of racism and homosexuality exhibited when compared to Hollywood's norm).It's a movie that starts out with so much promise ? the premise put forth at its beginning is intriguing ? before the background music (which quickly becomes an unwelcome character of its own) asserts itself. The cast is more than capable (per their resumes) and even its least skilled member (Tom Cruise) delivers an amusing caricature before he disintegrates into a whimpering wuss (I guess it was the requisite crying scene that earned him a supporting nod - usually reserved for actors ? from the Academy). But there is no story here (so, of course, its original screenplay also earned an Oscar nomination) or, at least, what there is devolves into character sketches of people no one should care about (save two, maybe). While admittedly everyone has flaws, Hollywood's disconnected values system always seems to recycle the same old themes: the concept of marriage fidelity is archaic and medicating one's insecurities by snorting coke or imbibing booze to 'escape' their situations is what normal people do.To top things off, producer-director-screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson obviously couldn't figure out how to finish his bloated 'narrative', so he invented an improbable event of biblical proportions (frogs falling from the air, are you kidding me) to end it. Then, after slapping on some preachy and pretentious voice-overs, he was done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as bad as Boogie Nights is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not often that I've been able to say that a director has made one of the best and one of the worst films of the last ten years. After watching three hours of Magnolia, I think I can safely say P.T. Anderson has achieved that distinction.Despite having much of the same cast, and shooting in many of the same locations, Magnolia is a ponderous bore. It lacks even a fraction of the energy and interesting characters of Boogie Nights. After a promising opening narrated by Ricky Jay, the film introduces us to about a dozen characters who proceed to bore each other and the audience along with them. The film suffers from too many needless scenes, and way too much needless dialog. You get the feeling that we could have had a masterpiece here, but the final product is too bloated and the fragments of the story never come together coherently.What went wrong here? Well, the first thing this film could have used was a few more sessions in the editing room. At 188 minutes, there are just too many scenes we did not need to see. And some characters are not even fully developed. I shudder to think how long Anderson's original finished cut was. A re-write or two could have sharpened it up, as well. At least two of the main characters could have hit the cutting room floor and the final product wouldn't have lost anything major. The film had some fine music by Aimee Mann, but Anderson's use of music is not nearly as polished and clever as his previous masterpiece.In spite of this film's high rating, there is a reason it came in some 15 million dollars below its budget at the box office. This film is BAD. I would urge any of you out there who might consider viewing it to run in the opposite direction. Let the art house crowd ponder its deeper meanings or the genius of its design. If you want to be entertained by P.T. Anderson, then take another look at Boogie Nights. Leave Magnolia to gather dust on the shelf at your local video store. This is certainly the worst film I've been introduced to this year.Oh, and one last thing... Jimmy and Claudia GATOR??? GATOR??? Maybe I'm just not intelligent enough to see the deeper meaning of that last name. But I doubt it. Sounds really, really stupid. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

There is no doubt in my mind, that this is up with the worst three films I have ever seen - I could not find one redeeming feature in its entire endless 188 minutes. I could not get into it in any way, and while well aware Tom Cruise was nominated as a best supporting actor for the Oscars - I felt it was done as a joke. His lines were sub-standard and the over-acting of many of the huge cast had to be seen to be believed. The whole thing was a misery, with Jason Robards making everything even more unbearable.

		<fullReview>I may surprise you by proclaiming the absurdity of this movie in view of the praise it has received by the (apparently) erudite prior reviewers, BUT, after watching about 30 minutes of it, I WANT MY 30 MINUTES BACK!!! The disconnected plot (to be kind) elements left me wondering if we had just rented a DEFECTIVE DVD. The excessive foul language made me wonder if the director simply wanted to SHOCK the audience sufficiently to make them DISREGARD the total absence of MEANING.This movie reminded me of RAP MUSIC: LOUD, ANNOYING, SENSELESS.To be fair, I stopped watching Magnolia at the point where Tom Cruise's character conducts a seminar for men who apparently have paid to learn how to manipulate women into having sex with them. This isn't the "eHarmony" type of relationship men and women might find mutually rewarding. This is the "women as sex objects - men as sexual predators" type of abusive relationships that are difficult to rationalize in a movie that defies rationalization. Maybe I was expecting a movie like The Illusionist or Match Point. I may not analyze DNA for a living, but I can tell the difference between a waste of time and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest directors of all time. I personally, deeply enjoy all of his films including the Master despite it being so opaque. I do not however, like Magnolia, there are things I really like about it, I especially liked maybe the first third of it. The rest however, I can't, I just can't, it's just not for me. The movie is very well made, funny, intelligent, excellent music but...this movie is very, very, melodramatic. I suppose its depressing but it isn't in itself made to be a painfully depressing film, such as say "Biutiful"(I CAN"T). However, it is very straining and tiring, for me at least, after seeing 4 consecutive persons crying in a single scene with the music that the film has, I no longer react sympathetically towards each character's current predicament. I get upset, I get very upset, I want to throw things and the film builds up to that moment in such a nail clawing chalkboard kinda way. So...good movie...I suppose, but this is very different from all of Anderson's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often see movies for the first time that leave me wondering "WTF"? And I sometimes wonder if it is me or the film itself. For this reason I often view the movie again, and sometimes again, to determine if I did not get it, or there is nothing to get. Magnolia is one of those movies.After three viewings and much thought, I've finally reached the conclusion that despite all the talent involved and the money spent to make the movie,it is nothing more than a piece of garbage created by a sick mind, for sick people, which serves no real purpose, to include the purpose of entertainment. There is no excitement, no revelations, no redeeming social value, etc. The biggest "draw" for this movie is to try to figure out "what moron envisioned this, or that scene", "why the idiot did not really tie anything together, was unable to actually develop the characters, or actually say anything." While the movie may well "represent" the miscreant's who make movies (those in front of and behind the camera)it does nothing else, goes nowhere, says nothing, is not entertaining and is 100% boring 90% of the time, and only 95% boring the other 10%. The attempt to spice it up with an extensive amount of profanity didn't help at all. It is a sick movie, by sick people, for sick people, and one can only be thankful that it lost a lot of money and the morons will not make another like it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting movie with a very gripping beginning and awesome ending but not much in between.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I'm surprised, this movie started out great, it had a flashy attention grabbing beginning that really draws you in, but halfway through the movie I was wondering when it was going to end. I thought the premise of the movie was very misleading, The beginning scenes really seem quite disconnected from the rest of the movie. The beginning had shock value and mystery but after that the movie turns an entirely different direction. The movie was really about human emotion, tragedy, hardship and moving on. The movie is about people and their relationships and how they are all connected in some way. Each person has an effect on the lives of the people around them. What effects one person will eventually effect another, these are the messages of the film that are constantly repeated as the film progresses. On a whole the message, style and the film it's self was really quite good but I still found myself bored and tired when the film still had an hour and a half to go. The film had a few fundamental flaws that kept it from being the film it was intended to be. First of all it was too long, I do not have a short attention span and I can sit through many three hour epics but for the kind of film this is it was just too long. It is an emotionally heavy film and three hours of the same emotional extremes and messages can get very tedious. Another flaw in the film was how the style changed. The beginning and ending of the film were distinctly different in style from the middle. I felt like I wash watching "Crash" sandwiched in-between a bit of "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (Both good movies by the way). As soon as the intro ended and the narration stopped the film switched gears. It wasn't a concise fact based account on events like the intro, the film did a 360. Basically to conclude I think that the the film could have been better if it the beginning and end followed the style of the rest of the film. Also it could have been better if the film had of been shortened because after an hour everything started looking pretty similar. I got the message in the first hour I didn't need two more.

		<shortDescription>one question in the middle such connections in a movie which defies convention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off all I don't like too long movies and to be honest I hesitated to watch "Magnolia" which defies convention openly.(188 minutes)There have been a couple of overly-long movies which I couldn't watch until the end but I really watched Magnolia with a gusto! I am glad to see a movie in a style quite far from what's currently common in mainstream Hollywood films. Nine separate people whose lives are interconnected in a peculiar interaction! Every one of us may have a great regret in our lives. You know something we did in our rash,fickle times. When we get wise up we cannot really figure out why we did it,what we were thinking really,how we did it but then and there every one of us make similar mistakes. (Both Jimmy and Linda make admissions of infidelity). There are also many us who feel unappreciated by their loved-ones at least for once in their past.People want their kids to be best at school,they want their kids to be best players, to be best performers etc..but somehow most parents do not know where love fits in a competitive world.(Both Donnie and Phil are "quiz kids" who feel unappreciated by their parents though Stanley was quick enough to rescue his identity from such a world). There are many people who feel ostracized by their surroundings always and they just cannot know where to fit in a social environment and it is a hard fact that not many care for them(both Stanley and Jim feel like outcasts, Stanley from his teammates and Jim from his co-workers. There are many more connections about real life in this movie but what really makes the movie a success in my eyes is that it is able to reflect all of these connections just in one movie. But I guess when we are going through a series of experiences many of us turn our face to the concept of "God". While the movie makes us think on "regret" it barely reminds us the concept of divine repentance then this question arises in my mind if you do not see "regret" in a sense of divinity why do you carry the ending of the movie to a biblical portion?(At the end of the movie, an unlikely event occurs: frogs rain from the sky. While the plague of frogs is unexpected,there have been real-life reports of frogs being sucked into waterspouts and raining to the ground miles inland)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a plot I'd give it an 8 but the acting and dialog and meaning and thought provoking material makes me give it a 10 10 10. I read reviews before watching it and had pretty low expectations all around. I found so much in this film unlike the so called- good critics who disliked or hated it. People who crap on this film simply have not thought about it enough while watching it and after; or else they have never encountered people and personalities that remind and can directly or indirectly connect to this films meaning. So the people who hate it simply just missed out on the meaning/s. Sure the characters aren't necessarily completely relatable or lovable, but it's that emotional intrigue and thoroughly thought-out meaning that these characters and story instill. SN- (Many movies I love deal with characters I don't relate to or sometimes even like). So get out of your little comfort zone and pay attention and think. LOVE= nothing unless one has been to the brink of an edge that makes them recognize it. The RELATIONSHIPS are incredibly entertaining because it makes me think so deeply about what they say and who they are saying it about (it has quite a universal meaning and message). FORGIVENESS and REGRET in it's most raw deep form (like it's portrayed in Magnolia) is something 95% of people in the world (I should say America) will never ever feel. And that's a good thing but this movie makes you really come close to that feeling that is quite so interesting and real. "Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie." BTW you tell me one artsy film that's great that you love dearly. Don't say things just because you want to sound intellectual.Magnolia is a rare gem in which I have barely ever got to think so much about a film and its meaning. Self indulgent, It really occurs to me people just can't get past the fact that PT Anderson did really lay a heavy load on viewers (but it's people like the reviewer I quoted that wouldn't get this movie for the two reasons I stated before in my ramble) By the way this review is part ramble not Magnolia. It's also executed perfect in every aspect. So there is much, actually A lot that people could credit for loving this movie. It's a shame many people miss out on this films meaning and thoughtfulness.</fullReview>

The camera swooshes, pans and sways, while the actors joyfully devour the scenery around them. Your can't help but be carried away by it all. The film does have it's glaring flaws. Julianne Moore's performance stays at fever pitch for so long that it wears on your nerves. Melora Walters' scene where she tries to pass off some Amy Mann lyrics as dialog were cringe inducing. And the scene were everyone sings brought the movie to a screeching halt. File that one under, "Gee, it seemed like a good idea at the time". And finally, the frogs. So many mentions and disapprovals about frogs. Personally, I though that the frogs brought a nice cathartic touch to the entire story and underscored the point Anderson was trying to make. What else would you expect from a movie as heedless as this one.This is not a film for the timid. Apologists for assembly line mainstream tripe need not apply. I can best describe this film as: audacious, bold, unapologetic in it's sincerity, unabashed in it's emotion, flawed in it's execution, and ultimately (and most importantly) oh-so watchable. You may not agree with all of it, and may not even like it, but just try and look away. I recommend it, but at the same time, you have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown and over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't be bothered writing a lot about this film; it is SO long that I prefer to keep this short: it is an overblown, predictable potboiler of a movie...derivative (especially of Robert Altman, who would have done a far better job of it) and facile. When I say facile, I am not talking about the "complexity" of the technique used... so many different characters and stories will automatically be "complex". No, I mean that except for the five minutes at the beginning, which were intriguing, he takes far too long to go...pretty much nowhere. The best and only good thing I will say about this is that a few of the performances were worth watching - for about 5 minutes each. If this had been condensed into MAXIMUM 120 minutes it might have been acceptable. As it is, it is HIGHLY over-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnolia" is pretentious. It's understandable why so many people seem to loathe it. It is a film that demands split praise - for every person who loves it, there is another who hates it.It helps to know P.T. Anderson. This is not his best film, it is merely his most popular. "Boogie Nights," for example, is more effective. But because this deals with everyday themes, and is an amalgamation of day-to-day ideals, it received more attention from audiences. That Tom Cruise's wide-toothed grin was boasted on all the ads might have also had something to do with this.Cruise took on the film because it paralleled his own life. He visited his father's deathbed after a falling out, and the script "spoke to him." Very well. Unfortunately, whether or not the film "relates" to him doesn't change the fact that he's just playing the same role he's always played: Himself. He may be a sex guru in this film, but it's still Tom Cruise.The real talents are those who are subtler and more restrained. William H. Macy plays a gay man named Donnie, and his entire performance is concealed within few physical gestures. He sits in the bar all night lusting after the bartender, too afraid to speak to him. It's a really touching performance, and without saying much at all, Macy makes you care for him.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Phil Parma, who is given the task of tracking down the son of a dying millionaire. His performance is very good as well.And perhaps the best of them all belongs to John C. Reilly, the underrated character actor whose performance as a police officer really brings a lot of life to the project.Many of these actors have worked with P.T. before and their familiarity shines through. Macy, Moore, Hoffman and Reilly are all comfortable. The film is at its best when it focuses on all their plights at a distance, and let's us evaluate each character on our own.People say P.T. Anderson is a unique talent, and some of this is true, but those who claim "Magnolia" was an attempt to bash repetitive films are wrong. P.T., like many directors, pays reference and homage to his heroes. There were numerous Scorsese moments in "Boogie Nights" and here there seems to be quite a bit of Kubrick. The scene with the dying man in bed, when the camera takes on an angle from above, is identical to a scene from "2001." Is "Magnolia" pretentious? Yes. Is it the best P.T. Anderson film? Not in my opinion, no. It seems this is P.T.'s most commercial film and its success at the box office and on home video seems to confirm this. As a result, many P.T. fans like myself will find "Magnolia" somewhat of a "sell out" compared to, say, "Hard Eight," "Boogie Nights" or his 2002 project "Punch-Drunk Love." It's still a great picture, a sprawling epic that it perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good. Overall, it's an excellent movie that demands the viewer to participate rather than fixate. That's a rarity in any film these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people will like this, some won't. I heard good things about it, so I picked it out to watch with my parents. The movie has no plot. It makes no sense, and has virtually no ending. It stops, but doesn't really end. The 'f' word is used constantly throughout. The "story" jumps from character to character and scene to scene, but it's a jumble. Few characters have anything to do with any others. The movie is also extremely long, and much could have been cut without affecting the story, since there is no story. This is basically just a day in the life of a bunch of average people, mean people, and general losers. I wouldn't watch this movie again if someone paid me. My parents hated it. We kept thinking all the loose story ends were going to come together in the end and that it would make sense somehow, but it didn't. This was a complete waste of time and money and has made me that much more wary of movies in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aimee Mann is superb in her lyrics and the movie encapsulates so much of our f)(*ed up lives in such a short time. what is good and bad in us is demonstrated here. and don't forget the frogs! I really miss Jason Robarts and how he pulled off this role "of a life time". He always demanded respect and the relationship between him and his daughter is filled with tension, as well as with his son. the anger is potent and any who experienced similar events in their lives will feel it's potency. I love the sound track and how it brings back so many feelings. the game show and the pressure that adults put upon their children, please... and the sex sex sex. cheating and the excuses/excused. this movie really emphasized the impact we have on each other, whether we intend it or not!</fullReview>
