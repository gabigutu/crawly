		<shortDescription>Better than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from watching it tonight, let me tell you, the first big surprise was how how many people turned out for it, for a Thursday night the place was packed as if Harry Potter had just come out, it's been a while since my local theatre was like that.Now to the movie itself. I liked the first one but this one was an improvement. Mostly because of Scott Speedman's character Michael. The last movie only gave us a glimpse into what he has become, and here we get to see him kick butt alongside Selene as what is pretty much an equal. Watching him fight and take-down werewolves was great.The action scenes were bigger, with great direction and camera-work. the special effects are also great, especially the scene with their winged-nemesis pursuing their truck. Make-up is amazingly well done. It was refreshing to see that the werewolves were still practical make-up creations rather than CG.There was also the added bonus of sex scenes. one where a guy is having fun with a couple chick vampires, and one between the two leads. we get to see most of Beckinsale's lovely figure (MILF is an understatement) but no direct frontal shots. ladies will enjoy much shirtless Speedman action.The opening segment makes it worth a look, i definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the first or thought it had promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will satisfy its target audience, guaranteed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it. If you're going to see this movie, you probably enjoyed the original and are looking for more. You want high doses of fight scenes, vampire and lycan lore, blood, violence, and Kate Beckinsale wearing leather or less. In short, this movie delivers all of the above in great excess, so if you liked Underworld, you're going to like Underworld: Evolution as much or more.On the other hand, if you don't like blood, violence, action, mythology, or using a sword in a world full of guns, this movie is not for you, and it's NOT MEANT to be for you, so don't complain about it.This movie surpasses the original as far as story development. We learn a good bit about each character's past, which helps justify all the extreme violence they engage themselves in. We're also introduced to some new characters and plot lines that add interest and new twists, rather than just rehashing all the familiar faces from Underworld.This movie fails to get a 10 rating from me for the following reasons:1) Not quite enough "stuff" to fill the time. Too many shots of Kate Beckinsale "looking intense". The movie could have been 10 minutes shorter if the number of these shots had been reduced from seemingly infinite down to 10 or so. Minor problem.2) A few glaring continuity errors.3) Too many flashback/explanation shots from the original Underworld. I suppose this is necessary so as not to alienate viewers who didn't see the original or who forgot it. However, this movie is obviously targeted to people who liked the original and want more, so give us a quick refresher and then hit us with new stuff. No need to keep providing Cliff's notes throughout the movie. Make us think a little!4) There wasn't a standout power move comparable to the spinning/shooting through the floor in the original Underworld. Let's face it, half the people that went to that movie did so because that shot was in the trailer. This movie had lots of power moves, but none that stood out as the winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb sequel for fans - others should avoid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution is a film for fans of the genre - if you like it, prepare for two hours of undiluted pleasure or, if not, then I suppose all the epithets along the lines of 'boring, derivative, banal, underwhelming tosh' are fully justified. Read on: if you are put off by the description that follows, maybe this film is not for you and I've done my job. If you enjoyed the first film in the series, or (as one of the uninitiated) these tantalising glimpses of high-tech goth makes it appeal, then read on - for the more you know about the mythology first the better (since the film itself wastes little time explaining itself).Underworld is a dark domain where age-old enmity between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) is played out with terrifying fury. Normal people are fairly peripheral to the plot (vampires have emergency blood transfusion type supplies to save the need to attack humans). Both sides are armed not only with traditional blood-sucking and flesh-tearing fang-capacity, but with all the gadgetry of customised guns and other scientific paraphernalia with which to track and kill each other. Here is no disneyfied world of a timid picture-book 'Dracula' hidden in a battered old coffin somewhere - these guys exult in state-of-the-art locking crypts, massive stone fortresses, and raids conducted with military precision. The film unashamedly boasts an adults-only certificate and has consummate amounts of nastiness, gore, head-ripping and scary battles as well as realistic dollops of sex.Apart from the actual mechanics (such as reaction to sunlight, ways of causing death), the vampires of Underworld have little in common with their namesake in literature - a fascinating creature that slowly saps its victim of strength. Several other fables are instead interwoven, perhaps the most obvious being a Romeo and Juliet type love affair between the beautiful Selene (Vampire heroine, played by Kate Beckinsale) and Michael, the Lycan hybrid. There is also a Beauty and the Beast charm since both these characters display very human qualities at times, such as their tenderness towards each other and the desire to minimise suffering. We long for them to rise above the terrible disease that pumps in their veins. There is a 'Mad Scientist' type underlay with the development of specialised weaponry and the search for the pure strain (giving rise to Matrix-style battles) and, last but not least, Underworld borrows from the X-Men idea of mutations and stylistically from more polished films of a not dissimilar ilk such The Crow or Blade.The name Selene means the moon goddess, who was known for her countless love affairs and also her purity. Her sister was Eos, the dawn. Michael is a Hebrew word meaning 'he who is like God'. But we're hardly interested in the psychology of plot structure and name-conundrums at this point, are we? The thrill comes from watching Beckinsale (Selene) in a leather catsuit kick ass all the way to the nemesis, or seeing the potentially very scary (and equally photogenic) Scott Speedman (Michael) show his gentle side as he gets her kit off, or actors of the calibre of Derek Jacobi and Bill Nighy play really cruel, vicious, malevolent creatures that haven't been toned down for the under-18yr-olds, or the inventive and bloody battles in fabulously Gothic settings. There's lashings of blood every few seconds; sex mixed with blood for the pervy; and tasteful, delicate sex to remind us we're watching something artistic and not downright depraved (even if we are). If anything, Underworld: Evolution delivers in spades what the first film only hinted at, yet keeping some of the best elements (Beckinsale's acrobatics, car chases and great sets) that set the original tone.The plot is far from simplistic, so here's a reminder of what you need to absorb in the first few minutes in case you miss it or forget to take notes: Vampire heroine Selene (Kate Backinsale), after dedicating most of her life to exterminate Lycans (who she believes slaughtered her family when she was a child), discovers she has been betrayed by her own kind. She teams up with Michael, a Vampire/Lycan hybrid (a human who has become infected with both viral strains). While on the run with her, Michael has to struggle to accept and understand his powers, and he longs to end the war between Lycans and Vampires.Other important characters include: Viktor (Bill Nighy) - a haughty, ostentatious vampire overlord with a very dark side (Selene awoke him prematurely from a long sleep to tell him of a Lycan offensive).Marcus - the last surviving Vampire Elder, a Medieval Warlord. Mutated into a vampire from the bite of a bat. Felt compelled to raise Vampire warriors (such as Viktor) to control the Lycan horde. As he was awoken by the blood of a Lycan scientist ('Singe') however, Marcus has become one of a terrifying new breed.William, brother of Marcus. He mutated into a werewolf (Lycan) from a wolf bite and thence populated the region with the violent Lycan beasts.Alexander Corvinus (Derek Jacobi) is the first immortal, the genetic father of both Lycan and Vampire. The pestilence of the Great Plague of Europe had mutated within him to become the Mother Virus, which eventually became two separate diseases (Vampire and Lycan), as it was passed on to his sons Marcus and William.The film traces the evolution of these characters but you do need to concentrate to get the significance of the heavy battles that are heaped one upon each other. The real question is, what will happen to Selene and Michael? The ending packs an emotional punch and paves the way for even more spectacular (and hopefully bigger budget) episodes. Stay to the end of the credits for some great heavy metal music.Underworld: Evolution offers escapism that explores dark lusts, power, overweening ambition, blind dedication, and the purity of vision to surpass these. Just don't expect Shakespeare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning to end, my eyes didn't stray from the screen. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in the theater that I was so transfixed by.A number of great performances from polished actors complimented some truly spectacular action scenes and plot developments and twists.The title alone says exactly what the film accomplishes, as the story 'evolves' seemingly by the minute, and it never becomes stale or overtly contrived.I found myself able to predict certain parts of the film, and even still in those instances, the events that unfolded shortly thereafter kept me from feeling disappointed in the very fact that I was almost certain of what was coming.If the standard notion amongst avid movie buffs is that sequels rarely, if ever best their predecessor, 'Underworld: Evolution' defies that notion through and through. Much like 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' was able to take a solid foundation from its predecessor and take it to a level where it became the standard for sci-fi/action films at the time of its release, U:E should become the blue-print for all werewolf and/or vampire action/dramas to come, or creature-related action/dramas in general, for that matter.The pacing was very good, the dialogue was at times great, overall very fitting (and never poor), all questions a viewer could have possibly coming into the film are addressed and sufficiently answered, and some of the subtleties of the film, such as the appropriate use of brief flashbacks, kept the film from ever becoming confusing or difficult to follow, which I felt happened on occasion in the first film the first time I saw it.Kate Beckinsale delivers a performance that shows she is a very versatile actress who just so happens to be strikingly beautiful, and Scott Speedman was more than just a little eye-candy for the ladies, delivering a performance that made me believe he was the perfect Michael Corvin far more than the first film. And the supporting cast around the two main stars were all equally up to the task, with many turning in performances that are likely to be career defining.Hats off to Len Wiseman for living up to a last name that couldn't be more fitting. He never compromises his vision, and more importantly the story by trying to woo the crowd with over-the-top (Matrix-y) action scenes or gratuitous sexual imagery, as many directors do to try to win over their audiences, and yet the movie has some of the best action scenes the genre has seen in years, and a sexual chemistry between Selene and Michael that is very believable, and yet not over-done. Even in one very intimate scene between them, it is never excessive or tasteless.I will likely go see this film in theaters again before it is out, and the only film I've ever seen in theaters twice was 'Batman' when I was 10 years old and the second viewing was for a birthday of a friend of mine at the time. I will also certainly be buying the DVD when it is released in an effort to support film-making at its finest. For anyone who liked the first film, you will most likely love this one as I did (do), and for anyone on the fence, you will likely find yourself joining us fans in rejoicing over this highly anticipated sequel. As for doubters of the first film, just give it a chance and you'll likely find that whatever your gripe was with the 'Underworld', 'Underworld: Evolution' does not suffer from the kinds of flaws you may have found the original to have had.b/c I can only vote using IMDb's scoring system with whole numbers I am giving it a 10, but on a scale of 1 to 10 including halves, with 10 being the best, I give it a 9.5/10, whereas I give the first an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable But Not Too Good Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, let me say that I'm a very big fan of the original. I think it did everything right; having a nice Gothic overtone, great characters, an original, intriguing and in-depth plot, fun action and an overall script that never once felt dull. Oh, and of course...it had Kate Beckinsale in tight leather, hehehe. Now does this sequel contain all these qualities that made the original so good? Personally, I'd have to say no, I don't think it did. Was the movie necessarily bad? Also no. It was highly entertaining but not that good of a movie overall.STORYLINE: The story in this film was no where near as good or developed as the original. As it starts off with a war scene in the past, I found myself really enjoying it. We find out a little about the Corvinus family and the origins or Marcus, who was the very first vampire, and his brother, who was the very first Lycan. But after we witness these scenes and learn these few minor plot details, the story development pretty much comes to a dead stop. Honestly, nothing really happens in this movie. It's all just action and really nothing more.CHARACTERS: The lead characters were good. Selene and Michael didn't exactly have any development but that's okay because they were developed enough in the first film. But what was slightly developed was their romance, which the first film seemed to be lacking. We really got to feel the connection between them and how much they really cared for each other. And it was great to see Michael show off his new hybrid abilities and kick some booty along the way. He was a lot cooler in this film than in the original. The new vampire leader, Marcus, was also pretty damn cool. He had a very sinister appearance, especially with the devil-like wings, and didn't seem to have any sympathy at all as he brutally disposed of anyone who got in his way. In the original, we had Lucian, who was a well developed bad-guy character and I actually found myself caring for him. Marcus, on the other hand, didn't strike a cord with me at all. He looked cool, sure, but besides that, he had absolutely nothing going for him and I really didn't care what happened to him. All the other characters in this film were also very undeveloped as well. We really knew nothing of them and as a result, felt unsure whether we should like them or hate them. So that's a major issue.ACTION: The action, most the time, was very enjoyable. And I stress MOST of the time, not ALL of the time. There was some really fun action and fight sequences and a nice amount of blood and gore thrown into the mix. So it definitely does manage to entertain the action buffs. But then, at times, the action began to feel annoying as it got extremely repetitive. It was like they just kept replaying the same action scene over and over and just tweaked it a little in order to pass it off as a different scene. This was a problem because the whole movie seemed to base itself on action, rather than story, and the action wasn't even all that good.ATMOSPHERE: Another good thing about this movie would have to be the scenery. Yeah, I know that's not really important in the movie, but it really did help with the overall experience. There were beautiful mountain landscapes, snowy woods, old style castles in ruins and gorgeous red colored twilight skies. So I think it actually helped a lot in setting the atmosphere and gets points for great eye candy.OVERALL: The first film was an action-horror movie with a great original storyline. This sequel, on the other hand, felt more like a series of left over action scenes that were taken out of the first film. I think watching the two films back to back will make a great overall experience. But as a stand-alone, it doesn't quite work. It's fun for sure, but that's about it. It's not even remotely close to being as good or better than the original in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment for a fan of the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the first movie, this was a absolute and utter disappointment. I was skeptical when I first heard about a sequel, and now it seems that when Kevin Grevioux disappeared from the project without any form of explanation, so went all the chances it had of being good. I truly wanted to enjoy this movie, and envy those who can, but there were just too many faults here for me to look past. The plot is first of all much too rushed, and if you haven't watched the first movie, it is hard to grasp, despite all the flash backs, that are quite clumsily conveyed here. The characterization of Selene takes a 180 degree turn, and not for the better. When she in the first movie was portrayed as a cold and efficient warrior, she here seems more like a female version of Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs. She is also in the true spirit of the awful Mummy Returns revealed to have a past with the vampire world as a human, as well as much more powerful as a vampire than we were first led on to believe. This was a development that quite efficiently killed all hat was good or interesting with her character, and the ending when she is turned into some sort of super vampire that can match a hybrid and stand in sunlight, drives the final nail in the coffin.She also has zero chemistry with Speedman's character, who's most interesting lines are "Jesus Christ", and obviously have no bigger role than to serve as her object of rescue and the second part in one of the most anatomically incorrect and random sex scenes I've ever seen.The movie is all in all too much full of contradictions and suffering from a faulty script to be even remotely interesting. A grand example is how Markus, the other hybrid, gains Selene's memories when drinking her blood. Speedman's character also does that, but yet, we see no sign of him experiencing the same. Or, how it is explained that Markus, the first vampire, becomes a hybrid simply by drinking lycan blood since he is a Corvinous. Should not his brother William, the first lycan, then also have become a hybrid when killing and eating vampires (as it looks like he did plentiful)? Or my favorite, when Michael turns out to be wanted by the police as a dangerous criminal, despite that he to my recollection did absolutely nothing that would warrant that in the first movie, as well that while Selene cannot take being stabbed in the shoulder without passing out (first movie), a shot in the gut only makes her angry.I also find it quite irritating that up until the release, there were many things speaking for a return or at least small featuring of Michael Sheen's character Lucian, who also was a favorite for many; to have it all ending with what seems like a double in a body bag. The actor's state as the lead's (Beckinsale) ex, who is now also married to Wiseman, offers a rather discouraging explanation for this. The violence is gory and unnecessary, the action scenes badly filmed and confusing and the gracious nudity just tasteless. Wiseman has some incredible talent with making movies look good, but he should in my opinion keep away from the script and contract Grevioux again for the next movie, if there is one, and see if he can salvage what is left from this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darned good Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a sequel this good since Terminator 2! They really went back in history to give so much more storyline, or just added to the original story in such a clever way. They also did a great job in out-doing the killings from part1! I was so intrigued by this movie I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first twenty minutes :) . The director did a great job of bringing you into his "underworld". Every part of the story line was pleasantly unexpected. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part of this story anymore. It isn't mostly centered on love like the first one, however it is all there, from love, to the long history, to time jumping. I wouldn't recommend watching this if you haven't seen part 1! But I would recommend watching the whole series! Very Awesome. Cant wait to see part 3 if they make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was extremely LAME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was lame and very laughable. I went to see it with a bunch of my friends, all of who are fans of the original one. There are so many reasons that this movie sucked that I forget more than half of them. I forget most of the plot holes, inconsistencies to the first movie, and random crap that was randomly put into this movie just to try to give some importance to everything but was too important but some how forgot to be mentioned in the first movie.First of all, the sex scene? That was random, stupid and I almost burst out laughing. Not only was it a random and unneeded scene, used just to make little teenies be like "OOH NAKED!!", but in addition to that...The positioning of their bodys?? Do they really expect us to believe that he's having sex with her?? Well, not unless he's having sex with her bellybutton! Speaking of nudity and sex, the random scene where that guy is piling up the bodies of the nude girls, shown just so they can better show that they have a naked lady in the movie. That scene was also stupid and pointless, again, just to make little teens say "OOH BOOBIES!!" and therefore it's a good movie.Secondly, it was like a big hour and a half long fight scene. Don't get me wrong, I love fight scenes, especially big ones, but the choreography of these fight scenes just sucked.Then there was the bridge, that broke twice in the castle. First she blew up the ceiling, which fell down and broke the bridge. Didn't the bridge break AGAIN when the helicopter came down? Oh and its a good thing that the rope is strong enough to pull down a helicopter and has no quick-release. Oh and also that guy that was next to Selene on the bridge when William came out of the shadows, grabbed the other guy, and shot him...Why the hell did he turn into a werewolf? Werewolfs SHOOT you and suddenly you turn into one?? Let's not forget "Hmm...lets bring my dead-boyfriend's body with us...y'know, just for sentimental reasons...and in case he happens to randomly come back to life he can help us". That was too lame and too predictable. I rolled my eyes when it showed him coming back to life. And then he tore off Williams head...the other time someone tore of a werewolves jaw. O yay, we can tear of heads left and right because it'll be "wicked cool!" I liked how Selene didn't remember the little pendant thing until she pushed the little button thing on it, and a little 1/4-inch little jagged edge came out. You needed that little edge there in order to remember it?? Wow, you have a suck memory.How come the helicopters blades were still spinning after it crashed? That was extremely stupid. And the way she pushed Markus and he just sort of floated back into them. Or was that supposed to be slow motion? Either way it looked lame. And don't you like the way the bridge led PERFECTLY to the helicopters blades, and below the bridge there were supports for it right NEXT to were the helicopter crashed? Wow, they have really good aim not to knock out those supports while crashing.And I like how now just stabbing a werewolf(in front of that exiled guys home) kills them. Y'know, it's easier when you're trapped...just stab them, with probably what was just a stainless steel knife.Oh and there was the EXTREMELY LAME line of Selene: "What will I become??" Old guy: "The future". I almost laughed there as well...seriously, that is one of the lamest lines I've heard. This movie makes me think of an extremely-high-budget B-movie.There are plenty of other reasons but those are the only ones I can remember right now as to the lameness of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Hope Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selene (Kate Beckinsale) wishes to expose the truth about the death of Viktor to the first true vampire Marcus (Tony Curran) that is hibernating. However, Marcus has already awakened and wants to release his savage Lycan brother William (Brian Steele), who has been imprisoned for centuries. When Marcus tries to get the medal possessed by Lucian from the hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman), Selene decides to visit Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), the exiled official historian of the covens, to understand his interest. When Selene and Michael meet Tanis, they disclose the truth about their bloodlines, and later with the support of Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), Selene faces the powerful and evil Marcus as the last hope left for the mankind.It is very difficult to see good sequels, but "Underworld ? Evolution" gave me the sensation that together with "Underworld", they are one good movie split in two parts. The viewers like me that enjoyed "Underworld" will certainly like this sequel very much. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Anjos da Noite ? A Evoluç?o" ("Angels of the Night - The Evolution")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution reviewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can someone write about a movie that has been so well discussed already during the past weeks?! Everything has been said in reviews and fan forums about the plot with Romeo &amp; Juliet resemblances framed by the secret war between vampires and werewolves, about the cast and characters, about the movie's style &amp; atmosphere, action, make-up and CGI effects, camera shots, violence, love scenes &amp; nudity. Underworld Evolution's predecessor was above all underestimated in terms of what potential it had to build up a solid fan base in a genre that throughout movie history like no other has not only drawn people into the theatres but also to conventions, fan clubs, signings and other events. If we go back in time movies which threw together famous film monsters like in "House of Frankenstein", "Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man", later in "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" or in our days "Freddie Vs. Jason", "Van Helsing" and "Aliens Vs Predator" were most likely designed to squeeze the purse of the audience (which in most cases without no doubt they successfully did) but never have withstood the moviegoer's expectations for a long time. "Underworld" (2003) on the other hand, a sleeper during it's theatrical release as treated with neglect promotion wise in many countries has to be admitted that it rightfully gained it's respect through mouth-to-mouth propaganda resulting in DVD sales which soon exceeded the box-office results. The movie built up a very solid fan base, people that keep talking about it even after three years ? creating an under-world (sorry for the pun, I just could not resist) like Star Trek, Star Wars and some other Sci-Fi movies and shows have done before. So it is very possible that for the first time in the horror genre "Underworld" and "Underworld Evolution" really work as 'monster mash' movies.With only some video clips on his reference list it is obvious that "Underworld" was a child of heart of writer / director Len Wiseman (together with writers Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux). Only someone very dedicated and so confident can get such a project of the ground without having directed a single feature length movie before - get it produced, assemble a professional cast. And it paid out - with an estimated budget of 22 mill. it achieved an accumulated worldwide gross of more than 90 mill. US dollars. Plus, it activated a great number of fans which were dying to see more. Because of these fans there is a sequel ? they made it possible by buying the DVDs, watching Underworld in the cinema and kept talking about it, discussing it from the beginning to the end, throwing up questions, inspiring new story lines, etc. When seeing "Underworld Evolution" I believe that Len Wiseman and Danny McBride accurately meet the expectations of their fans in a very respective way. They stand true to the original in style and action and by not getting too pathetic love story wise. The storyline is not dumb and does not just follow the vampires vs. werewolves plot which it could have done. Of course it has some flaws, but nothing which can be not excused. As there is no perfect crime there is also no perfect plot. All stories have flaws ? even the real ones. And if we look behind the almost endless tour-de-action: there is the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who was the lead action heroine in the first movie and now, without loosing any of her screen presence, she leaves enough space for Scott Speedman who now plays a much stronger and more self-confident Michael Corvin. Bill Nighy is always an extreme pleasure to watch and it is amazing how versatile this man is. And of course there is the great Sir Derek Jacobi playing his part so wonderfully understated, yet so present, that it will be a hard task not to bring his character back in a future entry. Conclusion: If you have seen the first "Underworld" movie and liked it, and if you are allowed to "pervasive strong violence and gore, some sexuality/nudity and language" you won't be disappointed. If you don't like horror movies at all ? this one is not likely to change your opinion. When you consider this and buy a ticket you will get an action packed horror movie which can be watched for more than one time for several reasons. But see for yourself ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Underworld: Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Kate Beckinsale's Seline character got around kicking massive rear in slinky black Lycra, we had Charlize Theron doing the same in Aeon Flux, and coming soon, Milla Jovovich in Ultraviolet. Sexy costumes, menacing weapons and killer moves seem to be the order of the day. It's no doubt that Underworld would have a sequel, since it was obviously hinted at after the end credits of the original, though it would be three years before it materialized.And Kate Beckinsale still looked as hot as the pasty-white faced, black and blue eyed vampire known as a Death Dealer. Actually, that's one of the extremely few good things about this movie. We get to see her more, see her in action more (*ahem* love scene some more to keep the fan boys happy) with her twin rapid firing handguns, and flitting around action sequences without tearing her outfit.The other good thing about this movie, is if you're a fan of blood and gore, you'll be kept happy with the many decapitations in various creative ways, piercings, shootings (at point blank), and endless gunfire.Unfortunately, these good points were thin after a while, and seriously, you'll be clock watching for it to end. The movie starts off by going back to the early beginnings of the feud and tries to explain blood ties and brotherly love, in the times when the Death Dealers were wearing hand-me-down armor from the elves in Lord of the Rings. For those who are unfamiliar with the first movie, fret not, this movie does spend some time to try and explain the convoluted plot to you in a series of quick flashbacks. Sometimes so much that I think the entire first movie had been told here in fast forward.And what a convoluted plot it is! Somehow you know that our heroes can't die - one's a superhuman hybrid never seen before, while the other is Seline the invincible who defied all odds to survive past the first film. But invulnerability makes a character weak, as it takes away the fun. Injuries heal in record time (ok, so they're vampires who recuperate in the darkness), and you'll really wonder if the Highlander way is the only way for a character to perish. The central plot about brotherhood, and the quest to unleash the very first Lycan was pretty boring stuff.Somehow the production seemed a little lazy too. In the first movie, we had sets which are more in tuned to the present world, with the city and all. But this movie seemed to like darkness and worn out locations, and even the finale set looked suspiciously similar to the original's. And I learnt too that vampires can transfer abilities and skills by letting another suck its blood, much like Chinese Martial Arts films where the kungfu master imparts his skills to his disciples using internal strength - you'll become stronger overnight.I had great hopes that the sequel would present itself as superior to the original, especially if it could develop a strong back story. However I was proved wrong, and this sequel, like many others, pale when compared to the original. I don't think there'll be another sequel given the characters becoming who they are at the end (almost a copy of X-Men 2's camera moving across a body of water shot with voice over), but then again, you'll never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problems with Underworld:Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film was like bread, y'know edible. This one's just plain crap and half of it makes no sense. Michael dies halfway through and, because he's a hybrid, resurrects himself. If they want to kill him off, just do it and be done. Also Marcus' death could have been much better instead of him just getting chopped up. The same applies to William. How can he die so easily. It's just plain stupid. Lucian was a much better villain, you actually felt for him. If there's going to bea sequel then the producers have got to stop relying on Kate Beckinsdale to sell the film and actually put some substance or at least some decently choreographed fight scenes in there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So very disappointing.Even with the various amounts of eye candy. Scott...delish. Kate... a tall drink of water. But even those lovely accouterments can not save this tragedy called a movie. Lord deliver us from terrible producers who can't recognize good writing and story development even if it hit them with a Mack Truck.Plot what plot. I couldn't even find an outline.U:E picks up right where the 1st one leaves off. Selene is struggling with the weight of the murder of an elder on her shoulders and Michael. However Michael is a weight we know she will carry gladly. However the hot, steamy, sexiness, is not enough to justify seeing this movie. With obvious, pathetic, and cliché plot twists and worse; cliff hangers with no meaning or use; this movie if you can call it that falls flat on its face and then gags its self when its too stupid to realize that you just have to turn over on your back.The back story is unnecessary and quite long winded. The only caveat is the amount of bloodshed. No, I take that back even the amount of blood spilled is not enough to make it better. Fast forward to the present. Marcus is awake and boy is he angry and hungry.Ooh look food in the pretty, pretty, package of Kraven.Alas poor viewers we knew him well. Errr no we didn't.Marcus finds the key to his happiness in the form of blood memories. These memories aid him in his very old, very predictable quest. Which has him on a killing rampage and an eating frenzy. Look at all these walking meals and yeeough he'll eat anything.If we all remember from Underworld the infusion of Lycan blood that woke Marcus in the first place made Marcus into a stronger flying insect/bat/vampire thingie! This flying improvement tries to dominate the movie by being the boogie man. Sadly the only thing he accomplishes is acting like a brat throwing a bloody temper tantrum. Too bad his milkshake is better than yours.Then we learn in inappropriate cut aways and obvious leading that pretty, pretty Michael has the key to things literally. I do mean that. As we are hit in the head with big cement blocks we find out that Selene is the map. What a pretty map.Things all come together when we find out that 'Daddy' has been watching all this time. 'Daddy' cleans up after his children and of course calls on Selene to do what he can not because in the end Victor was right. (Poor Victor he was the only saving grace to this series and damn if they didn't kill him off too early.) Those boys can't be left unattended, they tend to start pesky blood feuds and have ill-used loyalty and hatred tendencies. When loyalty overrides good sense and real monsters are allowed to roam free and unchecked in their little world. Because dang it we want it! and pooh on anyone who disagrees.A dirty, bloody, and pesky business these blood feuds. Onward I digress. With all this 'angst' flying around we have a sadly attended side story of pretty pretty Michael still struggling with the fact that he is no longer human. Too bad the only way to convince him is to kill him over and over and over again. Maybe by the end of the movie our slow pretty pretty may get it. Cause really, he like dies at least 3 times. No really! One time he even tried to kill himself. :sigh: Why are all the pretty ones so slow! Poor Selene! He better be good in the sack because really! Though from what I saw I wasn't sure but a few scenes tell me otherwise after. Now I'm not a porn aficionado but I do know that Tab A should fit in Slot B but from what I can tell vampire/werewolf hybrids do it a bit differently! (and I still wouldn't kick him outta bed cause anybody can be taught!) Now armed with gifts from Daddy Selene sets out to kill. Kill Marcus and everything that would make Marcus happy. Marcus dared to take what was hers and now he must pay. KILL! KILL! KILL! With all Selene's new gifts she still has to get wet. :sigh: The trouble a girl has to go through for a good killing.Over all the fight scenes are lethargic and have no pop or momentum. So even if the only reason to watch the movie was for T and A and some good action. Well you barely get 1 out 2. No the pun was not intended.I was bored and bitterly disappointed. I find a movie a failure if I deem it necessary to check my voice mail during the show. Not to mention do a little jig when I get to drool at Scott just a little bit longer.If I could I would give it a 0!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is made of fast action stuff that the story loses its strength and originality, and you find yourself in an action movie lacking the thrill that was one of the best points of Underworld 1. And the big disaster is the ending, with William out from his prison we expected the movie was warming up, but instead, a fast action scene where Micheal somehow after being dead gets back to life, and beheads William in a couple of minutes. same for the short fight between Selene and Marcus. At that point the movie was sooooo disappointing.I would definitely go for Underworld 1, much better than its sequel especially "Story" wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A b-movie just to please the box-office, have you been fooled too?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could you expect from a movie, which starts with a quote from the horrible Matrix (R)Evolution(S), as the best character of Underworld 1 warns out "It ends tonight"? All that was intriguing, genuine, attractive in the first movie has been thrown out in the garbage can. A movie is essentially a story. A good sequel is a movie where you tell different things in the same way, where moviegoers get the same feelings but in a different way. If you bump off in the first 20 min. all the characters who had survived form part one (Kraven, the blond vampire-woman and all the Covent) that's fair evidence that you think a plot is made by a collection of fight scenes, plus some cheesy nudity and new characters, their only purpose being to be slaughtered. Corvinus and Tanis could bring something interesting in the move, but they are vapid, shallow and lifeless even before they get killed. Actually Corvinus was really not needed, unless it would become a major figure of the movie, not a self-murdering 700 year old loser. A real waste. Not mentioning the flaws of continuity, logic, and lore tradition (this is about how vamp and werewolves can be killed). Common sense is also sorely lacking in the movie, especially when we have been told by many movies how helicopters crash... by the way? why Marcus ? after supposedly having been resurrected many times in the past centuries ? got just now the urge to free his brother? The film is an insult to fans of Underworld and a not recommendable one for those who are not in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you make a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Feel free to dismiss any reviewer that immediately admits to disliking Underworld and then claims that Underworld: Evolution is "just as bad" as the original. Does it really surprise anybody that this is a movie for people who enjoyed the original? Didn't like the first one? Then why subject yourself to a follow-up that you expect to equally loathe? You have no one to blame but yourself if you spend your time or money on it. That being said...This is how you make a sequel! I'll gladly admit it - I'm a fan of Underworld. I own it on DVD. Yes, Kate Beckinsale in leather has a lot to do with it. If she were at the local library decked out in leather and reading from the phone book then I'd gladly pay $8 to attend. But the movie has more going for it than just the hot babe factor. The style, story, and stunts they delivered on a mere $22 million budget are incredibly impressive. It's a true testament to what can be accomplished when fans of a genre make a movie using ideas that are bigger than their bankroll.Thankfully, Underworld: Evolution picks up where the first one leaves off and never bothers to slow down. An inevitable question is how does it compare to the first? I hesitate to say I prefer one over the other. It's akin to trying to choose which Beckinsale pose is the sexiest. How do you choose? Aren't they all essential? From a technical standpoint there's no question that Evolution is better. The CGI is sharper, the animatronic werewolves are bigger and badder, the fight scenes are more intense, and I'm pretty sure Kate's leather is a little tighter. But both movies are equally important to the overall story. Each can be viewed as a necessity in light of the other.What stands out most prominently in Evolution (other than Kate's mere presence) is there's just more to it. Take any expression or adjective that you feel adequately describes the original and add "er" to it. It's gorier. It's bloodier. It's sexier. It's faster. It's action-packeder. OK, so that last one doesn't work, but you get the point. Whether you can tolerate the extra blood and gore is a matter of personal taste, but we're talking werewolves and vampires. Anybody who walks out of the theater claiming, "There was too much blood!" could probably use a good slapping.However, story isn't sacrificed for the sake of juiced up stunts and explosions. The element most essential to Evolution's success is its abundance of back-story which effectively maintains continuity with the first film. Remember Amelia? You haven't forgotten about Viktor and what he did to Selene's family, have you? Gaps are filled and details are expounded upon to give us a couple of nice twists that keep the plot fresh and interesting.That's it. That's all I'm going to say about the movie. Further elaboration is neither necessary nor useful. See it and absorb it all for yourself. I do recommend watching your Underworld DVD beforehand because it'll cut down on some possible confusion. Of course, some of you fanboys probably have the original memorized, rendering a 203rd viewing redundant.Are you already a fan of Underworld? If so then you'll likely view this as a worthy sequel. It's stylish, it's dark, it's atmospheric, and it's still sportin' that sweet hybrid 'tude.Or did you hate the original? If so then do yourself and us a favor and save your money. No one really wants to hear you complain that this is "just as bad." Are you just looking for an excuse to play Billy BadBone on the Internet message boards? No doubt it allows you to put your whining to good use, but can't you find another skill to fine-tune?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, another weekend, another mindless badly written action film crapfest. Granted, I saw the first movie, which I hated, so the odds of my liking the second film were about zero. But nothing could have prepared me for the abomination which I was forced to witness. I think the basic premise is kind of interesting.. vampires versus lycanthropes. The first thing that caught my eye was a rather sensual moment half way through the movie. With scene after scene of senseless gore and the usual 40,000 round clips being emptied into the main characters with little result, you'd think a love scene would be welcomed. Boy was I wrong. This was no love scene... this was flat out monkeysex. Usually the camera stays tastefully above the waist.. not here my friends! You might think this sounds sexy, but it wasn't. You see, they showed naught one bit of the girl, but plenty of man-ass gyrating between two deathly pale vampire legs. Imagine the host of Tales from the Crypt taking a shower... yeah it was about that sexy. And then half way through the movie came my favorite scene of all. The girl tells her lycanthrope friend "drink this blood, otherwise the hunger will strike and you might attack a human without warning". So what does he do? He doesn't drink the blood, and decides to go hang out at the nearby tavern. Well gee, I wonder what's about to happen? When will Hollywood realize that we want heroes that are not complete dips****. Anyhow yeah.. next thing you know hes tossing humans around like rag dolls and running away from a swarm of cops. The rest of the movie consisted of the male lycan having trouble killing the lowliest of werewolves one second and taking on the super-powerful lord of the vampires with ease the next. But that's not all folks, they saved the worst for last. The whole plot of the movie is that the bad vampire is trying to release his SUPER powerful lycanthrope brother from a prison, and the heroes must stop him because this lycanthrope incredible super-villain. Well at the end of the movie the super werewolf is in fact released, and we see it for I don't know about five SECONDS before the hero rips it's head off. Oh yes, you heard me. They didn't even SHOW his fight with the plot-line defining character. They actually just used a quick cut away from the female hero shooting things to show just the part where the beasts head is being torn off. Wow, good thing they went through all that work keeping him from being released. I'd be surprised if that werewolf could have even left the castle without a rascal scooter. I bet he was all white because he was old and tired, not super powerful. They should have taken him to a nursing home and fed him the werewolf version of Ensure. Although I guess if you think about it, the fact that they ripped the head off a poor defenseless old werewolf was the most interesting part of the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Underworld: Evolution (2006) Director: Len Wiseman Cast: Kate Beckingsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Bill Nighy, Derek Jakobi Review: The first Underworld was alright, not great...just alright. But after a while it sort of grew on me. The first time I saw it I thought...man this really isn't what it could have been. And it wasn't. It was missing more action, vampires and fights between the bloodsuckers and the werewolves. Did the sequel succeed in giving us what was missing in the original? The story this time around is about the first original vampire and the first original werewolf. In this movie the first vampire was called Marcus and his brother William was the first werewolf. They are at war because William the leader of the werewolf pack is a vicious mofo killing and destroying villages left and right. Viktor the leader of the vamps wants William locked up for all eternity, Marcus; Williams vampire brother is against it...but goes with it for the sake of being at peace with Viktor. Fastforward a few thousand years...and now Marcus wants to set his brother free in order to create a new race of half vampires half werewolves.Len Wiseman gives this sequel the same polished squeaky clean look that the first movie had. In terms of look and feel this film is very much like the original film. Everything seems to be filtered through a blue/metallic light. The film looks slick. The only thing that really changes is that the first film took place in more of an urban setting...here we go into the sticks. Lots of mountains, caves and abandoned buildings in the middle of nowhere.This film improved on a lot of things that the first film was missing. First of all, the vampires on this movie are more vicious which was something that I hated from the first movie. On the first movie the vampires where portrayed as these bunch of pansies hanging out in mansions drinking blood in wine glasses and gossiping about each other. On this one, those gossipy vampires are gone replaced by a vicious and bloodthirsty Marcus, who is resurrected from his long slumber.The coolest part about this movie for me was the vampire Marcus, the make up effects work on this character was fantastic. His gigantic bat like wings which turn out to be quite deadly are awesome! This character is really evil, violent and lets his vampire nature run loose. Basically he wont have problems sucking the life out of anyone who stands in his way.And speaking of special make up effects, kudos to Wiseman for choosing to use actors in wolf suits instead of overusing the computer effects. I loved how the werewolves looked more realistic in this sense. Of course there is CGI involved in certain sequences but it is kept in check and not overused. The transformation sequences are great as well.There were a few things that didn't make some sense to me though. Like for example: why was Marcus the only vampire to have wings? OK he was the first vampire ever...but wouldn't his offspring have wings also? No explanation is given about this during the movie. Also, if Marcus and William were the first vampires and werewolf ever...how did they become what they became? They're origins are not explored but simply taken for granted. I didn't get that either. And how can William be locked up inside of a sarcophagus for thousands of years, the just pop out and walk around as it he had only been locked up for one day or two? He had not fed, werewolves as far as I know don't live forever and his hair isn't the least bit longer...what? Maybe I missed something amidst all the vampire lore and flashbacks. And there are a lot of those. I'm guessing a lot of these questions will be answered on a future sequel, so lets hold out for it, I'm sure it will happen.The movie does kind of have certain sequences in which they simply talk waaay to much. These vampires love to just chat chat chat in the most dramatic way about things. In that way this film is very similar to the first one.On the bonus side, we do get to see part of Kate Beckinsales nude body, but only partially. She never really goes all the way. It must have been hard for Wiseman to see his wife making out with Speedman. By the way, ladies, Speedman shows his bum. So enjoy it! So, in conclusion, this film has taken all of the things that didn't work on the first one and fixed em. There's more blood, more action, better effects, the werewolves seem more realistic and the evil vampire leader is one vicious mother. Good sequel, dare I say it certainly is better then the original.Rating: 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, it took me a while to get to this review, but there's a reason for it. It just takes some time for me to get over the disappointment for this movie, and now I'm ready to write something about it.Overall, the movie wasn't horrible. It was very average, and thus objectively I gave it that score. However, compared to the first Underworld movie, this one is much inferior. (I recently saw Underworld again and gave it an 8) Acting wise, it was about on par with the first movie, though neither movie contains Oscar level acting. For some reason, the action wasn't as "smooth" as the first one, and I felt jarred around a bit during some of the action sequences. Also, the CGI didn't look as good as the first movie. Add to that a pretty muddled storyline where they pretty much explained everything away (and the explanation wasn't that cool either), the movie lost all of the charm it had in the first one.To me, the Underworld universe was cool because of the new take on vampire/werewolf stories, the mysteries that we're trying to find out, and the very slick style. All three were thrown out the window for Underworld 2, thus making it just your run-of-the-mill action flick. How disappointing.Oh yeah, the ending was one of the most clichéd action movie endings I've seen. There's also a very "uncomfortable" scene in the middle of the movie where it's just completely gratuitous (and I usually like those scenes ) So all in all, rent this movie or don't see it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I have to say that the first Underworld has to be among my top 3 movies ever.This one, however isn't. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, it just doesn't have the same great vibes and story like the first one.Things I loved about the film is that it really is a good continuation from the first, and the fact that its a continuation of a film I love just makes it worth while.Things I had problems with though is that they changed the look, slightly, of the Lycans. In the first one it was actual people walking around in suits, and it looked great. . In this one, they totally look computer animated, they moved different, they seemed more flexible, the way they morphed looked different as well. . they were also much faster, and slightly smaller.I also had a problem with how they changed the action. In the first one, if someone got hit, they would have a more natural look. . In this one, if someone gets hit, they fly 10 feet in the air and crash through walls. . it all seemed to 'Matrix' and less 'Underworld.'Things just looked exaggerated, (SPOILERS) Like when a character is decapitated his head rather explodes and blood and guts fly everywhere, whereas in the first one, it simply fell off.If you can get over the few changes in the look and feel of the film, and if you are a fan of the first, this is a great movie. . Just do not go into this film expecting Underworld 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this was a very disappointing film. The first film was okay, not great, but good. I had hopes that this was at least be as good as the original.In its favour, the style and colours are great. Len Wiseman knows how to make a good looking film. It sets the standard for what a modern vampire movie should look like. I loved the dark, slick style. It excels beyond the first film in its smoothness and pace.The element that lets the film down is the story, or lack thereof. The first film presented a complicated story, with the whole vampire elders in hibernation thing/werewolves/bloodlines etc. Evolution doesn't follow on from this, it creates all these extra, unnecessary plots that ruin it. I didn't find that the new "twists" added interest at all, because the story became so convoluted and all over the place that it destroyed the legacy of the first film. Some people may like that, however, I wanted to see the next chapter of Selene and Michael, not a whole new 'adventure' for them to embark on.First: Selene suddenly remembered things that weren't even hinted at in the first film.Second: the werewolf at the end spent a lot of time just standing in one place being shot. Cool looking bullet effects, but a very stupid werewolf.Third: surely Viktor would know that Marcus isn't to be trusted, and would lock him up. Another departure from the first film, where nothing from Evolution's mixed up story is even hinted at (apart from the death of Selene's family, which is neither here nor there).Fourth: Michael is still a wuss. He may be a hybrid, but he isn't particularly good at anything. Selene says his powers could be limitless, but all he does is survive lots of bullets in one scene and comes back from the dead. Granted, that takes talent, but doesn't look good on film. Plus, he's a bit weak. I thought his make-up in the first film was extraordinary however.Fifth: Alexander Corvinus?? What sort of a left-field, useless plot introduction was that? I think that the writers tried to create some new, 'better' story that relied upon superfluous twists rather than solid, mature story development.Six: highly unnecessary sex scene. Admittedly, Kate Beckinsale is very cute, and Michael and Selene were always on the cards, but quite gratuitous (sp?). I do wonder what it was like for Len to direct that.Seventh: There seemed to be no repercussions from Selene killing Viktor. No one was hunting them, no one tried to capture them. Marcus chased them, but that was for entirely different reasons. In fact, there were very few vampires in the film at all.Eighth, the final scene sucked.Overall it was very disappointing. Rather than try to make up a whole new storyline, they should've just made a good film. But that's only my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I am not firmly in either camp when it comes to the first Underworld film, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. It was an enjoyable and stylish take on the old vampire and werewolf genre. I was surprised to see that there are so many obsessed fans of this film... I like chicks in leather with guns too but come on.I went to the sequel with no preconceptions. I had avoided any pre-press so that I wouldn't be too tainted before going in. What I found was disappointing to say the least. While the first film played out as an inter species monster political thriller the sequel is a dull and predictable bit of fluff. While Underworld carried interesting and intense motivations for the characters' actions, this was largely lacking from the follow up. Why did they have to do any of the things they had to do? I know their was some vague claims of great evil being unleashed... but what was it?There is supposed to be a great love story angle here as well but Speedman and Beckinsale do not deliver. The one dull sex scene is stiffer than plywood and not at a very sensible part of the film. There is absolutely no passion or chemistry between these two, despite the fact that every straight man on earth would gladly tear off Kat's leather corset. Perhaps this fault can be laid upon Speedman who could not act his way out of a paper bag (thank god he mostly growls and has very few lines in this film).SPOILER TIME!!!! The climax of the film was supposed to be the reuniting of the oldest and most powerful of the vampires and lycans. It was insinuated that this would bring about something momentous and evil... instead it lead to a subpar and quickly finished fight scene. Hey I have an idea, why not make the "most ancient and powerful" of the villains in your movie seem at least a little bit dangerous? They were dispatched with just a slightly greater degree of difficulty than the regular run of the mill baddies. If you are going to make a predictable video game movie (solve easy puzzles, fight easy bad guys, fight boss at the end of the level) make the boss interesting and hard to defeat. Both of the "super evil" brothers went out like complete punks. I also question the point of throwing in the immortal man (who was wounded and died pretty easily). I understand that he is supposed to be the old and wise Daddy but he didn't seem to be particularly bright or powerful. Maybe they should have fleshed out his character a bit more. This movie isn't horrid but I would definitely recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

With the sequel you get pretty much the same except the director seems to be under the strange illusion that he is talented and so has added a flashback structure which ruins the fun pacing of the first movie and allows the whole movie to descend to the level of farce. I hope to god i never have to sit through this god-awful tripe again, and in all honesty would prefer the tedium of three years at Patrick henry brainwashing college than watch anything this director ever makes in the future.

		<shortDescription>OK sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK sequel to UNDERWORLD will appeal to its core audience and few others. Too many flashbacks to the first movie do little to explain what is going on in the sequel -- that is, to the uninitiated and people like myself who hasn't seen the original in awhile. The plot is thin, although the action is fast and furious as vampire/warrior Kate Beckinsale is again on the track of those who threaten to destroy the world. Good-looking nonactor Scott Speedman is back as her love interest, himself a combination of vampire and werewolf who is virtually indestructible. And knowing this takes away some of the fun toward the end when the big fight is on and the chips are really down. But enough said about that. Beckinsale looks great in skin-tight black leather, and has a quasi-nude love scene with Speedman. The gore quotient is fully realized, thankfully. The monsters are great-looking, and the atmospheric photography and sets are first rate. Nevertheless, recommended only for fans of the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS. there is nothing to spoil here!this movie is just unbelievable. unbelievably BAD that is.uninspired performances throughout. you cannot really blame the actors, except for participating in this garbage. beats me, how the (otherwise rather talented) cast could possibly partake in this. they must have run out of money or something. there is NO other excuse. the story was lame and stupid. there was not ONE likable character in this. the sets were dark, virtually colorless. the special effects! oh man, you gotta see (for your own sake: don't see it!) to believe. cheap and jumpy. the werewolves and other ridiculous creatures mostly moved like in 1930 stop-motion models. i couldn't believe it.and of course there was an unbelievably uninspired and utterly misplaced love-story woven into it. i mean, hey, you just went through the most intense fight of your life, you are blood spattered and dead and grossly dismembered creatures all around you and of course the first thing that comes to mind is a deep kiss, right??this movie can only be enjoyed by brainwashed Americans. brainwashed by Hollywood's war machine and the most stupid TV system on this planet to mindlessly eat dark, violent and utterly heartless garbage like this.if you are not American, don't even consider spending a single cent on this. any somewhat cultured HUMAN being will regret it, believe me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had potential. Really- there were werewolves, vampires, guns, secret organizations, and climactic battles. What more could you ask for in an action movie? The big problem that killed the movie was the plot. Not to say that it was necessarily bad, or that it didn't have one, or even that it had too much of one. Though the case for all three of these could be made. It just was somewhere in between. They took what could have been a great overall plot for a thriller, and turned it into a bad action movie plot. They had too much plot-oriented nonsense for it to be pure action, and they had too little plot for the movie to make any sense.If the movie had been all about the gun-fighting with no real plot, it would have been one thing. If it had been all about the plot, with a little combat action thrown in at key points, it would have been one thing. Instead we are treated to poorly-executed action sequences (I'm looking at you, fight on the boat) and overly-long, pointless, poorly-executed flashbacks. We get it- she was someplace important many years ago. We don't need to see the same fifteen second sequence twelve times. Also, the plot merely added to the confusion created by all the random crap going on. That's not to say there weren't cool action sequences. The truck-fight through the winding mountain road was cool, relatively speaking. And so was the opening prologue about the eleventh century.Then there were just plain stupid moments. All the gratuitous sex and nudity being top on the list. Followed by the Elves from LoTR's armor being used. I understand that it's cheap and easy to get used armor from big-budget flicks. But could they have at least used something period-specific (actually resembling something that MIGHT have been used in the 1200s) and definitely not so easily recognizable. Finally, at the very end, I was irked by some very basic errors that no good filmmaker would have made. Most clearly in my mind I remember the plank-suspension bridge not falling down when its support ropes were cut. Apparently the people who made the movie don't know how bridges work. Though that last one is just me nit-picking.If this movie had only gone one or two steps further down its chosen outrageous road, it could have been like "Springtime for Hitler". Instead it is only almost funny-bad, but ended up just making my brain hurt.P.S. They really did aim for their target audience though: goth males who want to see nudity &amp; pale vampire chicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't suppose too many people saw this without seeing the original, so there things about this movie that I liked, but the things I disliked were the really huge logic gaps between the first movie and the sequel.I'll get to the things I liked first. Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather *drools*. Scott Speedman's acting was a huge improvement over his performance in the first movie. The special effects were good, if a little over used. The fight choreography was good. Derek Jacobi was excellent as always.Where the film lost me was that it was inconsistent with the logic from the first movie, for instance if Marcus was so keen on freeing his brother, why didn't he just wait for Viktor and Amelia to go into suspended animation for a 100 years and do his search then. In the first movie Selene is shown as being scared about the prospect of facing a werewolf in hand to hand combat, yet in this movie she easily despatches two werewolves in quick succession. The entire Selene being picked to become immortal because of knowledge only she had made no sense, and it violated the logic from the first movie about most mortals dying quickly when bitten by an immortal. The whole Corvinus plot was unexplained and made no sense - were his underlings mortals? what effect did his blood have? (well apart from making Selene an uber fighter)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful movie, I can not understand how the "main werewolf" comes out of his imprisonment and is supposed to be the ultimate etc... he stands on the screen going "RAHH" then gets his head ripped off, how droll. The first ten minutes were actually quite interesting and enjoyable, the medieval battle scenes were excellent and reminded me very much of vampire:the dark ages the roleplaying game. Considering the enjoyment I received from the original, to be so utterly disappointed by the second installment is shocking. The main characters are terribly acted, even though Kate Beckinsale is very sexy, her acting abilities are negotiable.There are plenty of guns and violence if thats what you want from you cinema experience, but, i warn you, this is not a good movie, in fact, its horrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high hopes, but have to say I was fairly disappointed. The plot was way too straightforward and action was overdone with long drawn out sequences and lots of blood. Any shock value in the fighting was lost early on in the movie. Reminded me more of cop shootemup except with characters dressed up like vampires and werewolves. The general concept, which made the first movie good, is still there, so I still enjoyed it more than most movies I've seen lately. But it could have definitely been better.Kate Beckinsale and her smoking hot costume and piercing blue eyes bring the rating up from a 4 to a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho Hum Story with Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will openly admit that I wasn't blown away with the first Underworld movie; however, I was willing to watch the sequel in hopes that it would develop and improve upon the first. Sadly, I was disappointed. As the plot has already been covered by others who have seen the movie, I shall dispense with summaries and discuss the film as a film. As with the first one, I found the rather bleached-blue film style annoying, although one could make the argument that this is an artistic choice. Beyond that, though, the story seemed weak and more a vehicle for action than a premise for a movie.There were several inconsistencies or merely weak points that prevented a strong storyline. (Spoilers may follow.) For example, the ending of the movie suggests that Selina, by drinking the blood of Alexander Corvinus, has now become some sort of either super-vampire or a hybrid herself. The final scene of the movie sees her standing in sunlight. There is no explanation and very little to set up an explanation in the rest of the film. Second, the love scene between Selina and Michael was absolutely nothing more than a gratuitous sex scene. It did nothing to further the story and might I add that a storage box seems like a rather uncomfortable place for sex. Third, the back-story of the brothers and the tension between father and sons was poorly developed to the point that I could barely keep names straight. There are numerous other points that I could make, but I think readers have probably understood my impression of the movie by this point.All of that said, the film seemed to please fans of the first Underworld, so I suppose it fulfilled its purpose. I rented the movie and found myself so bored with it that I ended up signing online and surfing the web to keep from falling asleep through the end. Thus, I probably missed a lot of the action that seemed to be the main purpose of the movie. The one redeeming factor of this film was that the actors did a pretty admirable job given the script they were handed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great coogly moogly, I've seen shrink-wrapped hamburger with more brains than "Underworld: Evolution," the not-so-'evolved' sequel to 2003's "Underworld." First off, I will put my shame out in the open--I had fun with the original; even if it had a plot devoid of complexity or surprise, it contained enough kinetic camera movements and impressive FX work that I gladly put my brain on the shelf for a lobotomizingly good time. As a meaningful piece of cinema, it was an utter failure, but from a purely aesthetic standpoint it was hard to top (that year, anyway). Now we have "Evolution," whose faults begin with the title (as nary a thing in this sequel shows improvement over the original--or anything else, for that matter), and accumulate like hairs on a werewolf during a full moon. The story this time out is contradictorily simplistic in its telling (a super-duper-mega-hybrid-lycan/vamp crossbreed is looking to rule the earth...or something) and convoluted in its mythology and backstory (neither of which I kept a close eye on)--the original film had a similar structural layout, but was buoyed by what were, at the time, innovative stunts and FX. "Evolution" might have been saved in a similar way if its bag of cinematic eye candy didn't reek of 3 years' staleness; the visuals have an utterly uninspired and recycled quality to them (the perpetually dark, mountainous, woodsy world with crumbling castles and CG snow falling so artistically...hang on, Narnia, here we come!), and the swooping camera angles and slo-mo have all become anomalies in the annals of current cinema. With nothing to entice us on a superficial level, we are all but forced to groan at the horrendous dialog scenes (an affront to human ears and intelligence both), though in a moment of shocking creativity, Kate Beckinsale's character uses the word "qualms." Add in the timeless cinematic convention of thunder sounding and lightning flashing through windows while characters recite lines intended to be revelatory, and you have the perfect film to fall asleep to on a rainy day, since you certainly won't be riveted or thrilled by anything happening on-screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Home Run For Wiseman...More Like He Was Walked to Second Base!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More Fun on the Second ViewingAs someone who found the first installment of this series fun, provocative, and nearly legendary, I found this much-awaited sequel somewhat of a disappointment on the first viewing.The prequel segment was far too short. It gave us the set up for the second installment and NOTHING of the back-story of the original, as was promised! The filming style of the prequel segment was the worst aspect, as it lacked the epic treatment most fans expected in this age of CGI brilliance and considering this entire production was filmed on the immense blue-screen stages set for "I, Robot." It was also filmed in Vancouver, BC rather than the more exotic locales of the first installment. All background was CGI. You would have expected more love to have gone into this prequel work, for which all the fans have been clamoring since the film's unexpected Hit.They've brought in new characters as principle personages. These are characters never even mentioned in the first work, giving the audience the sense that this work was hurried and just thrown together in desperation. Such was not the case, but the illusion was complete with the inclusion of the gratuitous sexual content obviously thrown in as a distraction away from the fact that this work was lacking. Of course, it also served as an obvious device to placate the fanboys of this genre and this series (Kate Beckinsale's butt in tight leather, in other words). Unfortunately, it was 100% gratuitous, as it had nothing whatsoever to do with the story line and was wholly unnecessary to the plot even after they fidgeted so hard to make it part of the thread.The story itself felt contrived, like they were reaching desperately for something...ANYthing...and just ran with what they brainstormed in one weekend. The story was there, but was missing some serious elements. This was another contributing factor in the work's feeling rushed and incomplete.Regardless of the above mentioned misgivings, this chapter of the Underworld saga was filled with tense moments, clever ideas, and (other than the prequel sequences) was filmed in a near-epic Gothic (almost film noir...NOT, but almost) style. Wiseman strove to maintain the same Gothic feel of the original and, while it was vaguely dispelled by the lack of genuine locations and architecture, it was still a tangible Gothic atmosphere even with the prolific use of CGI.While the story felt (as stated above) like an abbreviated contrivance, it also held some interesting elements. I won't detail those, as I'd rather not give away the best parts of this otherwise straight-to-video-quality work. Beckinsale reflects some of her character from "VanHelsing," this time around. Instead of the stoic matron of leather from the first Underworld, this time we get a hot-blooded Undead who will do what she can for her man. Nice sentiment from one of a race which is not supposed to be capable of love. But the "Vampyre Rules" put aside, they somehow made this story line flow well from one abrasive element to the other, without much interruption and distraction. The action sequences are awesome, and the set designs are inspired, but with the major disappointments upon first viewing, I couldn't give it more than a 6.2/10.Upon second viewing, however, with the initial shock and the let down of the prequel sequences out of the way, I found it was better than I'd first rated it; at least a 7.4/10. The reason most reviewers have regarded this work as "uneven" is because of the previously mentioned elements: the prequel was poor quality in comparison to the remainder of the film, the effects were awesome while the story line felt hurried and compromised, and the action was astounding while the characters portraying the action should have been better introduced. That, my friends, is uneven epitomized, regardless of the caliginous atmosphere.Again, it rates a 7.4/10 because it was a decent sequel from... the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A question about Marcus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was okay. Except for two things...The love scene lacked the emotional content that you see in porn films. That could have been either edited out or made more, um, "Intimate"...But my biggest complaint about this movie around my favorite character in the film, Marcus.When Marcus fights Michael the second time (the first time a mountain saved Michael), Marcus beats Michael down like a rug on a laundry line. Marcus impales Michael's body on a large pole and Michael's right-hand on a smaller pole.Michael is finished. Dead. Done.Then Marcus attacks Selene, and puts his wings through her upper thigh and writs, pinning her against the wall. She manages to get hold of a gun and shoot him, forcing him to fly away, but both Michael and Selene are defeated.Now towards the end of this movie. Marcus and Selene are fighting in a tunnel half-filled with water. Selene fires a shotgun blast from direct range that manages to only knocks him against the far wall. She then flees right before the massive wall comes down, apparently trapping Marcus.The wall though, closed on some rocks, leaving enough space for him to grab the bottom. Marcus changes to vampire form and a lift what is obviously a tonnage worth of weight to leaves the tunnel.Marcus next sees his brother William (a werewolf so nasty that when he turns someone into a werewolf, they stay a werewolf) under assault from the helicopter machine gunner. Marcus grabs the chain that hangs down from the rather large helicopter hovering in the sky, and PULLS THE HELICOPTER DOWN THROUGH THE ROOF, where it crashes into the bridge. Explain to me how Selene can even go hand-to-hand with Marcus (still in vampire form) on the bridge before it ends in the traditional sell-out ending? I would have loved to see Selene get killed by Marcus right after Marcus sees Michael kill William. Then it would have been Hybrid against Hybrid, because Michael did asked Selene (after he first fought Marcus), "He's a hybrid, isn't he?" To which Selene's answers, "Yes."...I left the theater in disbelieve at the ending?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't recall any evolution in this movie. Just because Markus changed a bit and Selene took a bit of blood from Corvinus, doesn't mean that the title should have the word Evolution in it.What happened to the awesome fight scenes from the first? Or the original rivalry between vampires and lycans? This movie almost ignores lycans and focuses on the battles between Selene and Markus and between Michael and William (which only last for 10 minutes).Basically, they turned the awesome masterpiece of 'Underworld', into a dumb movie that apparently got a lot of its ideas from BloodRayne (which came out a year before, and was even better than this trash) Don't watch it, trust me. It ruins the mysterious and great ending that the first one had.</fullReview>

I'll say a few good things: the CG was very good, the opening scene was badass, and the whole feral werewolf thing was pretty cool. However, the storytelling in this film was dismal at best, a goddamn whirlwind. Too much - too fast. A lot of people also say that the movie maintained the feel of the first one, I have to disagree. Boats and lame chase scenes have very little in common with the first flick. This was an expensive film, the first one was not (it was just well done). And I won't "spoil" anything, but for the many of you who have a problem with the ending, I agree... This movie deserves my vote, it just wasn't that good. You have to be crazy to give this movie a 10, not even the first one deserves a 10 and I love that movie.

What I was expecting was something similar to the first film, an action movie based in a world of vampires and werewolves. What I got was poorly designed fight sequences that relied far too heavily on CG and gore. CG isn't always bad, but the CG was not done particularly well. The other problem in this film is that it was far too predictable. I could see exactly what was going to happen before it happened. There was nothing at all new to this film, and yet it departed enough from the storyline of the original film in order to make it not very enjoyable.

And Selene is now my new movie hero after Neo from Matrix, she is tough and sexy, she has powers and skills I can only dream about. Underworld Evolution is a brutal and bloody story; a movie with good pace and great action - and visually tremendous! The plot is attractive for me, and it is very well constructed. It is an exiting sci-fi horror movie, but it's a shame that Norwegian critics showed so little enthusiasm for it - please forgive them, they didn't see what the audience saw! But I dug Underworld Evolution, and that's good enough for me. The actors are good - and the make-up even better.

		<fullReview>Over all, I'm still very much immersed in the world set up by the writers and director Len Wiseman. The characters are very interesting, but we get around the same run time to develop the characters and so I somewhat lose interest. Michael Corvin still isn't that great of a character but he has more to do in this one and he comes off as okay. The awesome Kate Beckinsale is back and continues play the role quite well. Markus (Tony Curran) has a great look to him and he's a great antagonist although I can't say he has the presence of the great Bill Nighy. His brother is a great looking werewolf but he's a mindless monster so his threat is somewhat limited from my perspective. The decision makes him a lackluster villain who spills plenty of blood but nothing else.The score by Marco Beltrami is a damn good one, loving his works. The action in Hollywood fashion is intense and enjoyable. The vivid sex scenes are merely eye candy but I'm sure most won't complain. I highly recommend the movie but the first one is still the greatest by far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened, Len?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The continuing story of Selene (Beckinsale), the werewolf-fighting vampire, and Michael (Speedman), the vampire-werewolf hybrid, is presented in the second installment of the Underworld franchise. Because I loved the original, I eagerly awaited this sequel for months before its release in January of 2006. What I got was a very different approach from the director than what I got with the first of this series. While the first was almost devoid of gore and sex scenes, due to Wiseman's wish to not give in to the stereotypical werewolf vs. vampire movie, Evolution starts off with a graphic massacre, is filled in with a graphic (and weirdly filmed) sex scene, and ends with more graphic death scenes.Despite this, Kate Beckinsale still pulled off an amazing performance of the conflicted vampire heroine, and Scott Speedman kept in character acting mainly as a sidekick, with the exception of the ending. Tony Curran made the film, however, as the ultra-villain, Marcus. With wicked-looking prosthetics and makeup, he made the villains in the first Underworld chapter pale in comparison. Sadly, Marcus disappointed me slightly with his one-track mind, which did not seem to fit with the history of the character and those of the other two vampire Elders. Sir Derek Jacobi as the immortal Alexander Corvinus was a very good casting choice, but again, his single-mindedness and explanations for previous actions did not make much sense in the grand scheme of the story.My main complaints for this film were the excessive amounts of blood and gore, and the oddly placed sex scene between the main characters. It seemed to just be put in the film to attract more viewers than the previous movie did. However, even though I believe this film to be slightly worse than the first Underworld, the directing style remains an effective way to make the saga of Selene and Michael all the more otherworldly and eerie by desaturating the picture (a process which drains the image of most color) in order to make the blues, grays, blacks, and whites stand out much more. This, I found, was a better choice than overloading the screen with bright, flamboyant colors. There were also various plot holes that I feel could have been explained or fixed, but the filmmakers did not give clarification on these in either Underworld or Evolution.All in all, I could have done with a little less blood and a little more meat to the plot, but it was still a very enjoyable film and a nice addition to the Underworld legend. As a side note, with as many times as I have been asked this question, I feel that I must mention that I do not recommend anyone under the age of 16 to watch this movie. It's rated R for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really disappointing movie. It totally lacked the intricate plot of the first one, substituting it with violent action galore. Not only did the continuing fighting scenes get boring after some time, but they were also relying on cheap shock effects adding nothing to the oh so thin story. It's a shame that the makers did not have the courage to add to the complicated storyline the first movie provided.There were a whole bunch of question marks left after the film finally ended, but I did not care. One vampire could do this, the other vampire could do that, no consistency at all in what the races were able to perform - as long as the shock effect was guaranteed, any character could do just what came into the mind of the director.If not for Kate Beckinsale looking great and getting out of her suit in one scene (hot!), this movie would not be worth watching at all. A real letdown after the really well done first movie.</fullReview>

All of the elements for a good horror classic were there but unfortunately, the director failed to put it together in a meaningful, coherent way.

		<fullReview>I don't know what surprises me most about this sequel... that it and its forbear have received reasonably high ratings on the IMDb, that Derek Jacobi is slummimg in something like this, or that a sequel was even made in the first place.It's not that I look down on the horror genre, when done well, but all the characterisation, plot points and "twists" in both movies are so generic and uninspired. The trailer offers up a number of titillating glimpses and towards the end relies heavily on the sexuality of the very beautiful Kate Beckinsale. And I'd be lying if I said I hadn't rented the film out just to see her buttocks in tight leather for 100 minutes. Yet even that palls after a time, as there's only so many times you can watch a not-terribly-convincing CGI werewolf get shot while Kate backflips all over the place.The first twenty minutes or so are quite slow and rely heavily on the viewer remembering what happened in the first film. I didn't, particularly - wasn't a lot more of it set in contemporary society or am I thinking of something else? - and so I couldn't help but focus on how much trouble Bill Nighy seemed to be having with his contact lenses.Ultimately, this is not bad, Beckinsale comes out of it pretty well, as does the guy from This Life. I might suggest that it's stale, repetitive and derivative, but then I suppose that's missing the point, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry - but this movie is a joke. The computer generated images looked so fake that it wasn't even scary. This underdeveloped technology has ruined movies. The effects of older movies look REAL. Computer generated movies are ridiculous, especially in this movie - some of the worst I have seen yet. The Lycans were laughable... the action moves so fast that you can't even see what the hell is happening. I guess they do that to try to cover up how fake it all appears. If it a blur, you can't see much - nice philosophy. This movie was a huge disappointment especially in this regard, but the plot sucked too. If you don't have vertigo, you will after you are done watching this movie... it is all a freaking' blur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the first sequel was not an awesome movie, but at least a pleasant one.Underworld : Evolution is simply very boring. The story is basic and minimal, the actors' playing appears not good nor bad. But I had the odd feeling that I was watching a Power Rangers episode. There are the goods and the bads, they own both the ability to transform in stupid monster in order to fight with an odd pretext.In short, Underworld : Evolution is a succession of (boring and too long) action scenes, with almost no dialog. You will probably don't like it if you just find the one 'not bad'.I think the only positive point of this movie is the music : common but effective and pleasant.Don't lost your time seeing this movie, even if you love Kate Beckinsale!</fullReview>

WTF? Why the f*** was that necessary?!I never liked the (from the beginning) overpowered character of Michael corvin, so when he gets impaled at the later part of the film i became quite hopeful... sadly, i did not die...Don't SEE THIS FILM! NOT IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST ONE...THIS WILL Totally RUIN THE FIRST UNDERWOLD (which i think is a very good film)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**-----------SPOILER HEAVY------------** This movie has logic problems up the yin-yang. Lets get to basics here. how do you kill a werewolf, silver weapons, or somehow rip them to pieces. How do you kill a vampire, UV light, stake in heart, remove the head. 1. So you are a group of super commandos going after the father of all vampires who is trying to free the father of all werewolves. Don't you think it might be a good idea to take ammo that can kill werewolves AND vampires? They can figure out how to make silver bullets and UV bullets but somehow SILVER UV bullets is beyond them? 2. The immortal Alexander Corvenus dies from being stabbed in the stomach? but before that he cuts his wrist has Selene feed on him there, never mind the HUGE GAPING HOLE in his chest and the 3 gallons of blood on the floor. How does he even bleed from the wrist? Then he goes and blows up the single best equipped base for fighting vampires and werewolves on the planet just so the film makers could use some pyrotechnics.3. Marc(K)us corvenus pulls a helicopter down to earth with a rope?!? How is this even possible? By all the laws of physics he should have pulled himself up no matter how strong he was. But here again a senseless plot device to have a dramatic fight in front of the deadly spinning rotors. Honestly, who didn't see the ending coming a mile away after the helicopter crashed? It really took all the excitement out of the final fight. 3.5 Somehow Marcus is able to hover while flying BACKWARDS with bat wings in front of the moving truck. Obviously the film makers are not a big fan of physics.4. The legend (according to the film) goes, if you kill the Corvinus brothers then all the werewolves and vampires turn normal again. But then we have someone who says that is a lie. Yet when Marcus is killed Selene still has fangs like a vampire, heals like a vampire but is not hurt by UV light. Come on, pick a story and stick to it. Somehow killing Marcus turns vampires into daywalkers yet leaves all their other powers.5. The nudity in this film was gratuitous, poorly done and totally unnecessary. We just escaped from the king of all vampires, lets get it on in this nasty, rusty cargo container. Oh and don't forget to turn on the super bright flare because we all know neither vampires nor werewolves can see in the dark. And I usually don't comment on sex scenes but if you are going to put one in, at least make it look right. Either he had an attachment on his knees or he finds her belly button more stimulating than the conventional spot because there is no anatomical way that would work.6. Why do vampires and werewolves require so much light to see. For creatures of the night they sure do scramble around when not is well lit areas. They make it a big point in the store room to show that Selene stuffs a handful of flares into her gear.All in all this movie is about as bad as Blade 3, matrix 3, X-men 3, or any of the other craptastic sequels that have come out in recent years. Illogical, contrary to itself, and ultimately pointless when we know the outcome of the movie after the first half hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that should not have been made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched and enjoyed the first film I was quite excited to see the newest release as the sequel had the backing that the original did not. All I can say is that the script failed here folks. The acting was OK but since they kept the same characters you couldn't expect much more. The problem lies in the pieced together storyline. We're explained that everything we thought we knew from the first film was an extravagant lie. This led on to a continuous barrage of random fight encounters to give the audience some blood and bad dialogue trying to force a bad story. Too many of the fight seems seemed forced. It was almost like the writer figured, "ok 15 minutes no fighting, um lycans attack yeah!" The movie was starting to play out like T2 in the sense that the hybrid (Speedman) was terminator protecting Selena from the crazy "original" vampire Marcus. But even that action seemed stagnant as Marcus seemed too powerful at the beginning but then weak at the end of the movie. He takes a facefull of bullets yet goes around like they were peanuts but later takes a shotgun shot to the chest and is taken aback by it. This movie had problems all around. I wouldn't recommend it for a watch even if you liked the original. This one needs to be placed in the Walmart bargain bin and left there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld:Evolution is pretty much what I expected but hoped I wouldn't see, a predictably poor sequel (or "follow-up", if you will) to the original Underworld. All the glossy camera-work, CGI effects, and the eye-straining blue filters used to film this dull movie were for naught: it's confusing, has plot holes all over the place, and never really takes off despite furious action sequences that don't really excite and all seem exactly alike. As a spoiler to make a point here, the final battle between Selene and the batman telegraphs its ending before it begins: on the blades of the wrecked helicopter. Batman beats the pudding out of Selene and suddenly she turns into SuperSelene and immediately kills Batman. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was running out of time and needed to move the movie along. The same thing goes with the final battle of the werewolf and hybrid..both fight sequences are exactly alike. It's time for Kate Beckinsale to stop appearing in vampire movies and get a day job. Her poker-faced performance in this tedious movie is actually worse than her campy Transylvanian warrior slut turn in "Van Helsing", an acting milestone that was overlooked for that Razzie award it deserved. "Evolution" isn't so much a bad movie as it is dull, and perhaps that is the real problem with this used-up franchise.</fullReview>

It goes into all the details about how it all began there was not much action and it was not very entertaining. Blade trinity was better and I didn't consider blade trinity even close to being better than the first underworld. The first underworld brought excitement,action, suspense and was not predictable unlike its followup evolution. This was truly a waste of what could of been one of the greatest prequels. But surprisingly was horrible it didn't even seem like the same movie. seriously waste of my money don't waste yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Underworld sequel in the franchise better then the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution (2006) is one of the best action/vampire/werewolves sequel to the original blockbuster 2003 'Underworld'. I love the original film, but I just love this one much better! Awesome superb sequel. In my opinion this is better than the first one. The acting and the action were pretty good. Vampires and werewolves and lots of guns! Underworld: Evolution was introducing a war between Vampires and Werewolves, where a Vampire "Death Dealer," Selene (Kate Beckinsale), fights to save a human named Michael (Scott Speedman) from becoming a pawn in a scheme by the Werewolves to create a powerful Vampire-Werewolf hybrid. Underworld Evolution returns the primary characters who survived the first film, continues the story, and provides historical backgrounds on the Vampires, Lycans, and the war that rages between the species, all the while charting new territory and increasing the action violence several times over from that seen in the first film.As the war between the Death Dealers and the Lycans rages on, Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the vampire warrior, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the werewolf hybrid, once again work together to stop one of the four elders who has also turned into another hybrid, in this sequel to the 2003 blockbuster film, 'Underworld'. I personally love this series because it's a total new twist on how we perceive vampires and werewolves. The story is full of action and adventure with a mystery plot that keeps you curious all the way to the end. I love the original film to death! Evolution is much better it has it all no question about that. but watch the original 1st so you can pick up on where this one picks up from. this is full of action plots! This movie is a fast improvement over the original film, not only making a shorter version of the film than the original was, cause the original film I realized was 2 Hrs. and 13 mins. long. This movie all together runs 1 Hr. and 46 min. So it is a bout 15 mins, 10.mins cut, which is a good movie. So that's a lot better because Underworld don't need to be 2.hrs that long. To get the plot along and the movie along. Underworld Evolution brings back everything I love about the first movie, the actors. All the actors seemingly returns + all with some new faces, but that's it! The acting is outstanding in the movie! The effects just like the first movie, this movie realized heavily on practical effects, the helicopter that was flying all around during the movie, yea that was venture, kind a remote control type helicopter! I know that because I used watched the special features on my DVD that was before got the Blu-ray. That is the time I watched all my features. Yes I appreciate the models and little sex, that they made for this movie to keep, the budget the cost the movie down. Always, always outstanding when they do that, specially when you don't know it is a model but you van tell at certain point that you know the truth, so well done, well done! Of course the make up always look good for the werewolves and the lycans not the lycans the werewolves that they are lycans and the vampires that they have to fight against each other all that looks good! Very look good! Very well put together! This is very well put together movie I was actually kind a surprised, that I actually enjoyed this one a lot more! As a true fan of horror, the Underworld series was something I have waited my whole life for, but never thought would be realized in the horror genre. Extremely rare to see such intelligence put into these types of movies! "All that is certain is that darkness is still ahead." Kate Beckinsale is back as vampire heroine Selene in the highly anticipated sequel to Underworld. Underworld Evolution continues the saga of war between the aristocratic Death Dealers and the barbaric Lycans (werewolves). The film traces the beginnings of the ancient feud between the two tribes as Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the vampire heroine, and her love Michael (Scott Speedman), the lycan hybrid, try to unlock the secrets of their bloodlines. The tale of action, intrigue and forbidden love takes them into the battle to end all wars as the immortals must finally face their retributionUnderworld: Evolution (2006) is an American action-vampire film directed by Len Wiseman. It is the second (chronologically, the third) installment in the Underworld series, following Underworld (2003). The events of the film begin during the same night of the first film's finale. In the film, Selene and Michael fight to protect the future of the Corvinus bloodline from its hidden past.I love this film also it has Selene that she never kills a human been, she could have killed those Russian soldiers firing machine guns on her and Michael and she didn't. Kate Beckinsale did a wonderful performance including Tony Curran as Marcus Corvinus he killed Kraven (Shane Brolly) in the opening scene, that was just outstanding! The best one in the series. Selene learns the truth about the slaughter of her family, I love the fact that film tells more the story than the first one did. Len Wiseman did an outstanding direction debut as his second film of the Underworld movie series. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Screen Gems, Lakeshore Entertainment Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Tony Curran, Shane Brolly, Steven Mackintosh, Derek Jacobi, Bill Nighy Director: Len Wiseman Producers: Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, Richard Wright, Len Wiseman, Kevin Grevioux, Danny McBride Screenplay: Danny McBride Story: Len Wiseman, Danny McBride Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 46 Mins.

		<shortDescription>Interesting Religio-philosophical allegory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7. And add that most of that seven comes from a combination of good dramatization and equally good special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evolution? Pruning the past? Back to the future? Strap in and enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 7 of 10 Sequel to Underworld. Evolution takes up where Underworld ends. Treachery and the craving for power appears to be where this story is headed as you step into the continuing saga. Selen (Kate Beckinsale) convinced the only way to stop the Vampire clans power grab by Kraven is to awaken Marcus, the original and most powerful vampire. This beginning sorts itself out rather quickly.There is ample tension built into this movie from the beginning... between Marcus and Victor who Selen had awakened in Underworld to fight a rise in population of Lycans which had been thought to be almost extinct to start. There is also a lot going on between Michael, the hybrid, and Selen. This expresses itself as a romantic sub-plot and as co-protagonist that are largely "pursued" in Evolution. The Michael/Selen action doesn't seem to drive the main plot except as vehicles to carry the story from place to place. It might just be I'm thinking the characters are aren't terribly deep but they are cliché enough that you fill in the blanks. Sometimes that is the best way to keep a movie at a quick pace without slowing to explain things you will conclude without explanation.I was confused on a couple things early in the movie. Some things just didn't make sense to me. Hang on... the movie does move rather quickly and the blanks are filled in a bit later in the movie.The father of Marcus (vampire and antagonist) and William (werewolf), is Covinus, and makes his entrance into the story. Covinus is the original immortal, as the story goes, and who has only been hinted at in the series previously. It appears he is after whatever Marcus is after. Covinus appears a completely normal human with plenty of underlings and lots of technology. The movie doesn't go into this, but it is an easy assumption that if you've lived that long you've acquired pretty much anything you'd want to have.After an unexplainable confrontation between Marcus and our protagonists, who manage to escape, there's a little romantic eye candy followed by a trip to an exiled vampire, Tanis, who is believed to know the answers Selen and Michael are seeking. Here the boom-bang excitement hiccups and is then reduced to a crawl so the narrative can reveal all the things you have been confused about to this point.At this point in the movie (60 minutes in) you have a real good idea about the story and only lack a touch of motive which is easily understood later. What is left is to sit on the roller coaster and hang on TIGHT for the ride.You might prematurely conclude this movie is gratuitous action, violence, and gore, but you'd be short changing yourself. The Underworld series of movies arc through the Romeo and Juliet plot, and with this story changes to a kind of love story you may not expect. With all the intrigue, twists, and turns you get, and even knowing "the story" well before the end, you'll still want to be around for the conclusion as you can only experience that by going the distance with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improves On Everything From the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution picks up right where Underworld left off. Selene and Michael are alone and are now on a quest to find out the truth about Selens family and their origins. The film is presented with the same beautiful dull grays that made the original a treat to watch.The big difference right off the bat is that the movie now revolves around Selene and Michael and not Vampire clans vs Lycan clans. I much preferred it this way as we got to see more of Scott Speedman's Michael. And of course, you can never have enough Kate Beckinsale.As far as action, Underworld Evolution takes everything from Underworld to the next level. The movie starts off with a bang as the opening fight scene was better than anything in the first. The movie doesn't let up much as it is pretty action heavy and brutal throughout.If you enjoyed Underworld than this is a must see. I would also encourage anyone who liked the premise of one to give this a shot even if they didn't enjoy it as I feel Underwolrd Evolution is far superior in every way.</fullReview>

Jacobi counts his pay off and dies without a fight, happy to leave and saving the world is left to Kate who still thinks it's a worth acting for. She also gets to suck on Jacobi's super vamp blood which at last highlights her as the real hero(ine) rather than the ineffective surf dude hybrid who's typically knackered and while his powers maybe limitless, is off having a kip. So off Kate's ass goes for a showdown with the Sons of Katie Elder and with her ass they don't stand a chance! Dude finally wakes and it's double showdown time with the Thompson twins.

		<shortDescription>An Exception to the Rule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Costing approximately $50 million to produce, this film takes up where the original movie ("Underworld") left off. Marcus (played by Tony Curran) has awoken from his vampiric slumber with the blood of a lycan (werewolf) now coursing through his veins. With both Amelia and Victor dead, Marcus decides to free his brother William, who as the very first werewolf, was imprisoned because he was so wild and uncontrollable. In order to free William, Marcus needs two keys: One belonging to his immortal human father, "Alexander Corvinus" (played by Derek Jacobi) and the other in the possession of "Michael" (Scott Speedman) and "Selene" (Kate Beckingsale). Rather than reveal the entire plot, I will simply say that this movie makes very effective use of action and computer imagery which definitely enhances the film. Likewise, Kate Beckinsale turns in a superb performance and, quite frankly, looks exquisite both in and out of black leather. Additionally, I think the director (Len Wiseman) deserves a great deal of credit for the success of this picture as he manages to recreate the eerie Gothic look which gives this film (and its predecessor) its unique character. That said, more often than not, sequels are rarely as good as the film they follow. Fortunately, this one is an exception to the rule. If you liked the first movie then I believe you will like this one just as much. Both are equally entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first "Underworld" movie was fast paced but felt slow, this movie is more fast paced and actually feels fast paced. Although it seemed like not much effort went into the production of this movie, but it was a bit more entertaining than the first movie. When I first saw this, the story didn't seem to drag. Although the story in itself is far from being great and it's average at best. Kate Beckinsale makes her appearance as the protagonist as Selene the vampire who is known as Death Dealer. She is nice to look at and she is good at what she does as the vampire warrior. For a sequel it surpasses the original not because it had more effort gone for it, but it actually felt fast paced this time and somewhat entertaining despite it being shorter than the first one.6.2/10</fullReview>

Also they have to face the ruthless vampire elder, Marcus.The acting is pretty good. Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and a beautiful one at that.

		<shortDescription>There is nothing bad about the film, it just does not live up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is in some ways the typical sequel; while the action remains exciting the story is not as engaging as it was in the original. Underworld: Evolution takes place directly after the original with Selene and Michael on the run. All of the people killed at the end of the first are lying in and around the mansion as a new evil rises. Due to this, the film quickly immerses the audience into the story of the film and it is enjoyable. Everything is happening at a good pace with lots of exciting action sequences but sadly there soon comes a point where the film slows down. Even when new characters are introduced, the film never really picks up again until the very end. While the villain is good and comes with a lot of back-story, which fans will love, there is too much exposition with people explaining events that happened hundreds of years ago and are not that interesting. This wouldn't have been a problem had it of been interesting and that there was not too much of it but there was and will lead to the viewer's attention to drift off, leaving them confused.That said the story is still interesting in places and it is refreshing to have an action film that deals with the history of certain characters. While it is far from average the slow down in the middle takes the audience out of the film and it never quite recovers from that. When the film is good, it never quite reaches what the original achieved but the final action sequence was exciting and included what fans would expect from the film. Worth watching for anyone interested.</fullReview>

Selene wishes to expose the truth about the death of Viktor to the first true vampire Marcus that is hibernating. However, Marcus has already awakened and wants to release his savage Lycan brother William, who has been imprisoned for centuries. When Marcus tries to get the medal possessed by Lucian from Michael, Selene decides to visit Andreas Tanis, the exiled official historian of the covens, to understand his interest. When Selene and Michael meet Tanis, they disclose the truth about their bloodlines, and later with the support of Alexander Corvinus, Selene faces the powerful Marcus as the last hope left for the mankind. This Introduces Alex Corvinus For The First Time. At The Moment "The Crow" Franchise Is Really Getting Dodgy On The Title From Me As The Greatest Film Franchise Of All Time Because Of This. I Am Not Lying. The Lycan V.S Death Dealer Chronicles Are Really Great. This Also Goes Deeper Into The Relationship Of Selene &amp; Michael Corvin. If You Want A Film With The Quallity Of The First Try 'Blade' But If You Want Something Slightly Different Try This. One More Thing Kraven Is One Of The Characters I Hated In The 1st One So I Was Pretty Pleased When He Got Killed By Marcus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for a gory monster thrill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems kind of pointless, in my opinion, to develop such an extensive mythos and history for a centuries old vampires vs. lycans (werewolves) premise when everyone's just going to try and kill each other anyway. Underworld creators Len Wiseman and Danny McBride impressively flesh out their world and backstory, especially so in "Underworld: Evolution" -- then they have all the characters' rip each others flesh out. It's fun for those looking for an imaginative gore-fest, but don't expect to feel deeply invested in the unnecessarily complex story. I imagine if I were in Wiseman and McBride's shoes, I would want to carefully craft my story down to the finest of details and take great pride in my own creation -- but that seems like a lot of energy expended just riddle a film with bullets and blood. Fans of the 2003 film, however, are apt to expect that and in that end they won't be let down.The film picks up right where the original left up and reminding us of the key pieces: Selene (Beckinsale) has killed vampire patriarch Viktor (Bill Nighy) and she and vampire/lycan hybrid Michael (Speedman) are now on the run from the one remaining patriarch of the coven, Marcus. To go any further into the story would take an essay's worth of writing.So neither will the fans who actually enjoyed the backstory and wanted to learn more be disappointed. But doing supporters a solid doesn't make "Evolution" great by default.From the opening scene back in the past with all the vampire immortals decapitating lycans in the snow, Wiseman lets you know this is all about bloody, gruesome death. He wants to catch you muttering "awesome" under your breath as many times as possible. It would've been nice for him to be a bit more selective and not actually construct plot events around creative death scene ideas to make the goriest ones stand out a bit more, but why be nitpicky?Wiseman is also a fan of the vampire sex appeal thing. There's some blood and nudity which is certain to get a select groups' blood flowing and it's incredibly deliberate and non- essential. It can definitely be accused of being bloody vampire porn, but let's just call it Wiseman aiming to please his audience."Underworld: Evolution" is mindless monster action thriller with a lore/backstory that vies to outdo the Old Testament. Fans of the genre will find parts of it to enjoy, fans of "Underworld" will love it and I enjoyed it just enough to feel like I wasn't wasting my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story continues (with nothing new)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thought has been on my mind for months now, but with Underworld Evolution, I've decided to make the following statement an official piece of advice. Labeling a sequel as 'more of the same' is a negative thing, not a positive one. Underworld Evolution, takes a couple of things one step ahead from its predecessor, but with everything else, it takes a huge step in the other direction. Here we see the same fight scene four or five times, and it is shot in a way that may provoke headache.Picking up from where we left off, with Seline and Michael (now a mega hybrid of werewolf) They are still on the run, only this time from a completely different menace. There will be blood for sure.Underworld was both a werewolf and a vampire flick. This one is ten times more of a werewolf movie. Most critics and film scholars have argued that werewolves are unsexy, romantic or glamorous next to vampires, but if you want to make a counter argument, the character of Michael in Underworld evolution is good evidence, (Although suppose Taylor Lautner would be a more popular choice today) All the other wolves in this flick are not so sexy, but they are among the most ferocious that I've seen. They are big and muscular, and move more like grizzly bears, than the long skinny creatures in say the Howling or the more recent Dog Soldiers.Sequels like Underworld Evolution are only for the die hards fans of their predecessors. I liked Underworld, but didn't love it. I will always try a sequel if the first was good enough, but I didn't much care for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy, but somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flick was good. The opening scene was one of the coolest action sequences I've seen to date. After that it got better, and for the first 45 minutes, it was awesome. The acting isn't great, but its acceptable. The whole new plot around the makers of the Lycans and the Vampires was refreshing. Then the plot got a bit strange and the ending was a bit predictable. Of course, this movie is three times more violent than the first. I think also Selene began to lose character. The effects in this movie are better, but in Underworld the Lycans are mostly made of puppets. In Evolution they are still puppets, but half blended with CGI. It was a better version for me.Overall: Good film, just not as good as it could of been(probably cause of the predictable ending).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fair Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most of the sequels are much worse than the previous film and rarely do you have a better one, this one fortunately just gets slightly worse than Underworld.As Selene kills Viktor, she escapes from the vampires with Michael. Marcus, the last elder alive, wakes up and runs after Selene. After meeting Tanis Selene understands why Marcus is after and her family was killed. To stop Marcus and William, the first werewolf who's unable to control himself, Selene gets the power of Alexander Corvinus, the father of the two species, before he dies.The plot of this film develops smoothly from the necklace, which is in fact part of the key to William's prison, Selene got from Lucian. While Marcus is trying to get the key, the whole story is almost fully explained. But of course there can still be a lot to develop and that's the reason why a prequel is announced.There's no much improvement in actions and the director has made a mistake that most films did - making the film more bloody and ugly as Michael doesn't only turn blue like he did in the first film but turns into more like in between a human and werewolf. This never helps a film to be better and this is no exception.Another thing I found more annoying is the unnecessary slow motions of some shots, especially when Michael is splashing paint on the windows. The sex scene is another "can-be-cut" scene as it's not as passionate as the director supposed. I also don't understand why in many films the enemies in the last battle die that easily (see how Michael defeats William), which makes the battle much less watchable.Despite the fair performance of the cast once again and the many flaws I mentioned, the pictures, atmosphere and plot are still able to make the film a worth-watching one. Though I'm less satisfied with this sequel I'll still look forward to its prequel as the story itself is just thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always had a problem with 'immortal' characters. 'The Matrix's' Neo, for example, is one such 'immortal' character. Unstoppable, unhurtable (I doubt that's a word), indestructible. You can't associate with these demi-Gods, and that's one thing that lets down 'Underworld: Evolution'. Michael is one such character, and whereas I could root for him as a fairly average human being thrown in amongst vampires and werewolves, only to become something greater at the end of the first film, but as this immortal werepire/vampwolf...On the other hand, 'Underworld: Evolution' does offer some impressive scenes, critters and SFX. It's quite a visually stunning film (I know we shouldn't use that sort of terminology but I can't help it - I love the look of this film) but it feels as if the novelty of the first 'Underworld' has worn off a little. As a fan of the first film it's hard not to like this film, and I admit it's good, but it's just doesn't have the magic the first one had. Five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution: 7 out of 10: I have a new Mantra for you "forget the plot". C'mon repeat after me "forget the plot". Good now you are ready to watch this movie. Leaving the plot aside (Vampires and werewolves hate each other and are at war and have the same kin and the fate of the world blah blah blah?) We have Kate Bekinsale running around for 106 minutes in a tight corseted leather outfit killing pretty much everyone while great FX and great cinematography surround her.Anything else? Well the violence is surprisingly more Saw than action movie, there is brief nudity (not from Kate mind you), there are some neat toys that would make James Bond jealous and the movie is never boring. The lack of boredom really saves this film. It is easy on the eyes (FX, cinematography, Kate) and unlike Van Helsing there are really no groan inducing stunts (I.E. no horse and carriage leaping the Grand Canyon while everyone plays Spiderman.) Outside of the back-story thick plot there is one fly in this action packed ointment, Scott Speedman.Speedman plays a hybrid wolf vampire like he wandered in off the set of Jennifer Anniston romantic comedy where he is a florist and she a newly divorced waitress raising her niece. Hey Speedman this is Underworld Evolution not a Felicity Halloween special. Even his beast form looks more like a hirsute member of the blue man group than anything dangerous and his "superpowers" are used for such manly tasks as opening a can of paint. (Good God he can't even get the sex scene right either his genitals are located near his knee or he was attempting to copulate with Miss Beckensale's navel.) So despite a wussy good guy character out of an empowerment romantic comedy and a plot that no one could possibly care about Underworld Evolution is a pretty fun ride.</fullReview>

Why is it all so perfect, it is shown through style, not through character, and they have to narrate the whole bloody thing so people know what is going on. This is the beginning of the year of bad sequels: Tokyo Drift, X3, Garfield 2, hopefully Clerks 2 won't fall in here, it's such a shame, why can't Hollywood Studioos treat it's viewers with respect and make something good?I guess we can only wait and see, best options nowadays are to go to the Independent films: Brick, Good Night and Good Luck, A Scanner Darkly, Three Burials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing and too Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assume this is a tale about a fight for supremacy between Vampires and Werewolves. I shut this down after 10-minutes of still not knowing who were the Good Vampires, the Bad Vampires and the Good Werewolves and the Bad Werewolves. At this point I didn't much care.All the scenes were too dark, and you couldn't tell who were the Good, the Bad and they were all Ugly. And, that nervous camera was again at work, at night, really making a mess of things. One group of fighters with their Battle-gear on were like Klingons ? you couldn't tell one from the other.Someone must take some responsibility and remember there is an audience who are not up on these Vampire and Werewolf things. Don't confuse us with a lot of mumbo-jumbo Vampire-Werewolf history gibberish, rapid-fire dialogue, and also rapid-fire fighting scenes. What would have helped is the Good Vampires and Good Werewolves should have been allowed to wear White Hats, and of course the Bad Vampires and Bad Werewolves to have worn the Black Hats. Well, what about the Good Guys riding White Horses? Then we in the audience would have stood a chance of seeing who was killing, stabbing, slicing, and sucking the life out of who. Whom? But, the real culprit here was the darkened scenes. Everything was in shadows. Ah, maybe this was a movie only for Vampires and cats? I think if this is a comic book, the fans of this Underworld stuff probably grooved on this. They knew what was going on. They were the only ones.....if this is based on a comic book.One other point: In the beginning of the movie the year came upon the screen as 1200AD. Yet, we find that there was electricity, computers, what looked and sounded like AK47s. So maybe this wasn't happening on Planet Earth. I will never know. I am not going back. If this got better, I will never know. Doubt it though.But, truth be known, I only took this out because I thought Rona Mitra was in it (she was in TVs The Practice and Boston Legal) and she is a hottie. Okay, so now you know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sophomoric Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With UNDERWORD: EVOLUTION in the rear-view mirror, I am hard pressed to say what it was about. A lot of bullets pierced a lot of things, ten minutes took place in medieval times, and Derek Jacobi made a speech on a boat. But that's all I can remember. At some point the memory of UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION gets tangled up with Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. And somewhere Keanu Reeves has this big smile.Selene and Michael Corbinus are the lone survivors from the first installment, I think. There were two warring clans of monsters in the first movie, but I think the war ended and they all went back to their day jobs. The two clandestine lovers are running from the law for who knows what reason, dodging bullets in one scene and trees in another. They eventually find a set of keys that have a thousand years history behind them. What do the keys open, and who's chasing them? My memory fails me here. Enter Marcus, flapping like an angry bat out of Coppola hell. He's doesn't like being woken up on a Monday. I don't blame him. Still, over the span of a thousand years he's learned to be quite a jerk, becoming what we modern day folk like to call a "homicidal maniac." You might remember him as the dessicated corpse opening his eyes at the end of the first Underworld.Let's talk about the first installment. Here's my question. For those of you who liked the first Underworld from 2003, what was it you liked? Was it the sparkly clothes or was it the huge CGI rodents? Or maybe you got sucked into the blood feud and Alex Corbinus' delinquent family members. Whatever your answer may be, those elements aren't in the sequel. The sequel plays out more like an Indiana Jones installment, except you replace all the yellow sand with blue water.So do you know the original story? Once upon a time, there was one brother bitten by bat, one by wolf, and a whole lot of actors from the Commonwealth started bickering amongst themselves. They were going to set up a welcome party for their friends, but it got derailed by a horde of disgruntled werewolves. A lot of monsters died, and a lot of blood mixing went on. But the human spirit prevailed (?)We've seen where a sequel has matched the quality of the first and surpassed it. Terminator 2 no doubt made a greater impact than the first. The Matrix: Reloaded raised the bar in special effects production for movie makers out there. Aliens offered heavy machine guns to fight off a gruesome nightmare. These are all sequels that lived up to the legacy set by the predecessor, but what would I say about UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION? I'd say let's redo it with a better story. Then the audience could get wrapped up in the elaborate chase scenes and care about the outcome. Yes, a better, in your face plot -- and why not throw in Wesley Snipes for good measure.JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like X-men, this one should go on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to watch Underworld II, I checked back on my IMDb comments on the original, as I vaguely remember that its plot was quite complicated. The synopsis I wrote then turns out to be quite useful, but not necessarily for watching the sequel, which has an entirely new plot of its own. Some loose ends from the first one were indeed tidied up, such as how Viktor came to be Selene's mentor in the first place. But before I come to all that, just a few general observations.The sequel does not have much by way of big brawls, in fact only one, happening prologue, over a thousand years ago. This big battle between the original vampires and the original werewolves is well shot, with about half a dozen of werewolf heads chopped off within a few minutes, presumably to satisfy the section of the audience that want this sort of thing, so that they can sit back quietly to watch the rest of the movie.With pouting lips, the most beautiful of vampires that ever graced this earth is back, and those who are drawn to the movie by Kate Beckinsale should be happy that they see more of her (in more ways than one) in the sequel.The exciting action is there. The Gothic charm is there. The eye-popping special effect is there. The melancholic love story is there, even with a happy ending. The climatic showdown is quite watchable ? a double duel of spouse vs brothers, neatly arranged in vampire vs vampire and werewolf vs werewolf formation. There should be enough to satisfy fans of the original Underworld. As to others, be converted or stay away.Now as I did the last time, a brief synopsis of the plot: (start of synopsis) *** spoiler warning repeated *** If you recall in the original, Viktor was awaken out of turn, ahead of Marcus, to deal with the rebellious werewolf Lucian. The sequel goes much further back, to the beginning, to account for the relationship between these two vampire leaders. Marcus was the original vampire while Viktor was a great human leader, lured by Marcus with immortality to help in the titanic fight against werewolves. And who else, but Marcus's own brother William, would be the original werewolf. (We'll meet their father too, as if two thousand-year-old monsters are not enough). When the battle was finally won, however, Viktor broke his promise to Marcus of letting him keep his brother, but instead had William imprisoned. Now all that happened a thousand years ago.What happened in the first Underworld is not that terribly essential for the sequel even though the timeline is a continuation. Marcus, a name only in the original, now materializes in a most horrendously hideous form, in a deadly race against the main characters Selene and Michael in finding the imprisoned William. If he succeeds and the brothers join force, it will end up in a power tyranny too horrible to contemplate. The plot, therefore, is not that complicated, just a linear chase, through three rather key characters, to unravel and get to the William's prison. Along the way, we also learn Selene's history, how she became a vampire.(end of synopsis) Like X-men, Underworld: Evolution is a sequel that is at least as good, and probably better, than the original, leaving the audience hoping for a third one. The betrayer Kraven who escaped at the end of the original played no part at all in the sequel, most likely exactly for that purpose - saved for Underworld III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory and dark, but hardly eerie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is a new (sub)genre, you know. Action movies disguised as horror movies. After "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" and "Van Helsing", this is the latest example. We get the vampires and the werewolves, the gore and the darkness, but there is no eerie, creepy atmosphere when Kate reloads the guns and fires at everything that moves. Her role has more in common with Stallone's Rambo than Lugosi's Dracula. Derek Jacobi ("Hamlet", "Gladiator") brings in a bit of story interest as a father who cannot control his children. Tragedy succumbs to stunts and FX too quickly, though. Thus the viewers' interest in the characters vanishes, and all we will remember from the movie is its beautiful shades of blue, that is was fun to watch (fair enough), and Kate is one hot chick. I expected a little bit more, because the story of the first movie, full of treachery and unexpected turns, should have been continued with an equally complex sequel. I voted 7/10 for the sequel compared to 8/10 for the first one.</fullReview>

The Underworld series deviates from the mainstream thought of what vampiric behaviour ought to be. This could be a pro or a con, depending on the individual, but being more of a fan of the original style, I would have preferred some more sword play.Having criticized this show for its intelligence level, less than traditional approach to vampires and werewolves, and unnecessary gore, I will say that to its benefit, its a damn good movie to watch after a tough day on the job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld:Evolution is without question one of the top action horror movies in the past five years. Tons of amazing action sequences shot by a director who understands the genre and how to make them look good. There are no crazy close-ups with music video editing which exist in so many other films purely to cover up how weak the fight choreography and special effects are. Not in Evolution. They are shot so professionally and executed seamlessly. There is tons of gore and over the top followed by even more over the top death and destruction! And the great thing is that the story (no matter how unbelievable) is actually quite enthralling. Lots of back story in terms of the history of werewolves and vampires and how they came to exist etc. etc. Kate Beckinsale could be the hottest chick in Hollywood. Solid acting, great special effects, superb cinematography (check out the lighting in several scenes) and extremely precise and well timed editing. This movie by far surpasses the original. Sure there are some continuity problems but big deal. A must for horror and action fans alike. AND THOSE OF YOU WHO THOUGHT THAT KATE BECKINSALE SPINNING AND SHOOTING THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE ORIGINAL WAS COOL, CHECK OUT "NEMESIS" WHICH UNDERWORLD RIPPED OFF AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING MUCH MUCH COOLER!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The war between Vampire and Lycan continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the darkness of the world, a war rages that most of humanity does not know exists. Vampire and Lycan, both immortal with powers beyond that of humans, have fought for hundreds of years in order to dominate each other. Underworld (2003) introduced us to this war and its main factions along with the players who control this feud. Underworld Evolution continues on with the story with the explanation of how this war started and how how it may end.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) have escaped both the vengeance of Viktor (Bill Nighy) and the plotting of Kraven (Shane Brolly). Two of the vampire elders are dead leaving the original, and most powerful of the vampires, alive. The accidental awakening of Marcus (Tony Curran) threatens not just their lives, but also the existence of all of humanity.The hunt is now on for both Selene and Michael. But what they don't know is that Marcus is not only after then, but also his long lost twin brother William (Brian Steele) who is the father of the Lycans and the most powerful. Marcus believes he can bring reason and control over his brother and create a new world. However, he must find him and only Selene knows the location of his exile.Also the story of Corvinus (Derek Jacobi), the father of Marcus and William, is reveled. He has remained immortal as his sons have though he lives as a normal human would. Observing and watching from the distance as Vampire and Lycan tore each other apart throughout the years. Determined to 'clean up the mess' after the both of them while remaining as far from each as possible. Through Corvinus, Selene is forced to look through her past to the days when she was still human. In facing the past, she discovers not only the location of William, but also the reason her family was murdered and why she was turned by Viktor. Her family alone knew the location of William and Viktor, the one who claimed to have 'rescued' Selene, was determined that no one else would.What made the original Underworld so excellent continues here. A complex mythic past surrounded by mystery drives the story while Selene and Michael are allowed to struggle with what remains of their humanity. Though they are no longer fully human, neither one is determined to lose that one part that does remain mortal. Free from the hunger, rage, and loss that curses both Vampire and Lycan. It is this ability to hold onto the shreds of humanity that separates them from either side and, in the end, allows them to defeat both Marcus and William after one final stand.The story is not over yet. Selene has gained new powers from Corvinus after taking his blood before his own death which have given back more of her 'humanity'. There is still darkness to confront and both Vampire and Lycan still battle. Selen and Michael may be the only ones who can finally end it.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am quite a fan of the first movie, and I liked the sequel too. It was a direct continuation of the first, with several new layers added. The whole thing was one long moody and bloody action movie, nearly perfectly recapturing the mood from the first movie. The acting itself was a bit more intense in the first movie, I thought, while the sequel was perhaps slightly too fast-paced to give the characters much room.The one thing where I felt the sequel fell short of my expectations was a part of the central plot. Underworld: Evolution was exciting and engaging, with much more and much deeper story than in the average action movie, but one of the key points did not satisfy. They spend almost the whole second half of the movie trying to locate the sarcophagus of the first werewolf. This is exciting, because you expect that something wild and interesting will happen when they find it. But... they find it, release the guy, fight him for a couple of minutes and kill him. That's it. Except for the fight, he doesn't have any real role to play in the story. That was a let-down. And a serious one.But other than that I was quite satisfied. It was cool to see all that British talent, lending a touch of real class to the project!My rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a horrible movie. It has a couple of exciting moments but the director isn't good at directing action scenes. He's very good at showing Kate Beckinsale shoot her weapons and then reload them. It's a watered down version of T2 or Aliens or any sci-fi classic we've seen before. The film is confusing as it takes place right after the last one. I forgot pretty much everything from the last one so it was sort of helpful. The film just doesn't develop the way it could have. There were some cool things that could have been done like the ultimate werewolf should have been in the movie more. Let him loose, have fun with this. It's too focused on telling the story from the last film to this film. And I hate it when bad guys kill other bad guys. You're only as good as your villain and if he's killing characters that your hero should kill, then what's left for your hero?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It delivers the goods (SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Underworld movies are like a modern day version of the old Hammer productions, with Christopher Lee as Dracula and Peter Cushing as Van Helsing, or any other vampire hunter of the day. I'm not saying that they're similar in style, or anything of that kind, but they do serve the same cultural purpose. They occupy the same space in pop culture. Underworld Evolution has maybe some plot holes regarding Marcus, the main villain, plan, which one can only hope for his sake that it's clearer in his head, than it is on screen. And it suffers a bit from Scott Speedman being a weak co-star. His character barely register, and as a result is hard to really care for the love story between him and the beautiful vampire Selene. You accept it, but there's no real emotional involvement in it. But the flaws end here. The movie remains a fun, dark ride and a real guilty pleasure. There's authentic love in the way the movie mythology is fleshed out, there are impressive visuals (Marcus in his vampire form, with those wings that can become deadly weapons, is something to see), and while Kate Beckinsale obviously has not much to do acting wise, she does inhabit her character better than in the previous film. She seems more at ease with it, and she makes for a nice heroine. The film also ends on a vaguely romantic note which is quite nice. There's not much else to find in Underworld: Evolution, but the movie is good genre fun, and it's all it wants to be. Just like a good old Hammer production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution is nothing more than an action flick with gore and sex. It's almost exactly like the original. Kate Beckinsale is back in her tight leather suit that she wears throughout the entire movie. There is plenty of action, with a nice amount of gore added in.The storyline is pretty slim. At the start we go back to the start where we meet the first vampire and lycan. Who just happen to be brothers. Marcus (vampire) is looking for his William (lycan) who is out of control. We see that William has been captured. Go to present and Selene is trying to untangle all that we learnt from the first Underworld.Don't see this movie if you didn't like the original or want something more than just action, sex, a little bit of storyline, action, action and more action. I enjoyed this for it's no brainer entertaining value. The acting is average and the storyline is slim. I think we can all expect a third installment in the coming year.3?/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a sequel, Evolution delivers at least as well as, say, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and as a movie it is royalty compared to poor, shamed Aeon Flux.Here's my Good, Bad and Ugly... GOOD 1. I could watch Kate Beckinsale as long as anybody could. It's a contest I would enter.2. Direction, cinematography, editing--all immerse you successfully in Underworld again, and the several new locations expand it admirably.3. The battle on the truck is superb action film-making.4. I could watch Kate Beckinsale naked as long as anybody could...5. In fact, until Selene and Michael reach Corvinus' ship, any complaints are almost so minor as to be ignored.6. Costumes and effects have improved.7. You can see the extra $35 million on the screen (over Underworld's budget).BAD 1. The excellent Budapest locations that budget forced Len Wiseman to use in Underworld made the built Vancouver sets of Evolution look at times like cheap Disney in comparison. You can't buy real iron curtain dilapidation (on their budget, anyway).2. Kate's talent and potential are either suppressed or just ignored. She's an excellent Selene, again, but we see no transformation--physical, mental or spiritual--when she becomes a god. The only slack to be given is that maybe they're saving it for the last installment.3. What the hell does it MEAN that Michael is a hybrid of two immortal races anyway? In Underworld, we apparently created the most powerful being in the universe. In the beginning of Evolution, he's confused and still wants potatoes. No problem. But even after 90 minutes, all it means is "oh, yeah, your a hybrid", and he jumps fast and hits hard. I think there was a bunny rabbit that could do that, too.UGLY 1. WTF happened to those ULTRAVIOLET BULLETS!? What a cheat to have introduced such a cool concept with such massive story potential, and then do absolutely nothing with it. It's the single best effect in both movies, and we see it only once, in the first 10 minutes of Underworld! How about instead of Selene just blithely out-fisting Marcus in the finale (okay, so the helicopter WAS cool), she is on her last breath, Marcus having double-skewered her, when she spies one of the ultraviolet shells glowing in the water... she eyes it, smirks knowingly for once and shoves it into his skull? How hard is that to think up? I mean, she is the baddest ass in the universe, right? Surely that would finally give her a sense of humor.2. Ditto the silver nitrates. Please... "all we've got are these ultraviolets"? Especially when we ALL know William is loose before we leave the ship? We hear that William is a hybrid as well. Maybe the nitrates DON'T WORK ON HIM! OH, SH*T!! 3. How about Selene gives some of that new god juice to lover boy to wake him up, so he doesn't just fly coach in a body bag to the finale and suddenly "wake up" for no reason (deux es what?)? Or, even better, revive him with her regular unleaded, so he can contribute to the Corvinus scene. Then wait until William has pummeled him to HIS last breath, after Selene has just lit up Marcus, and she crawls and shoves her premium-grade arm into Michael's mouth. As the spinach takes hold, Popeye leaps up and dissects William, his parts flying in all directions. Did they run out of money or just imagination in the last 20 minutes of this movie?! As always (read my Aeon Flux comment), it's the missed glory in the writing that saddens me, because excellence of story rarely costs you anything more in production. So much of this movie worked, and worked most of the way.Endings are tough. Hell, any good writing is tough. But if nothing else, in action-horror you can exaggerate everything 50% and pay off your coolest ideas in the last 15 minutes, and your audience leaves satisfied. The first 80 minutes, no matter how good, are wasted if you don't.Based on the box office so far, I would say that lousy last 15 minutes cost at least $5 million per in the theaters.But if you liked Underworld, you should see Evolution, and on balance you may think it's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Measures up to the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Underworld with very low expectations and being pleasantly surprised, I made the mistake of raising my expectations for this film. I honestly couldn't get through Evolution the first time I tried. However, by the second time, my expectations had descended back down to a rational level.Evolution continues the story of Selene - renegade vampire enforcer - and Michael - the first vampire/lycan hybrid as they attempt to discover the secrets that vampires and lycans all over the world are dying for. They find themselves at cross-purposes with the legendary Marcus - the most powerful and oldest vampire alive - who is seeking to free his lycan brother William from thousands of years of imprisonment.The film has a different feeling from the original. It is exceedingly fast-paced, more fantastic and special effects-oriented, and less merciful. Underworld Evolution establishes a fitful pace early on, and uses nihilistic - almost random - violence to establish the central problem at the beginning. The special effects are good, the action scenes are very good (and less Matrix-influenced than the original) and the cinematography and directing are a touch above the original. The performances were generally very good. Curran, Jakobi and Beckinsale were outstanding. Speedman is better than he was in Underworld, but he remained a little unconvincing.I was thoroughly entertained. My only criticism is that the creators may have tried to cram too much into this film. But nonetheless,it all holds together pretty well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Blue. Light blue. Dark blue. Midnight blue. Blue, blue, blue.Have I mentioned how B-L-U-E this movie is? Somewhere, somehow, someone got it into their heads that the way to convey to an audience that this film takes place primarily at night was to make every shot a wash of bluish-gray. Seriously, every single shot in the whole movie. The cameraman must have run down to the local Blue Lens Filter Mart and just bought them out. I can hear the director now, yelling at his lighting crew: "What??? Hey, there's a trace of color in this shot that is not blue! You're fired!" It was probably supposed to be surreal or nightmarish, but instead the sameness of it all just made me kind of sleepy.In addition to its unrelentingly monochromatic palette, this turkey has an unrelentingly monochromatic heroine, an unrelentingly monochromatic hero, and an unrelentingly monochromatic villain. That's not a death knell in the usually stark two-dimensional action-thriller genre, but in addition we get the fact that every character is dressed in black bondage gear, making them physically, as well as psychologically, indistinguishable. The fight scenes are thus rendered stale, even more so once we realize, about halfway through the first reel, that our heroine is so ridiculously skilled and super-powered that absolutely nothing can possibly threaten her. All possible tension in this "thriller" is therefore leeched away well before we get to the hackneyed plot. Sleep-inducing stuff indeed, and a grave disappointment after the first film's superior quality.Blue.It's all just...blue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The moment I finished watching the UNDERWORLD Part One, I'm surprised by it. I think it's much smarter to describe a underworld of vampires and werewolves than let Alien fight against Predator. The stories are great. Kate's role is as cool as Carrie Anne Moss's part in MATIRX.But this movie disappointed me a little bit. The director had chance to make these movies as classic as Terminaters part one and two, he didn't grasp it. Although Underworld: Evolution has better pictures than part one, the story can't give us new thought. And we can see the director tyied to give us a movie interspersed with romantic story between tow species, he failed to make the story attractive. Also sometimes the plot is a little unreasonable, luckily they're acceptable.The list of this movie includes Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedaman(his part in LOVE ACTUALLY is so funny, it's a pity if you don't check it)they're my favorite. I also like the particular heroine the movie brings us. Anyway. enjoy it.</fullReview>

Kate Beckinsale looked incredible as usual and Scott Speedman definitely had his body in shape. I think Len Wiseman could've done a lot better job with this one.At the beginning, I was confused with the time frame, I spent most of the first 15 minutes or so trying to figure out if it was a flashback or present time. There were too many plot holes and things that just didn't make sense, even after the movie was over.It was OK for two hours on a rainy Saturday afternoon but after seeing the first one I must say my expectations were left mostly unfulfilled.I still haven't figured out if it was left open for the possibility of a third movie.

		<fullReview>i was really looking forward to watch this movie and i was definitely not disappointed. The story about the struggle between vampires and werewolves is a nice theme (creates a really fine atmosphere), though the focus in both movies is definitely on the action sequences. So there is no real depth in the story ... in 3 hours (first and second movie) you could tell a lot more about the whole "universe"... But the action scenes are really good; not stunning or breathtaking but fine.So if you are looking for a good and stylish action movie you are on the right track.NOTE: i really recommend to watch the first movie first; otherwise you could have some problems to follow the storyline. underworld:evolution is, in my opinion, not a standalone movie. Both, first and second one, belong together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it pretty much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did enjoy the history they put in this one. I would have liked to delve deeper into the creation of William and Marcus and I love the historical costumes and time period better then modern day. I did dislike them killing off Craven I think he could have been of more use.I adore Scott Speedman, but how many movies is he going to have to do before he quits being a fledgling. I had hoped he would have learned more of what he could do instead of getting his butt whipped and learning the hard way. But then again in move time it was like the 'next day' where the last film left off.I do think they showed too much of Kate considering they had a wonderful cast of male actors. I missed Lucian he added a majestic realism to the Lycan. They made them comical and it was sad because wolves are very proud and loyal beast. I didn't see that camaraderie in this one. I would have thought Michael would have been their new Alpha and lead them were Lucian left off, considering the ones that lived in the last one did not try to kill him at the end. It's a shame they drop the ball on aspect.Marcus was wasted as a man, they kept him a beast too long and shifting into the bat-beast to much; made me feel more like he was a demon then a vampire, even though he was a new hybrid. I would have made Marcus one of the the good guys to help Selene to aid in creating a peaceful new race and allowed Craven to live and have him in control of the old order and to release William thinking he could control him only to find out he was wrong. I think it would have worked out better because Marcus should have been allied with Michael and they'd work towards building peace between the races. After all Michael was a blood descendant of Marcus and William that is why he was able to become a hybrid.I could understand Marcus hating his Father and wanting him to die for what happened to William, but it wasn't like Marcus had been sleep the entire time his brother was locked up. He created Viktor so why put up with him at all much less allowing him to rule even over him a true born. So to me that made him as weak as his father and he didn't have the right to be angry over what he had set in motion by giving Viktor power.Well too bad creative options aren't open to fans before the screenplay is written. I would like to see another one, only because I love the concept of Lycans and Vampires. But less blood and gore cause after awhile it numbs you. The only time you need all that blood and gore is when you don't have faith in your own story and characters. It's a form of cinema distraction. As a fantasy writer when you join these to forms creatures it's their dark eloquence that make them unforgettable. Brutality is use only in there need to survive.Why waste the bullets if what you trying to kill can't be killed that way? Can you say gun overkill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the first one was bad. This one achieves the impossible by not only surpassing the sheer foulness of the first but making it actually look good in comparison! In this masterpiece of trash, Selene and Michael go off in search of their origins and the origins of lycans and vampires and to keep the first vampire from hooking up with the first werewolf. There's some pressing need for all of this, but truth be told, it eludes me. We get some painfully bad dialog that's supposed to make us care and then are treated to a bunch of dumb looking critters that must have sprung from the mind of a toy company exec.There is even more CGI in this than the first. There is even more pitifully executed wire work in this than the first. And it still hasn't gotten any brighter. Yes, I know, Selene will burst into flame if she sees sunlight, but come on, adequate lighting wouldn't hurt - although it may reveal the sub-par acting everyone seems to be telegraphing in for this movie.It's not the worst out there, but it's pretty darned close.One out of ten.</fullReview>

Everyone knows that's not going to do anything, wouldn't you think the main characters, a vampire and a vampire/werewolf hybrid would know it?

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this movie was made, if not for squeezing some cash from a nice idea. The first one held no expectations: it was an enjoyable action flick with a cool heroine that introduced us to a redesign of vampire/werewolf lore, with a lot of potential for a movie. It was a Blade-like movie but without the character building introspection. Even though this was truly exploited, I'm sure everyone was expecting another movie which would build on that. Now that movie is here and to save on typing, it trashes the whole original. Basically it rips apart any potential for a story in favor of some action blended with a 'love' scene-wannabe. If you're looking for some extension of the first one, or for some added vampire lore or any story whatsoever, or if you like the first one, you're better off without Evolution. The whole vampire mythology introduced in Underworld is reduced here to a cheesy half-love story between a vampire and a werewolf-vampire hybrid facing another mutant of sorts in a non-stop action that shoves brief explanations of the so-called plot down the viewer's throat without respect or logic in a classic Uwe Boll style. The movie is more of a 5/10 but I gave it a 3/10 just for mocking the original.</fullReview>

When its comes down to sum the plot i don't have to do much: Big ugly powerful villain wants to free big ugly raging beast and has to be stopped.So the main characters rush form one fighting scene to the other.I was very disappointed because the makers Underworld Evolution did not use its full potential. If you are looking for some vampire and werewolf stories you will get mindless splatter and shooting and even those will get boring in the end.If you are into special effects and fighting you might like the film, but do not expect it to be a worthy successor of Underworld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, the wondrous world of the Vampire descends upon the modern audience. However, if filmmakers are to succeed in this dark genera, the ingredients must be sufficient to capture and hold the attention of an increasingly sophisticated viewer. Thus any attempt to hold an audience today must not be aimed at the adult, but at the terrifying nightmare world of the child. Spare the incredible and you lose your audience. Underworld, The Evolution, has done just that. It fires the imagination with a Gothic story which spans centuries and synthesizes it with the latest in special effects and modern weaponry. The Result, a superb, action-driven and utterly fantastic film which entreats and then terrifies the curious and medieval child in each of us. Adding to the darkly savage, high speed, bullet-ripping landscape is the rare appearance and over the top performance of Sir Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus. He is aptly aided by Tony Curran and Scott Speedman as his sons, Michael and Marcus Corvinus. Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene. Together, they weave a black tapestry of blood, betrayal and vengeance which dates to the Roman era. The entire cast refines the blood-sucking, throat slashing and nightmarish, but evolutionary saga of the legendary Vampire and Werewolf. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I don't think that i've seen such a good sequel in a long time! I think that it was nice to see that Selene and Michael hadn't lost that "romeo and Juliet" style touch. But I gotta say, the action was so much better in this film. I'm a fan of the first film for its creativity in the storyline, and actual acting, but to me the first film was too plain. I'm glad to see that Len Wiseman has actually stepped up the mark for that area. It was great to see Selene back in that leather outfit and kicking Markus's ass, and doing it in style. The thing that i think was underdone was when Michael "died". I think that they should have made Selene to be so much more upset then she appeared to be.Other than that, i thought the medieval thing at the start was great, but i would've liked to see more of it. I thought the sets were awesome, and the costumes were still pretty good, although i think they should have gone a little more Gothic like the first movie then they did. Apart from a few silly goofs with costumes and props, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie, even if you're not so into the Gothic vampire thing.If you enjoy this kind of "chick flick" action/horror movies, then you should probably give "Resident Evil" a go. Or if you're just into the vampire action movies try "Interview with a Vampire", Blade I or II, or "Queen of the Damned".Any of these I definitely recommend seeing. But as for "Underworld: Evolution" goes, its a must see on my list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very cool vampire vs werewolf film. I really liked the first one, as it gave a new storyline to how vampires &amp; werewolves came to exist. But,the sequel, which goes way back into the past to show how the 2 creatures vendetta came to be born, was just awesome! Kate Beckinsale is the best action heroine since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, &amp; she kicks ass in a major believable way! Scott Speedman's hybrid is everything I anticipated, though i kinda wish he would've had a cooler look to him. I really liked that they dropped down on the romance element &amp; focused more on the war between the vampires &amp; the lycans. All of the new characters were a lot more intense then the first film, though I did miss the character of the Lycan leader Lucien, as Michael Sheen was great in the first film. I loved how Scott Speedman's character Michael, would grab the werewolves &amp; just ripped their snouts &amp; jaws wide open. Also,it had a lot better gore scenes than the first as this one is gory. I really appreciate any film that can recreate the vampire mythos. Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV series), Anne Rice's novels, &amp; the upcoming film Nightwatch have all done it so much differently from the Bram Stoker story, that to me the newer versions of vampires &amp; their creations, is entertaining &amp; in some cases really genius in story-telling. And,it's about time some one tackled the werewolves origin, as usually it's just a story or a film, where a man/woman are just bitten &amp; they just have to deal with the curse or side-effects. Underworld 2:Evolution is a way cool film.if you haven't seen the original, you'll be a little lost, so you may want to check it out first, but then if you like it enough to want to continue to the sequel, be prepared to be blown away. best vampire sequel I've seen since Blade 2:Bloodlust. **** out *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surpasses the first film, and as good as a sequel to 'Underworld' could be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Underworld was not as good as it clearly thought it was, but it's an entertaining flick - and in my view at least, good enough for a sequel. Subtitled 'Evolution', (having numbers after the title for a sequel is now out of fashion), this second instalment builds on the original film; while still finding the time for enough action to please it's target audience. Surprisingly for a boisterous action-horror flick, Len Wiseman's second film is more restrained than you would think. Although there are plenty of action sequences, the focus is put more firmly on the plot; and this ensures that the film isn't merely a dull collection of stunts. The film starts off with a great sequence, which goes back to the beginning of the war between the Lycans and the Vampires. We then follow Selene (Beckinsale) and Michael (Speedman), both now on the run after dispatching vampire elder Viktor (Nighy). We follow the pair as they trace their origins and try to ensure that the first ever vampire, Marcus, isn't able to free his brother William; the first of the werewolves.One of the major reasons I enjoyed the first film was due to its leather-clad female lead. The sexy Kate Beckinsale reprises her role under the direction of her husband, and is every bit the sassy heroine that a film like this needs. Underworld: Evolution, like the original film, makes best use of this asset! The acting here is a more than a little bit corny overall; but Beckinsale and the rest of the cast do their jobs well enough to ensure that the film doesn't completely fall down on the acting side. The special effects are good, with the werewolves being particularly of note for being impressive. Werewolves don't often translate to the screen well; but they look just fine in this film! The visuals are dark and Gothic, and look absolutely stunning. As with the first film, the glossy style bodes well with the action scenes and ensures that the film is pleasing to the eye. The best thing about the film for me, however, was the mythology surrounding the war between werewolves and vampires. It's portrayed well, and Wiseman leaves enough gaps to keep the interest, while ensuring that the plot builds to a complete whole by the time the credits role.On the whole, Evolution is a better film than the original. It builds on the first film, and delivers enough new elements to make it interesting to anyone who liked the original. This is the sort of film that wont be remembered long after it's over - but it makes for a great time while watching, and comes highly recommend to horror/action fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution (5/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution had so, so much potential and it's really a downer that the film didn't provide the quality of story that the first Underworld possessed. There were way too many characters in the movie and the role of William as a major part and theme of the film without having a focal character is just really petty when it comes to the flow and understanding of the story. The best part of the film, sadly enough, was the sex scene, where Kate Beckinsale was incredible and really animalistic. From that point forward the story seemed to stretch in its believability and the film gradually added plot hole after plot hole until a point where the ridiculousness was off the charts. The vampire and werewolf action and gore was still well done similarly to the first but that is one of the few things Evolution had going for it. The movie is pretty avoidable, maybe just a onetime watch is all its worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid follow on from the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens eight hundred years ago as we see an early battle between vampires and lycans; it ends with the capture of William, the first lycan, by his brother, Marcus the first vampire, and Victor. We then return to the present; moments after the previous film ended. Selene is on the run with hybrid Michael but decides she must return to mansion before Kraven and kill Marcus? it turns out that by the time she gets there Marcus has killed Kraven. Marcus is determined to find and free his brother William; something that would be disastrous for the world as he and those he turns are unable to take human form so are always vicious creatures. Selene and Michael are determined to stop him.Before watching this film it is highly advisable that you watch opening film first as little time is wasted explaining who is who or what is going on. If you watched and enjoyed the first film you are almost certain to enjoy this as it is at least as good if not slightly better. There is plenty of exciting action throughout the film as well as a fairly solid story. The cast does a fine job; Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene and Scott Speedman impresses as Michael? his character is definitely more interesting now he has become the hybrid. Derek Jacobi is a fine addition as Corvinus; the first immortal and father of Marcus and William. On the down side some of the CGI shows its age a bit but thankfully not enough to spoil my enjoyment of the film. The ending nicely wraps up the story before hinting at more to come. Overall I'd say this was a pretty good film that fans of the franchise are sure to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ghastly hue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Computer-generated fur and fangs. Not fun to watch. Read something like that. Valid points. Movie looks like it has been filmed inside a freezer. That is the whole point, of course, but that ghastly monochromatic hue affects everything, the world doesn't look like this at all. Thankful!Two things. It's awe-inspiring x1000. There is no denying that. And Kate Beckinsale is amazingly beautiful, the fragile vulnerability of her delicately chiseled face, paired with those ice-blue eyes, offset by the raging tornado inside the character. These two things nobody could argue.The movie suffers from being just as inhuman and cold as its predecessor. As a character, the viewer had no feelings for Selene or Michael. There is no character involvement, they do not make themselves likable, they are coldly distanced from us, we see that they act like heroes, and prefer them to that other horrible lot, of course, but that doesn't make them likable.A third thing to mention, as for 'the king of vampires' in that scene with the truck - learned on the DVD commentary that the scene was considered as something to be thrown out, too expensive for the budget. Glad they didn't, that scene is magnificent!The bleakest magnum opus ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to cult fave Underworld (2003) finds vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and half werewolf Michael (Scott Speedman) unravelling the truth about their respective blood lines. Just what caused the feud between the vampires and the lycans?Unsurprisingly reviews for this sequel are mixed, it's either a smart action popcorner that was warranted, or it's a huge let down after the first film. Personally I'm in the first camp, personally because it does pretty much the same things, only the story has a bit of complexity about it to try and bluff us that it's cerebral.For a film about vampires and werewolves at war it delivers all that is required in the modern era. There's lots of high energy action, blood and guts galore, CGI overdrive, fast pacing and a sexy lead actress fronting the piece. The story ticks along nicely, introducing new and interesting characters, while flashbacks fill in the gaps for any newcomers to the series. The main villain is one bad-ass winged mofo, a genuine terror that our protagonists have right to fear, and the finale is as expected a bonkers array of bloody chaos.Smartly put together by director Len Wiseman and coolly photographed by Simon Duggan (steel blues and greys), it isn't ground breaking cinema, but it's a wail of a time for those with expectation levels set at popcorn bonanza. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evolution of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did watch the first Underworld many years ago and I didn't care for it at the time but overtime I thought I would give the series another chance. All watching all four films I figure I start reviewing the sequels one film at a time.So now we move onto Underworld:Evolution which I might consider my favorite in the Underworld series and here's why.The plot of the film picks up where the first one left off centering around Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run while also being hunted by Marcus (Tony Curran). We also get to learn about the history of the two factions. The writers made it work so those new to the series could better understand Also the action scenes in this film were very well balance and original for the film which could make it a stronger film in the series as some had said.The Music in the film sets the tone to match it to each scene. The score brings the emotion out in the characters which you could actually feel for them not all films can say that. The tension in the film you could cut it with a knife and the performances of the cast helps make it feel that way. The film just has a lot to make a enjoyable film and actually a strong sequel So if you're a fan of Vampire and werewolf films you will enjoy this one with tension throughout, good score and a character driven story this film is not one to be missedI give Underworld: Evolution an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger is not necessarily better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale is back for more vampire/werewolf shenanigans. Underworld: Evolution picks up right where the first film left off. If you haven't seen that first film do so. This sequel tries to give you a Cliff Notes recap of what happened in the first film. But honestly if you haven't seen the first one you may be a little lost here. And you'd want to see that first film anyway because quite frankly that one was better than this one.So where were we? Beckinsale's Selene, still of course shoehorned into that body-hugging catsuit, is a vampire whose job is to kill werewolves. But now she's on the run with Michael, who's a vampire-werewolf hybrid. And Selene is kind of falling in love with Michael. Does this make any sense? Again, hope you watched that first movie. Meanwhile, vampire elder Marcus has gotten some wolf blood and is now a really ticked-off hybrid, flying around like a very angry bat. Marcus is coming after Selene and Michael. He's after something. That something turns out to be a pendant. This is apparently the most important pendant in the history of the world. Why? Well, we'll get to that later. First we've got a bunch of action sequences to get through. Bat-man Marcus and wolf-man Michael square off in all their CGI glory. There's more wolves, more vampires, more blood, more death and destruction. This movie had a much bigger budget than the first one and it's easy to see where the money went. It's a visual effects bonanza. Everything is bigger this time around. But bigger is not necessarily better.Let's be honest, this whole story is rather silly. Vampires and werewolves slaughtering one another. But in that first movie the story, silly though it may have been, was engaging, compelling and even somewhat charming. The backstory was very well worked-out, it was a silly movie but it had some smarts to it. This time out charm and smarts are in much shorter supply. This is just a big action movie like so many other big action movies you have seen. This one just happens to involve vampires and werewolves. Beckinsale gives it a game effort again, building this franchise around her paid off very well. She kicks butt. This time she gets to show real emotion as well. And she certainly looks the part, who else would you rather see in that skin-tight catsuit? Scott Speedman is back as Michael. He has less actual acting to do than he did in the first movie. Now he just has to be big and strong and smash stuff. Which he does well enough I suppose. Tony Curran has his moments playing Marcus but all in all that character is bit of a problem. He's way over-the-top. Menacing to be sure but often cartoonishly so. This movie has a lot of action, and that action looks really good. The movie is shot beautifully, if a little darkly, and the visual effects are utterly convincing. But the action to story ratio is skewed way too far in the direction of action. It's a reasonably enjoyable watch for anyone who enjoyed the first movie. But there's little doubt you'll have enjoyed the first movie more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the possible exceptions of Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, it's widely regarded that all sequels to horror/sci-fi films are of inferior quality to the original. However, I think that Underworld 2 (or 'Evolution' as it's better known) is actually at least on a par with the original.For a start the same creative team was behind it (which always helps), the story picks up right where its predecessor left off and it actually expands the whole Underworld universe.Whether you like this or not will largely depend on whether you liked the original. It's not as if they just re-did the original script, but it's such a continuation, you really need to watch the films in order for you to fully get the importance of this one.One downside which people kept making was how this second outing constantly uses flashbacks in order to recap the story from the first one. I guess this is just for those who are watching this film without seeing the first.However, assuming you've watched and enjoyed the first, you really can't go wrong with the second - you have more action, more vampires and werewolves (none of which twinkle in sunlight!) and Kate Beckinsale in more rubber (but that's probably only a plus point for the guys).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always the same question you'll find yourself asking, when it comes to sequels. You know it's going to be bigger, but does that mean it's going to be better? At least this isn't really bad though. You get the same actors that played their respective roles (and survived) the first Underworld movie. That means you get a very stunning and beautiful Kate Beckinsale again! It's not so much the story that will interest you here though, but the action. And this I can tell you, is well shot. Plus even the small amount of story gets treated in a nice fashion here (the fact it's a real sequel should please you). Of course after this came a prequel, before they continued the story in 2011/2012 (though I'm guessing the forth one might be the last one too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a surprisingly superior sequel and mercifully shorter, 'Underworld: Evolution' (7/10 Stars) wasn't perfect, but it was a breath of fresh air over the over-long original. Sad we were still subjected to the dreadful (character) Viktor and an outrageously and hilariously bad use of CGI in the opening prequel. But good that we still had the ass-kicking Selene. She's worth the entire viewing and even her sidekick/lover Michael did a bang up job himself. The score, action and soundtrack are all good and it's not as heavy handed with the ancient mystery as the first was. It's recommended, especially over the first and definitely over the horror that follows it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saga Continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins at where the previous film ended, though there is a prologue set hundreds of years before where we are given a glimpse of the beginnings of the conflict between the werewolves and the vampires. We learn that the lines come from two brothers, one was bitten by a bat and the other bitten by a wolf, and as such they were cursed with their respective curses. You do hear of their father, but he is apparently in the background at this stage, and doesn't really seem (at this time) to be a major part of the film.The main theme that I noticed in this film is the extent of the brotherly bond, and the father-son bond. It was almost as if the idea was taken from the bible namely where King David refuses to lay a hand of violence upon his son Absolom, despite Absolom having usurped his throne and waged a war against him. It is only when Absolom is found by some of David's men that he is slain, and even then David mourns bitterly at his loss, and has to be rebuked by his men for behaving in such an atrocious manner.There are similarities here (yes the father does make an appearance, and appears to be immortal, but it is unclear what it is that makes him immortal since he was neither bitten by a bat or a wolf) in that despite his sons running rampant across the world, causing chaos and destruction, he refuses to lay a finger on them. Further, despite the bother (the Lycan) being a ravenous beast, the other brother, once again, refuses to lay a hand of vengeance on him. While this is not the brother's downfall, it is the father's, and it is tragic in a sense because the father, through his refusal to discipline his sons, becomes a victim of their outrage.The makers of the film were sued by White Wolf (makers of the Vampire and Werewolf Roleplaying Games) for breach of copyright. This, in my opinion, is ridiculous. While there were a couple of instances where I could say that yes, that was taken from White Wolf, I would hardly call it a breach of copyright. To me it simply looked like a way to cash in on the movies' success, without actually doing anything to earn it (other than sue the film makers). As the matter settled confidentially out of court, it is just one more aspect of this matter that suggests that White Wolf's claim was quite spurious, and the only reason they reached an out of court settlement was that it would have been too expensive to run to trial (which is one of the tactics plaintiffs use to attempt to extort money from defendants).</fullReview>

The special affects are great , as you would expect and the colors are what make this film so watchable. Lots of blue , white and black and on Blue ray this looks outstanding. The storyline is fairly easy to understand and an added bonus is that Steven Mackintosh has a small role which makes up for the fact that Bill Nighy is only in the movie just at the beginning. If there are any minus points , they are that Tony Curran is not as good as Michael Sheen was in the the first film and I'm still not totally convinced about Scott Speedman as Michael. They both lack personality. But never mind because Kate Beckinsale and her PVC makes up for all that !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i saw the first Underworld, i loved it, it was my fav vampire movie and i just loved the violence and gore. This new entry into the saga of Underworld in my opinion is the weakest of the three. I saw this one expecting something more better then the first one, when it was over, i realized it wasn't all that great. The acting in this movie is good, theirs no fault in it, but the fault lies in the story, it wasn't very developed like people were probably hoping for. i felt like their wasn't enough action and the villain was just plain stupid, his design isn't even convincing, it was just a waste of time to even include him since he wasn't the all mighty vampire they claimed he was. Overall, i gave the movie its low rating because overall, it could have been so much more better then it was, but it wasn't. Even Rise of the Lycans was more enjoyable for me, although the first will always be my favorite. So yea, its worth seeing once maybe, but after once, probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Underworld: Evolution is the best of the trilogy! I'm sorry if people think differently, but this is what I think. For instance, I like how Selene and Michael become more closer together and when Michael dies for a while, it makes me think about the tragedy that Selene had to live with. I have seen TV/film couples ending in death or disaster, but I was amazed when I saw Michael back from the dead! I like the scene when Kraven dies because I absolutely HATE Kraven! In the first film, he was snobbish, fascist and hungry for power and Selene. Kraven is the most despised character in Underworld and I saw why in the first film. Overall, Underworld: Evolution is better than all the other films.</fullReview>

We got a taste of what it is to fight w/ the "lesser" lycans &amp; then when we finally get to meet William. He just takes all the heat. No CG stuff spent on him. It all went to his brother Marcus. Thought they treated Marcus well overall w/ the effects except the one scene where he was slowly floating around the truck in the chase scene.

		<fullReview>More of the same, post-Matrix, supernatural nighttime action. I think that the special effects and editing are notably better in this sequel though and there is a very good minimum standard of acting across the board. There's also less Gothic fetishism and more attention to telling a story - the heavy stylisation is given over to the action (a function of the drama), not the fashion (a function of target-marketing).Once again the film centres on Kate Beckinsdale's teasingly latex-n-corset clad Selene and her burgeoning relationship with Michael, the hunky one with large black contact lenses. Derek Jacobi comes in to lend the gravitas that Bill Nighy struggled with last time around. Tony Curran is my favourite though, fulfilling the article, bearded baddie role vacated by Martin Sheen.Bears favourable comparison with the X-Men series; good work, Len Wiseman. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and vamp/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run, having just destroyed treacherous elder bloodsucker Viktor. Hot on their heels is recently awakened original vamp Marcus, who wishes to free his long imprisoned lycan brother William, but who must first extract vital information held in Selene's memory in order to do so.For Evolution, the sequel to his 2003 'vampire versus werewolf' hit Underworld, writer/director Len Wiseman once again plays by a set of very indistinct rules, thus allowing himself the flexibility necessary to make his rather flaky script work. By ignoring accepted vampiric and lycanthropic lore, Wiseman may risk upsetting many a die-hard monster fan, but?and this is a BIG 'but'?he manages to compensate for his contrived, confused, and convoluted script by making the film so damn slick and visually stunning that it's almost impossible not to have fun.An absolute feast for the eyes, Evolution is even better to look at than its predecessor, with mind-boggling special effects, more beautiful cinematography (although use of another colour other than blue would have been nice), and greater attention to detail. The sequel is also sexier than before (there's even a brief scene of rumpy pumpy with Kate and Scott), gorier than before (this time, blood is splashed all over the place), and packed with more outrageous fight action than before. Hell, even Kate Beckinsale's rubber-clad butt looks better than it did in the original Underworld!Evolution is spectacular, big-budget horror for the masses, and as such, it doesn't take too many risks (besides having an unfathomable plot, of course). But as far as mindless, gory, FX-laden popcorn flicks go, you could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An unknown chapter lies ahead..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that I noticed about Underworld Evolution was not how much it added to the story of the original film, but how strikingly similar it is. It's more like a continuation not of the story began in the original film, but a continuation of the film itself, like they had completed this whole movie back in 2003 but just cut the movie in half and gave us half of it then and the rest of it now. Not that that's a bad thing. Tarantino pulled that off with much success with the Kill Bill movies, but the problem is that many of the things that were disappointing about the original movie are also disappointing about this one. That being said, it's certainly true that fans of the first film will remain fans of the series after seeing the first sequel. Clearly their interests were at the forefront of screenwriter Danny McBride's (yeah, that one) mind when he wrote the script. But for all of the similar shallowness and ineffective action scenes, it's true that they have heard the cries of the public over some of the problems of the first film. There is in this movie, for example, the appearance of real light for the first time in the series, although it's interesting that they should fill it with a romance that is totally out of place and then some sex scenes that are, ah, not entirely unwelcome. Unfortunately, aesthetically pleasing or not, the sex is so out of place and an obvious pandering (to who, I'm not entirely sure) that it looks like it belongs in an entirely different movie. Personally, I felt a little awkward by knowing that Kate Beckinsale's husband, Les Wiseman, was behind the camera while she was on screen naked with Scott Speedman. I can never understand that.Kate Beckinsale is back as the death-dealer, Selene, and Scott Speedman is back as Michael, her half werewolf/half vampire lover, and this time they are on the run since Selene killed Viktor at the end of the original film and the hunt for his killer, she understands, is inevitable. Underworld Evolution teaches us more about the past of the three rulers and the origins of the great war between the vampires and the lycans. Markus is an older and more powerful vampire than Viktor, and he has a brother named William. And William is not only immortal but also the original vampire, and not only his brother but also his twin brother. And just when I'm thinking that their poor parents must be a little dismayed at the supernatural bickering that their kids have been doing for centuries, we meet their father, who is, shall we say, growing weary of the bickering.The special effects are impressive, much more than in the original film. I remember being struck by how dated they seemed in the first movie, and while the transformation effects in this movie are still totally unconvincing, they are certainly more detailed. The graphics have gotten much better, but I'm curious when and if CGI is ever going to be able to convince anyone that it's anything other than CGI. Others are highly impressive, however. There are the most realistic werewolves in this movie that I've ever seen, and the character of Markus is probably the movie's greatest achievement. There is a chase scene that calls to mind the chase scene at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and if the movie had more scenes like it it would have been much better.Unfortunately, among other things, the movie copied-and-pasted the snooze-inducing battle scenes from the original film. For two species of creatures that can be neither killed nor even harmed (for more than a few seconds) by knives or guns, I'm amazed at how many of them bring knives and guns to the battles. Maybe this is why they have managed to stay at war for nearly 1,000 years without either side killing the other off? At any rate, it is definitely the reason why the constant rattle of machine-gun fire does absolutely nothing to make the action in the movie at all interesting.The story, on the other hand, again tries to tell more than the material can sustain. It's wordy and dense, and again goes for that Old English formality from the original film that gives the vampires a feeling of authenticity but also conflicts with the fact that they have so much high technology. Thankfully, however, the movie is less of an assault on the ears, as director Les Wiseman has smartly veered away from the heavy metal route and instead relied on horror composer Marco Beltrani for the film's score. The result is a more traditional vampire feel in a film overflowing with special effects and pointless gunfights, although the combined effect is not entirely disappointing. The appearance of Alexander Corvinus (in a classy performance by Derek Jacobi), the father of Markus, Viktor, and William, lends respectability to the story, although they would have done well to give him more screen time. But he is a necessary element in this most modern version of the vampire/werewolf story, which otherwise might have suffered from having too many young beautiful people in it. I have to say that there are times that I lament the total passing of the time when vampire movies were classy endeavors of subdued horror, starring characters who suffered quietly even while radiating style and a strange sexuality, where the blood was representative and effective and not spraying all over the place. Underworld Evolution is so identical to the original film that it's worth saying that your opinion is almost surely dependent on how much you liked the original. Although there are more improvements than regressions?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worried about this movie for a while. After enjoying 'Underworld', I should have had high hopes, but as everyone knows sequels rarely excel or even equal their predecessor.However, it opens with an action scene. As a big fan of action, i was utterly fixated on the screen. Then follows another, albeit short, action scene. Shortly afterwards, another... In fact, its fair to say that the action is pretty much nonstop. Bonus.Once again, Kate Beckinsale pulls off a brilliant performance as a vampire. Yet somehow, Wiseman has managed to squeeze some chemistry between her and Scott Speedman. The supporting actors put in their share of great acting as well, and Tony Curran is a simply awesome big, bad neck-biter.It is by no means perfect, however. I was sad to see much of its predecessor's Gothic charm go. It would have been much better to see more of it set at the Vamp's mansion. I also feel that their are too many appearances and mentions of just normal people. The story is about immortals, not humans.However, I was engaged throughout. Len Wiseman has once again delivered a well thought out plot coupled with stunning and imaginative action sequences played by brilliant actors. It doesn't beat the first, but certainly equals it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic direction with regards to the camera. As reminiscent of any vampire flick I've seen with reference to the original. But as is common in this genre, bloody awful casting and shocking schoolboy script. Stage actors are good for a reason, big booming voices. Whereas this film had, except for the main roles, whiney soap actor voices trying to perform strong dominant/military acting... absolutely destroyed many scenes. Even the female lead has a stronger vocal capacity than most of the males in this movie. I really can't decide whether the scoolboyish story-line/scripting is worse than the basic casting failures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part two luckily picks in were the first entry stopped. Well, you have to wait just after the opening credits before that happens. Before ethe opening credits you will get to know what happened to the twins from Corvinus (Derek Jacobi), one is a vampire (Marcus (Tony Curran)), the other a lycan (William (Brian Steele)). First I asked myself why they are showing that part because we already knew that stuff but there's more going on, it's all about the pendants.This entry moves a bit away from vampires living among humans, we do get to know why Selena (Kate Beckinsale) her parents were killed. But there's more going on, slowly she falls in love with Michael (Scott Speedman). We do have one love scene involving nudity from Kate and Scott but it is filmed in a way that they don't show anything. A bit further in the movie we do have bare-breasted women. I had a bit of mixed feelings about Evolution because here soldiers are involved and there's a lot of shooting going on. Still, it never leaves what is told in th eoriginal flick. Also, the wire-effects used in Underworls are a bit left out of Evolution and that was a particular thing in Underworld. But we had to sit through the whole story because we had to know what is going on between the twins and Selene.Effects used were sublime especially in the way Marcus was flying around. A good flick but a bit more talking then it's predecessor.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These two live their lives together in the caves of Europe and Selene has a daughter Lorren. All I could think about was another one to continue this rare love that was built on insane circumstances and how these two overcame obstacles. Their characters should run into Marcus resurrected from the cold waters Selene cut him up into. Marcus being the oldest immortal enables him to rise using his last blood strands preserved in the icy waters to do so. Water is a preserver for vampires. He seeks out Michael and Selene and when he arrives in Scotland discovers Lorren and covets her blood being hybrid blood and to hurt Selene and Michael he steals Lorren and takes her to Hungary where she is kept in a deserted castle dungeon under 3 feet of concrete. Michael and Selene go to save her and destroy Marcus once and for all with incineration. They venture to the mountains of Hungary and meet humans that have no idea they are hybrids. Since they can walk by day, no one knows anything and they live among people. The final days of Marcus arrive when Selene finds him. I won't say anymore other than Marcus intends to brainwash Lorren to think she is his daughter and wants to use her blood to create a new coven. Great movie! I loved it better than the first one and was on the edge of my seat. It gave me a lot of ideas for the next one but I'm not a film writer just a watcher who appreciates a good thriller every now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sequel, not as much teeth as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be less enjoyable than its predecessor because it was less of an action movie than the first. There is still plenty of action, and the plot is still pretty good, but it isn't as engaging as the first. Perhaps because there are more characters, and the plot is more complicated. Still it was overall satisfying to see what happens next.I was put off by the over the top amount of blood featured in this movie. The first movie was very tasteful in this regard, hardly any gore, and few bloody messes. This film is quite the opposite. What were the producers thinking..."If there is a way to get more blood dripping, flying, spraying everywhere; oh and more brain matter and other body parts, and hey even some vomit, lets get it in there..." Too much pointless gore, even for a vampire and werewolf movie.Outside of the unnecessary carnage featured in this movie, it had a good plot which moved well. Again, excellent character development which engages the audience, at least until we feel icky from being sprayed with blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really remember the plot too well, but I do remember an opening with werewolves and vampires with swords and armor fighting it out, and I did like that bit. The rest is familiar good guy vs. bad guy, no one to trust, back against the wall action, with a few flashbacks here and there for cohesiveness. The film quality and cinematography was excellent, and the action sequences fluid and not choppy as say Transformers. I watched this on TV, and it killed some time. The Underworld franchise could be interesting if it just wasn't so damn cliché with it's forbidden love story angle, and cleaned up a few other clichés as well. Still it was better and a wee bit more imaginative than a lot of what passes for action films these days. For what it's worth I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again the eternal fight between vampires and werewolves in this second entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original and gore-soaked vampires film begins in 1202 a.d., eight centuries ago. Unknown to humanity, a blood feud raged between a ruling class of vampires and rebellious legion of werewolves known as Lycans. Legend tells that the war began with two brothers, the immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus(Tony Curran) bitten by bat became the blood leader of the vampires. William(Brian Steele) , bitten by wolf became the first and most powerful Lycan. For six centuries Selene(Kate Beckinsale) was a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she was betrayed. The war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Kraven, the second-in-command had formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor(Bill Nighy), vampires leader . But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. But Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe. He has betrayed them all. Soon the hunt would be on for his killer. Selene has but one ally left : Michael(Scott Speedman), the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither vampire nor Lycan, but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before they're found. Their only hope now is to awaken to Markus , the last remaining Elder and expose the truth, before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's match for him awake. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael are going to Tanis's(Steven Mackintosh) fortress for getting information. As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty entertaining. Packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with bullets. Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful and dark cinematography by Simon Duggan . Spectacular production design by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of known blockbusters, such as 10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black among them. The motion picture is well directed by Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale's husband . He's also the screenwriter along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. All participate in the following, a prequel in pre-production, titled 'Rise of the Lycans' directed by Patrick Tatopoulos and with similar actors. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie when it first came out, but now, two years later, I watch it again and wonder why I liked it so much. It seemed to me that they dragged what could have been a half-hour flick into two hours with about eighteen twenty-minute fight scenes, and it seems to me that the directors were more preoccupied with making Kate look sexy in a sassy, up-yours kind of way. Characterization is weak, and compared to the first movie, the setting and storyboard is flat. Don't get me wrong, this movie has many redeeming graces, but overall it pales in comparison to the first. A lot of the characters that made the first so great are gone, and the fact that only Michael and Selene survive makes the whole movie a bit unbelievable. One more thing--Michael's "death" was strange and, as far as I can see, unnecessary, except that it evokes more humanitarian emotions from Selene than are seen from the rest of the movie--reminding us she's actually a person and not a robotic fighting machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>underworld: evolution is clearly made for those who liked the first underworld film, and it cant stand for itself. but as a sequel it does many things right by keeping most successful elements of the first movie and improving on the flaws. so, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman are still great as the leading sweethearts while Shane Brolly (as Kraven) is killed off early. the production design is still awesome while the action scenes and special effects have improved drastically.however, the most surprising good thing about the original underworld was its story, which is also this sequels greatest letdown. not much happens throughout the movie, its basically just one action scene after another. and yet i found what little story there is kinda hard to follow. who wants what exactly for what reason? why is everybody always fighting everybody? is Michael the first and only hybrid, or is Marcus a hybrid as well? Alexander Corvinus doesn't have the heart to kill his son but helps Selene do it? its really a pity the weak and confusing story weights down all thats good about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally forgettable, certainly compared to the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION when I saw at the movies. I enjoyed the first film so much (I gave it 10 stars) but alas this one doesn't even come close to capturing the sleek minimalist approach to goth sensibilities as the first film, which I thought was pitch perfect. Sequels rarely live up to the glory of a successful first film but this one feels and looks like a completely different film. The fatalistic battle between the vampires and werewolves, so careful executed in UNDERWORLD, is lost here as the film mainly focuses on Selene and Michael. Any new characters introduced in the sequel are boring, ill-conceived and they don't register at all, certainly that old man who resides on the ship (which is a bad element! It just doesn't fit the Underworld universe).Even though I remember many scenes from UNDERWORLD, I barely remember anything from the sequel except for that scene with the helicopter. I remember so little of it that I can't even write a longer review than this. The producers should have worked harder on creating a compelling continuation to the first film. It's almost as if they started shooting UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION without a finished script. The end result is a half-baked thing. A total letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vampire movie always needs a complicated story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A vampire movie always needs a complicated story to make it interesting. This is why Angel, and after that Spike, in Buffy The Vampire Slayer were good characters because they made a very complicated story with good backgrounds. But the comparison between Buffy and Underworld ends here, the two are very different. This movie is much more brutal. I am not someone who likes horror movies, but this one is not about horror but very much a fantasy, a world apart.I won't tell the story, but it takes place just after the first movie. If you have never seen the first movie or if you have a long time ago, this sequel gives you a bit of information from the first movie. Actually, this part is very confusing and they should have just asked the viewer to rent the first one! The lead actress, Kate Beckinsale, is good into her role, but not perfect. I liked her through the movie, but something is missing. From my point of view, the most important thing that they did with this character was to give her a bit of humanity around her romance with Scott Speedman's character.They hired some British actors to do vampires. In the "featurettes" of the DVD you can see how they explain why they hired Derek Jacobi as "The First" vampire. For me, he wasn't very convincing. If you rent or buy the DVD, please take a look at the special features where you can see how they made the movie and it is very fascinating.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a cross between Sarah Connors (Terminator) and Lara Croft turned into a vampire! She is a real hero, but I didn't really feel that she was stronger than the other characters. In the end, I like this movie. The characters could have been played a bit more. Also, I felt confused for a lot of details in the story. But, they gave enough information to open the door to a franchise. A good action package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine told me that I had to see Underworld:Evolution in order to understand Underworld1. He was correct. UW:E is a great film. Selene, the Deathdealer, Michael, the hybrid, Marcus, the would be king, and Alexander Covinus, every bodies father. Marcus is the character that makes this film. His undying love for his twin brother, William, drives him to his death. He will do anything to find his brother's prison and release him, even kill his father. If there is such a thing as a touching scene in the Underworld movies, it is the one where Marcus hears his brother, as they are attacking him in the castle and he yells out his name. If that's not brotherly love, I do not know what is. The strength of Marcus is exhibited when he pulls the helicopter down. I am telling you, he makes this film. There are others who believe the Blade Trinity are better films. Not even close. Remember Blade does not have to deal with lycans and hybrids. Selene is the ultimate Deathdealer. 500 years of killing lycans. Also, UW:E has an interesting twist. Marcus and William are forefathers of Michael, but yet Micheal nor Marcus ever acknowledge that. You would think that Michael would tell Selene, whoa up, Marcus is my forefather and he's only looking for his brother, another forefather of mine and I will have nothing to do with you destroying them. As a matter of fact Selene, you have been going around for some 500 years killing my kind. A great film. Good action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Better than the First...If That Means Anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution continues the uninteresting saga of war between the vampires and the Lycans. The film goes back to the beginnings of the ancient feud between the two tribes as Selene, the beautiful vampire heroine, and Michael, the lycan hybrid, try to unlock the secrets of their bloodlines. This will be a modern tale of action, intrigue and forbidden love, which takes them into the battle to end all wars as the immortals must finally face their retribution.The first film was dull, uninteresting, and boring. I had myself dreading to see this sequel. So why did I see it? I thought there would actually be something good in here and I was right, in a bad way. What I didn't like about the first film was that the whole war thing was boring.This movie actually continues with this story but has tons more action, violence, sexuality, and gore, for the most part. For those reasons, I would say, are why I actually like this movie a bit better (not a whole lot) than the first film, which keeps talking on and on about the raging war.The trailer for the film looks promising to be a good ol' popcorn movie, still, having to deal with the plot. What these movies try to be was not to have a monster movie without a plot. Instead, it tries to have a storyline with all these action scenes. What is so bad about that is, as I said several times, it is boring.Honestly, I would've like to see an all out popcorn movie with a dull plot and nothing but action and violence which this sequel did but it still carried the plot. I also got a little affection for the raging war in this movie. I don't know why. It just got to me, but for the most part, it was still uninteresting.Like the first film, the production design in here is great, as well as the whole look of the film. The CGI and make-up designs in this film is also better from the first. And for the action sequences, they are tons better. Kate Beckinsale is sexy in her usual roll, with Scott Speedman right by her side.This film is less dull, has a better character development, and has more action than the first movie. Is that a good thing? For me, it is because it catches my attention in the most part of the film, although still being bored with the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Len Wiseman's journey into his vampire-werewolf war seems to have hit a snag. In what's basically a cliff-notes version of the original, much of the slick comic book feel has been toned down in favor of more generic action/horror scenes, and the plot is a simpler fill-in-the-blank format rather than the Shakesperean drama of Underworld. The characters are still underdeveloped, and some the action scenes gave me a headache (the chase involving Marcus in particular), but the final showdown, in which Selene welcomely shifts back into Deathdealer mode, was a return to form that this drastically needed by that point. Overall, much less of a good movie than the first one, but it has it's moments.</fullReview>

Apparently, the mansion at the end of the previous movie was in Russia the entire time, even though the one guy who was in America walked to the front gate. Aside from this minor oops, we have a pretty good, but not quite as good as the original. The action is good, and the gore is bloody, the problem a lot of shots where they just keep building up tension for the fight. They slowly ease up on the situation, before finally there is some action. The story is not quite up to par either as the lycans or werewolves are virtually absent through much of the film and not really a factor in the plot much at all. Still there are a couple of rather revelations here and there that we learn and things from the previous movie explained. We also get nudity in this one, however, I found this a bit unnecessary. Still though you get some head rippings, some good gore, and a couple of really cool fights. All good, just not up to the first movie.</fullReview>

In addition, darkness and night dominate these scenes. When it is compared to the first film the wolf men are designed more realistic. One negative point I must mention is the lack of the music.

		<fullReview>After Blade, slick vampire action movies became fashionable and Underworld on the face of it had all the necessary ingredients, slick action, leather costumes, underground conspiracies and vampires actually doing battle with werewolves! However, no matter how hard I tried to enjoy the film I could not help but feel that something was missing and relegated the movie to just another action flick that made no real impression or lasting memory. Underworld Evolution increases the degree of bloodshed, quality of special effects and introduces new more lethal characters. It introduces the first vampire who is therefore the most powerful vampire but who we are told is a hybrid (although we are also told that the genetically created hybrid from the first movie was the first hybrid - contradiction?) His brother is the first werewolf and therefore the most powerful but they have a father who is actually more powerful ( I thought they were first of their kind and the most powerful - contradiction?). Anyway, the werewolf has been sealed away because he was too destructive but his brother now wants to release him (yeah that makes sense). Meanwhile Celine and the first (or second hybrid?) attempt to stop this supposed apocalyptic scenario. Lots of explosions and zero character development later they all do battle with Celine made even stronger by drinking the first vampires blood (I think he was the first?). She is so strong she can lift a man upside down! (Arnie can do that and he's not even a vampire, although some would say he has sucked the blood out of California's expectations). Various unconvincing fights and helicopter explosions ensue. Underworld is probably an improvement on the first movie given the scale, relentless action and more worthy villains but once again some ingredient appears to be missing and it probably boils down to the fact that we aren't really made to care about any of the characters or outcome of the movie and there appear to be a number of flaws in the plot. Ultimately this leads to the film being very average which is a shame given the level of effort that has been thrown into the special effects and scale of the movie. Alas, special effects do not maketh a film. Wasted opportunity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, very good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film garnered few positive reviews, the overall community yielded no buzz, and the January release date was less than attractive.Then the unthinkable happened...the movie turned out to be pretty good.It really comes down to Kate Beckingsale's character who channels the torn warrior well. Unlike the first entry, the script actually simplified its structure and brought more push to the project. The monsters are just menacing enough to hold your attention while Beckingsale holds it sternly.So far the main criticism is the "overwriting," the incorporation of the film's vast mythology into the present structure. I find that's what made the films unique. There's a lot of information here and it takes a little time after you've seen it for all of it to settle in. But when it does, the film sits well with you.Overall much better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better then the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Underworld, and I think that wasn't a good movie. A little bit boring and slow.But Underworld: Evolution is much better. More exciting, more interesting.But I don't want to talk about the quality of the movie. I'm Hungarian. :) The first interesting thing was a "Vigyázz!" sign on an electricity box. I was surprised and I couldn't believe my eyes. So I thought it was just my mistake.After a few minutes I heard something strange. I thought that was a radio from a taxi or sthg like that, and all in Hungarian. I was wrong. That was the background noise. And finally the people in the bar started to speak in Hungarian, the TV spoke in Hungarian, the police car had a "Rend&amp;#337;rség" sign on the side, which is "police" in Hungarian. I was very surprised.And finally there are no such huge forests and mines, no such styled villages in Hungary. :) It was a great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie, because (1) I love Kate (oy in that leather outfit...sigh) and (2) I wanted to see how the story progressed from the first film (assuming this was a "where we left off" type sequel, which it sort of was.I think this movie was actually better than the first, maybe because it had more action, maybe because they took a little more time putting in details of the war between the vampires and lycans. However a few things still seemed silly.(1) The whole business of western legends' two premier monsters fighting each other with modern firearms sort of silly. Hand to hand, blades, sure, but machine guns? And, come to think of that here's a tip for Kate: if you're fighting the primeval vampire, and you have a combat shotgun, don't keep shooting him in the chest, destroy his head!!!!!!!!!! (oy).As several others have said, if you didn't see the first film, this one won't make much sense. If you have about 4 hours to kill, I would recommend getting both of them, just don't expect masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel or simply an Extension of the first movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no break between these two movies. So I might be glad that it wasn't actually called Underworld 2. It's been quite awhile since I've seen a movie without some sort of break between the movies. Blade certainly didn't do it when it led to Blade II. There was a an obvious gap. And it lost me along the way. Underworld Evolution took me awhile to watch. I loved the first movie so much I was afraid the sequel might ruin it. So up until today I hadn't watched it. I can now honestly say I regret doing that. This new movie basically extends the first movie and makes both parts better in the end. It's been awhile since I've written a review. Mostly because LOTR has distracted me. And because I've had some major studying to do. So I guess it's fitting I return to something in my forte.And certainly Scott Speedman had to be on his best behavior around the directors wife during that film melting scene. I took at least 3 looks at it and I don't even think Kate showed one breast. But the way it was done was outstanding. I just wish Kate wouldn't smoke in real life. And she's notorious for it. The British element is in full force in this movie. Which I hope continue's in whatever sequel's or prequels come out on this series. And they are using more iris color transition than in the first movie. The indication of emotion is shown thru this. I like that.I think the William character was poorly portrayed in the movie. He has very little to do and is killed quite quickly towards the end. But it should be interesting to see if there ever will be a sequel to this movie so we can see how Kate's character adapts to sunlight. Perhaps it'll be explained as to why Alexander Corvinus inherited this.But this movie reinvigorated my interest in anything Underworld. So I'm bound to buy the books, and I've got the score. Is there a game yet?? :)7/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone remembers the hype around the first movie, they'd recall that almost every site that reviewed the film asked for three things: More body contact fighting (too many gunfights), more blood, and more romance. Many also complained about the skewing of vampire and werewolf lore, as well as the absence of the usual supernatural elements surrounding the two.Well, the sequel gives us exactly that, in excess. Unfortunately, like when Coca Cola added more sugar to their product and ended up losing much of their original fan base, this took away from the heart the original had.I personally enjoyed the first movie a lot: the many gunfights were completely justified - in a future where such technology was available, why would the vampires want to dirty their hands more than they had to? The blood wasn't spraying everywhere 'cause it didn't need to, and the romance was exactly what should have happened over the span of like three days. It would have been horribly unrealistic if Selene was all over Michael from the first day they met, instead, he subtly influenced her to question the beliefs she'd spent most of her immortal life abiding by.I thought the first movie was a well-made, nicely thought-out break from the typical gore fest vampire flick (I wouldn't even put Underworld in the horror category).The sequel, however, shows that the director listening to critics too much can completely ruin a good idea. The heart of the first film was barely preserved, and although I enjoyed watching it, Underworld Evolution was pure entertainment, mostly fanservice.I didn't mind it - I enjoyed it when I watched it, but any expectations I had were unfulfilled. I'm not a horror fan in general, nor am I a gore-hound or a vampire flick person, I just liked the storyline and characters for what they were. It's unfortunate that many people who would have liked it didn't see it, probably because it was marketed as a vampire vs. werewolf horror flick, and not as anything with any measure of substance. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution (2006) was an entertaining movie, i enjoyed it, never got bored and being a fan of old school horror with proper special effects, i was curious about how the CGI and special effects would look, even though i'm not a CGI fan i was pleasantly surprised, i have seen so much awful CGI in modern horror and action films lately, but this film looked good and it was a fast paced movie, with lots of blood and gore and plenty of action too.Of course the big attraction of this movie is the lovely Kate Beckinsdale as "Selene" the sexy vampire. She sure looks good in that tight PVC doesn't she and she kicks butt too, shes got great moves!!!!! I'm a massive fan of horrors and action films, but i love the 80's style and don't really dig all this modern horror, most of it is sub-standard remakes of old classics or teen slashers! But like i say, i enjoyed this and i expect i'll watch it again in the near future so therefore i will give this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adds so much to the first and all in all, a better film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the first Underworld being a mix of Godfather in the world of the undead and Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves(as it was originally pitched), it was interesting to see how its sequel would play out. Throughout the first film, we are told how powerful the elders are... and we do get to see some of their strength. At the very end, there is a hint at *the* elder, the strongest... and rest assured, you are treated to about an entire film of said elder. Bigger may not always be better, but here, it very much is. The characters get more background, more development. During the first, I felt somewhat bored at times, but with this, I was intrigued throughout, and following the story closely. The plot adds to the first, picking up basically exactly where it left off and adding background information. It develops nicely throughout, and there are quite a few(but not too many) tiny effective twists, and I don't think I saw any of them coming. The pace is intense, but not overwhelmingly so. The action, in almost every case, is awesome. During several of the biggest scenes, I was on the edge of my seat. Wiseman has a knack for action. Heck, the trailer of either film'll tell you that. The film builds up to an astounding showdown, final battle, and it's one of the best fights I've seen for a while. The effects are amazing. The scope of the whole film is several times bigger than the first. As another reviewer points out, it's kind of like the case with X-Men and X2... the first laid the groundwork, established characters and the "world", and the second just utilized that perfectly. The acting is excellent, pretty much all-round. Impressed with how Bill Nighy did in the first, the crew opted for more British actors in this, and their talent pays off, big time. Now, with all that positive said, I'm afraid the negatives must be said, as well... the cinematography, while at times quite good, leaves a bit to be desired, often during the action sequences. You could almost always make out what was going on, but there were several shots that had potential to look much cooler. Also, the back-story... it's a good thing that it's there, but you kind of wish they had a more interesting way of telling you than by the near-constant flashbacks. In this film, Len uses them as the crutch that Kubrick often used narration... only thing is that Stanley implemented his supporting tool much more smoothly. Also, with this sequel, the similarities between this series and The Matrix Trilogy become even more apparent. I'm sure anyone who's seen the trilogy as well as these two films can see what I mean. And the problem that was seen in the X-Men films(as a result of too many powerful characters) is evident... there are times when dubious explanations are employed to keep characters isolated from each other. There is only one in this film, but it's somewhat drawn out and moderately weaker than in those films. Then there are scenes that you wonder if they couldn't have done without... told it in a better way. The exploration of Michael's blood-lust early on in the film is a good idea, but the execution could have been better(first thing to cut: the very unnecessary reaction to the food). And was the sex scene really pivotal? One must wonder if that wasn't terribly awkward to shoot, with Beckinsale being married to Wiseman. All in all, a better film than the first, and much easier and more worthwhile to watch. Good Gothic violent action, with a good story, making for 90 entertaining minutes. I recommend this to any fan of Gothic style, horror and action. Very much an improvement. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evolution fell short for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved the original movie and was so psyched for the sequel but unfortunately it fell short for me.I thought the beginning sequence was wonderful as far as filling in the missing pieces of back story. Those 10 minutes did more to develop the Viktor, Marcus and William characters than the rest of the film. A great disappointment was the lack of development and explanation of the Corvinus character that started it all. I did like how it seamlessly picks up just hours after the first film.The action was good but not great and the plot moved very slowly after a certain point. What was a plus of the first movie was accomplished in the sequel in that you find yourself loathing yet also feeling very sad for the villains of the movie. This was much like Lucian from the first movie. These characters just wanted to live and love like everyone else.Like many others I disapprove of Bill Nighy as the choice of Viktor. His voice sucks and is hard to understand. I thought perhaps it was just his inflection in trying a "Vampire" voice until I saw Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and realized his voice is just wimpy.In whole this movie wasn't a flop to me but it could've used some better scripting and dedication to telling it's story. I really wanted a concrete answer as to just "what" Selene became by drinking Corvinus' blood...maybe a third movie beckons?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not a big sequel fan. Disney spoiled it for me early on with the 2nd lion king - thanks by the way - and later on by blade II and some others.So with a sceptic look I still had to watch this movie. I was so positively surprised by the first film that much that I simply had to give it another go.And as the title of this article predicts, this is not a bad sequel at all. It has all the standards; same style, same actors and actresses, a story that starts right where the first left of, with a small history lesson to recall the first film.And though it still isn't a brilliant movie, it really is a good equal to his predecessor. Enjoyable to watch with somewhat convincing acting as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I took the time and watched both movies in quick succession. And the thing that struck me was how smooth the movies were. In the first movie the universe of the movie were quickly established with a steady hand. And from then of, the movies were true to the premises of the universe. Even in "Evolution" they didn't go far over board,like it usually is in "monster" sequels. Okay, Marcus was pretty extreme, but somehow he fit in. And despite being really powerful, I didn't get that Invincible vibe from him. You know, the one that kills all suspense.Anyway, instead of going full out with the special effects, gore and whatever, like in the second Blade movie, Underworld and it's sequel were more about telling a story. All the time i got the feeling the director really wanted to tell a story, instead of just loading up on big fancy fight scenes. Even with all the special effects, the blood an gore there was in these movies, they still managed to seem almost downplayed. Oh yes, there was tempo, and loads of action. It just didn't feel rushed. everything happened in its own time.To sum it up: Good acting, steady yet creative camera, a good thought through script, the details of the "universe" was wonderfully put together, top notch special effects that weren't over exaggerated, and excellent costumes and sets.The reason I still don't give these movies more than a six, is a certain emotional coldness throughout both movies. The main characters' emotional reactions seemed muted, and caused the watcher to be less taken by the movie. Underworld and it's sequel lacked that little bit that makes you really concentrate on the movie. Selene seemed oddly apathetic on several occasions. We never got to see real emotional responses from her. even her anger seemed cold and controlled. Do not misunderstand me. I do not think Kate is to blame for this. She did the absolute most out of what she had to work with. No, this emotional absence was something that could be found in almost all the characters to some degree. the exceptions were that black vampire security chief or what he was, and Cornelius and his men. They seemed to be slightly more emotional. And Kraven was kind of amusing with his petulant child routine.Still I failed to be really captivated by Underwold. If they make a third, which i hope they do, i wish they will give a bit more character depth to the main characters.That's all for now Palmar Olav L?klingholm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing though decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely a disappointment in comparison to the first. What I loved about the original was the mythology of the story - the ongoing feud between the two species. While this one delved into the history of the mythology a lot, it forgot to incorporate it into the plot. There's absolutely nothing on the war that was the centrepoint of the first one - it's simply focused on the two leads and the villain. Not to mention that it moves far too quickly from one action scene to the next, without stopping to take a breath and let the characters interact in a way not using guns or blood. While that may make for an entertaining ride, it definitely doesn't have the great story that the first one had, nor the style, for that matter. A decent action flick, but that's it.The action in this film is quite impressive, but it's not as stylish as in the first one. It's far too generic, although there are some cool sequences (the truck scene comes to mind, if only because Marcus flying alongside the truck looks really cool). The special effects I thought were actually a step down from the first one - the werewolves looked much more fake, and they seemed to go from human state to goblin (?) state before becoming full-blown wolves. It was kinda weird. Oh, and the gore. I usually don't have a problem with it, but it was way over-the-top in this film. It was like every death had to be as bloody as possible. It didn't bother me, I just found it unnecessary. And that sex scene - WTF was up with that? I won't even get started on that.The story was kinda intriguing, with the twin brothers who started the war, but it didn't carry through into the present of the film - just remained in the past. I'm not sure why Marcus wanted to release his brother from the prison, if they were on opposite sides of the war. Nor why Selene's human father was commissioned to build the prison - just seemed like a cheap way to tie her character into the story more. There were many problems I had with the plot, and it just felt like lazy writing this time around. And I guess that ending means no more sequels? Can't say I'm disappointed, though a prequel exploring the history more could be cool - that Amelia chick needs to have more screen time. Overall, a decent action thriller but a disappointing sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much of an Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution is a definite disposable film: it is mildly diverting while watching it, but has no lasting impact. A sequel to 2004's Underworld, it is a action film involving Werewolves and Vampires that looks slick, has some decent action sequences and features an attractive lead, but doesn't posses much other than that.The film opens mere hours after the conclusion of the original, with Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman), star-crossed lovers (she's a vampire assassin, he's a unique vampire/werewolf hybrid) on the run from the vampire elite, led by Kraven (Shane Brolly). Kraven has decided to kill the remaining vampire elder, Marcus (Tony Curran), but he has other plans, taking control of the situation and chasing after Selene and Michael, in search of an amulet that Michael possesses.It turns out that Marcus is the original vampire, and his brother, William, was the original werewolf, and Marcus is interested in planning a family reunion. Selene and Michael must attempt to unravel the situation, with the assistance of an enigmatic stranger (Derek Jacobi), and stop Marcus from unleashing the vicious William on the world.The biggest problem with Underworld: Evolution is the same one that was hobbled the original, the lack of any character depth to the leads. Selene and Michael are about as underdeveloped and uninteresting as you can get. They are supposed to be in love, and the film even features a graphic sex scene, but there is no heat or emotion between either of them. Both characters are flat, and it is near impossible to work up much concern as to their well-being when scenes of jeopardy are imminent. Yes, Beckinsale is especially easy on the eyes with her curvaceous body poured into skin-tight leather, but good looks can only carry a film so far before you find yourself wanting a little more substance to accompany the pretty pictures.Underworld: Evolution wins the prize for popcorn film with the most convoluted, back story heavy plot in some time. So much of the film is predicated on having seen, and remembering a great deal of, the original Underworld, and for anyone who has not burned the details of that film into their subconscious, they may have a difficult time deciphering much of what is happening in Underworld: Evolution for a great deal of it's running time. Even with the assistance of several flashbacks at different times in the story, it's difficult to follow until fairly late in the film, and even then certain developments may prove to be head-scratchers.Visually, the film has the same cold, heavily monotone color scheme as the first, which looks neat at first, but you quickly realize that not only did The Matrix do something similar (except with the color green), but it proves to eventually be a monotonous style. The film's visual effects are often impressive, especially many scenes involving Marcus in his vampire guise and many of the werewolf effects are impressive, also factoring in the fact that this is a film that didn't have the most lavish of budgets (also more than the original).In the action sequence department, Underworld: Evolution is a little more elaborate than the first, especially of the late film action sequences, and moments throughout are certainly engaging, to be certain. The film was competently made, and not exactly dull, but even so, there is still something lacking in Underworld: Evolution that keeps it from really grabbing hold of you. It is a very middle of the road movie: it's diverting enough to fill two hours, but has no long lasting effects. It is neither bad nor good, it's just there, and that is simply not enough to make for a satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the war between vampires and lycans rages on, vampire-assassin Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and lycan-hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) team up to work together in uncovering the secrets behind their ancient bloodlines. In other words, Underworld: Evolution picks up literally right where Underworld left off - and it does so with fierce action until the end, providing overkill gore stimuli for the viewer in every fight scene.This is not my type of film; the premise alone is laughable - but I was certainly amused and pleasantly surprised by Len Wiseman's Underworld (2003). I thought it brought a fresh mixture of old-school vampires flicks and new Matrix stylized effects (although science fiction films are now overdosing on the latter). This film is exactly the same as the first one, so the novelty of this mixture has worn off and you feel that something is missing. This void is instead filled by huge doses of generic but over-the-top action - and nothing else.The depressing blue-grey tone of the film has also gotten old - ancient, almost. Beckinsale is a truly atrocious actress in the Underworld series and I have counted her smiles throughout both films: a total of 1?. This just contributes to the depressing, perpetually gloomy tone of Evolution, and it is much too serious for this type of films. It's about VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES FIGHTING for god's sake, so just have fun with it.5/10</fullReview>

The werewolves evolve the ability to return to human form. The werewolves become the vampire's servants. The vampires keep them as their guardians. A vampiress falls in love with a werewolf. They have a bit of fun. The vampiress gets knocked up by the werewolf. The vampiress is murdered. The werewolves form and underground movement. The "impregnator" becomes their leader. The vampiress's murder is covered up.MAN, vampires can be busy. Apparently those immortals have short memories. And, in fact, Victor had only been a vampire for about 20 years before Selena.OH WAIT, this all makes no fricking sense!Welcome to underworld evolution. A world much like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. By which I mean no one bothered to study the time line and see that it was messed up.The movie is entertaining enough. Explosions, fighting, car chases, gratuitous sex scenes, shooting people, werewolves, vampires, hybrids, blah blah, whatever. The thing is, the most entertaining things about the first movie are the location, the idea of a secret war, the interaction between humans, werewolves, and vampires. The complex social structure, and fight scenes in subways.This movie abandons all that for some non-existent Podunk backwater state in Europe, complete with oceans and mountains and abandoned warehouses. There are no pure werewolves except for a couple of mindless guard dogs who apparently have no SOULS, and there is no complex social structure. There is only a non-sensible "story" and a whole lot of hybridization, which, apparently, is easier then EVERYONE thought.Whatever. Watch it late at night. Don't expect much, and you will get what you expect. Things explode, so I suppose you can enjoy that at least.</fullReview>

Directed by Len WisemanAfter "Under World" set the scene for high paced vampire and werewolf movies I can't help but feel almost sick to my stomach. I hated the first "Under World" it was nothing more than cool effects and the same goes for this one too but does surpass it's original. Thanks to some creativity by continuous screen writer Danny McBride who worked with Wiseman on the first one. The movie is creative, the effects are wild but the movie just can't hold up. I see the story I see the whole plot but it just can't be supported by sexy vamp Beckinsale all alone. Who returns to see the betrayal and cause of the Blood war between Death Dealers and Lycans. Things just don't seem right, and maybe a total of 25 percent of this movie is actually real everything else is CGI, and I'm getting sick of that. The effects are cool but doesn't help the movie by too much with out a well written story with some decent dialogue. Lugosi and Chaney must be spinning in their graves right now to see their genre turned to this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there can be no doubt, Underworld: Evolutions, like its predecessor, Underworld, is a beautiful looking movie, it suffers from the same illness that hobbled the original: a confusing, underwritten back story. It is Gothic film-making in every sense, but the story is muddled and, ultimately, a victim of the movie's emphasis of form over content, style over substance. The script, as far as there is one, is inane, the dialogue wooden and the acting overwrought. Yes, the special effects are, indeed, special, and Ms. Beckinsale looks stunning in her leather body suit, but it ends up being much ado about absolutely nothing. And for those who are considering it for a Saturday night rental without having seen the original, prepare to be utterly lost with regard to the storyline of the war between the vampire and the "lycans", or werewolves. Even having seen the original, it was, alas, a distant memory, and, as such, I couldn't recall who was who, and what it was they were fighting about.If all you are looking for is a violent, garish, blue-tinted, overblown music video of a film, then you might not be too disappointed. If, however, you are looking for a compelling, intriguing vampire movie, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>story lost on spread of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of my most looked forward to movies of the year. I wanted to see more of the back story and more of the moody film style that had set the first film apart. Instead we get an increase in the levels of violence, an increase in the sex element and a decrease in any sense of story. It was still exciting, still good to look at but sadly disappointing.if there is a third film the makers could do worse than to look at the Russian film the night watch. Similar in ambition night-watch delivers a great back story matched by its visuals and leaves us wanting to know more. The more you know the more you want to know.The next underworld film will need to work hard at matching both style and substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution A Good Sequel With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution is a good sequel with some flaws from director Len Wiseman who returns to give audiences for the most part action wise what fans come to expect from these type of movies. Kate Beckinsale reprises her role as Selene whose now on the run with her love Michael after killing Viktor trying to uncover the mystery behind the ancient feud between her race and werewolves known as Lycans. Beckinsale is still convincing as Selene especially in the action/fight sequences plus she still looks great in leather. Scott Speedman also returns as Michael the vampire/werewolf hybrid who fortunately gets more to do in this one than he did in the original. Speedman like Beckinsale continue to be effective as their characters in the movie. Tony Curran joins the cast as the new deadlier villain named Marcus the first true vampire. Curran makes for an imposing villain but his showdown near the end with Beckinsale felt rushed and was a bit of a letdown. Curran still makes the best of his villain role in the movie. One thing they improved on was that this sequel has two main villains Marcus and his werewolf brother William who can't change back to his human form compared to many of them in the original. Brian Steele the actor who plays William unfortunately though is easily defeated at the end and doesn't get nearly enough screen time. Most of the focus is on Beckinsale, Speedman, and Curran. Steele shows up in the beginning as William and then doesn't show up again until near the finale. Steele and Curran however are still solid as the villains. The rest of the cast including Derek Jakobi, Steven Makinstosh, and Bill Nighy are okay in their brief extended appearances. Shane Brolly also returns from the first one as Kraven but his role is cut rather short early on in the movie. The action/fight sequences are impressive but after a while they sort of become a bit repetitive and the finale was a letdown. They still worked though none the less. There were a few surprises and some questions are answered. The film had a faster pace mainly because of the action was pretty much non-stop and the special effects were cool. The werewolves, vampires, and their transformers are equally impressive even if you can tell its obviously CG but there's no other way they could do that so it works for the movie. There's also a steamy sex scene featuring Beckinsale which sort of felt unnecessary but hey I'm not complaining. Underworld Evolution isn't that bad of a film it just could have been a little better. It has enough action, some suspense, menacing villains, cool, great special effects, and good performances by the cast who make this sequel worth watching at least once despite it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what your thinking, another stupid horror film. Well your wrong Underworld evolution is anything but stupid it's a hugely entertaining action-horror film that right up there with some of the best sequels ever made. Underworld evolution has Kate beckinsale and Scott Speedman returning as Selene and Michael an ex-death dealer and a hybrid, this time around Selene and Michael are trying to stop Marcus Crovinus the very first vampire form releasing his twin brother William Crovinus the first Lycan. This story picks up exactly where the first left off (which most sequels don't.) Selene and Michael are on the run from both the vampire and lycan covens, Viktor is dead killed by Selene, Amelia was killed by the Lycans during Kravens betrayal. That only leave Marcus as the remaining elder and the ruler of the vampire clan. Now with Viktor out of the way there will be nobody to stop Marcus from plunging the world into total and complete chaos. Now Selene and Michael have but one objective, to stop Marcus and William Crovinous from destroying the human race. Underworld evolution is a heart pounding, mind blowing assault on the senses, it's a film you can watch over and over again and still love ever minute of it, it's better than the first and perhaps the best in the series. I hope my thoughts help~C.R. Lopez 2/6/2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Len Wiseman (Die Hard 4.0), this sequel is not any different in terms of quality, it again just doesn't do very well. You may remember how in the last film, Selene (Van Helsing's Kate Beckinsale) woke up Viktor (Bill Nighy) in hope to help end the war, and he betrayed the vampire side, oh, and also Michael (Scott Speedman) became a vampire/Lycan (werewolf) hybrid, well, the story pretty much continues with those facts in mind. This time Selene is trying to stop the original Lycan, William (Brian Steele), released from centuries of imprisonment, and we learn that years ago, he and his brother Marcus (Tony Curran) began the bloodline of vampires and werewolves, and their immortal father Alexander Corvinus (Derek Jacobi) wants Selene and Michael to put a stop to them and (hopefully) the war. Also starring Michael Sheen (archive footage mainly) as Lucian, Steven Mackintosh as Tanis, Shane Brolly as Kraven and Scott McElroy as Soren. The special effects as with the previous are still not bad, but again don't really add much to the story, which is still pretty unoriginal, the only moment that caught my eye most was Beckinsale's great looking body (covering breasts and bum of course) during a sex scene. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It amazes me that a film as wholly unoriginal as this can get made and why would someone pay to watch it.People will go an see it because they are stupid and undiscerning (an overriding problem resulting in the failure of our species) by the time they realise (assuming they do) they've been duped into seeing bits of Blade and the Matrix badly remade its too late, the bankers have the money.By the way when I say talent I'm not referring to the actors, writers or directors but the CGI artists, DoP, Art Directors etc (who are this films only saving grace) who could be put to work on something original and entertaining.That's not to say Wiseman has no talent he obviously has the ability to network and convince people to invest in sh it like this, I suppose as well he can project manage as the ultimate indictment of such a film is its unemotional workmanlike construction.Finally I suspect him and other overrated average directors (ie James Cameron and Wes Craven) are only in the business to be in the business, not because they love film which makes me angry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly impressive sequel effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Underworld: Evolution" isn't all that bad and is a really decent movie.**SPOILERS**Going on the run from the vampires and werewolves, Selene, (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin, (Scott Speedman) who each want both dead, until Michael grows stronger from his change. Vampire master Marcus Corvinus, (Tony Curran) is awaken from his slumber and sets out on hunting Selene and Michael down. Going into hiding, they seek Andreas Tanis, (Steven Mackintosh) a reclusive vampire, and are able to learn the truth about the bloodlines of both species. Relying on his information as well as from their father, Alexander Corvinus, (Sir Derek Jacobi) they race to stop Marcus before he releases his brother William, (Brian Steele) and ushers in his plan to rule the world.The Good News: This actually surprised me with some decent stuff. One of the best things is the upped gore content in the film. There's plenty of blood flow in here and is nicely covered by both sides. Even with the enormous amounts of gunfire in the film, which cuts up both pretty well, there's a lot of additional blood to be found. There's body parts being impaled with everything possible, including barbed wing tips, swords, knives and crossbows, decapitations with many of those same weapons, body parts sliced up with various gusto, a large amount of scratches and neck bites and more. With the addition of blood flow and splashes thrown in with them, it's a decent enough look for gore-hounds, who will find lots to love about this one. Aside from the gore, one of the best parts of the movie is the intense and hyper-accelerated action sequences, which makes it all the better. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the best might be the opening flashback on the village assault. A group of vampires wanders into a village of werewolves, they start to get attacked by the transforming victims and a large-scale fight occurs that is breathtaking in it's ambition and pace. Limbs fly everywhere, blood-splatters against anything in it's path, and weapons are utilized to great extent, with each side taking huge losses in the battle. With some great ideas and execution, it opens the film in great fashion and sets the tone it will follow afterward. The truck-chase also works well, thanks to a couple of clever little scenes inside that drive up the suspense for it and doesn't stop the fact that it's a great action sequence any less. The only scene that might top the beginning of the film in the action stakes is the ending, which is of the spectacle not normally seen in a horror film and features tons of stand-out moments in it that will linger for awhile. That some of those involve a helicopter sequence that's not to be missed is a great example and one that leaves a large mark. There's really no stop to them either, as they come flying one after another in a long series of sequences that serve as excuses to use them. There's very little down-time between everything, and it constantly throws a series of action scenes together is nicely appreciated. There is still a lot to like in the creature's make-up, especially the werewolves. They really look great in here, with the large powerful bodies and huge heads from the first one but a minor change in the facial rearranging done to make them more wolf-like. Another new feature is some additional body hair that comes up in new areas, and is another nice addition to making them more menacing. This also extends to the main villain, who has a great design and looks really good. The wing-tips look great and are a great plus, and with the demonic face, make for a great monster. Throw in some suspenseful stalking sequences and this is a much better sequel than it should've been.The Bad News: There is really only a couple of things wrong with this one, and they're not that bad. The main one is that the film really makes no sense. By tying up all the story lines is a much needed affair, but it really leaves the film to hung up on it's talkier side between action sequences. The fact that all of them are supposedly tied up at the same point is another problem, since it requires knowledge of what happened before and from the first movie, and to keep track of three or four separate ones is a little taxing. For such a strong creature, it really never treats Michael all great, since all he really does is get knocked out and force the other characters to keep him alive. It doesn't inspire a great deal of threat and menace from him. The last big problem is the same one that hampered the first one, which is that the highly stylized look to the film doesn't do it much favor. It's glossy for the appeal to the viewer and not to help the story out much, and it gets tiresome having to constantly stare at it in that fashion. But otherwise, this wasn't all that bad.The Final Verdict: There wasn't a whole lot to dislike in this one, and it's a better film than it's predecessor. While there aren't a lot of flaws, the ones that are there are noticeable and keep it from being a perfect film, but it's still a no-brainer for fans of the first one to check this out as soon as possible.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, a sex scene and violence against animals</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, I think is actually a disappointment compared to the 1st Underworld, but don't get me wrong it is still good and watchable. Kate Beckinsale really knocks one out of the park with her tight black leather latex tights and her slick and hot body and Scott Speedman is really quite good looking for a man. I really enjoyed this movie a lot with the extraordinary action and breathtaking special effects but it's just basically a whole movie of non-stop action. I mean we gotta have a little info on how it's going and why it's going this way. But if you like werewolves and love vampires you will definitely love this film of action. I am just warning you, don't expect to much, because it's not as good as the first film.</fullReview>

WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG wrong!!! Besides this, the movie was pretty 'meh'...nothing special. Some good effects, but they couldn't save it for me.

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) The story line didn't really tempt me. I was left wondering who many of the characters were and what their part in the whole thing was. I feel we go from Selene and Michael running from vampires who are angry about Viktor's death to running from Markus all too fast. Nowhere did it surprise me. There are very predictable "twists" all throughout, such as Michael's resurrection. Worst of all were the graphics. I felt like I was watching graphics from about 2-3 decades ago, particularly when they showed the lycan transformations. And not to be overly picky- but the love scene was poorly done as well in the sense that the positioning would be impossible in real life. Maybe he's different now that he's a hybrid? lol! At least try to make it look right.Overall, not worth the time. But does smell of sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution starts in 1202 A.D. where a Vampire named Marcus (Tony Curran) uses the army of Viktor (Bill Nighy) to capture his uncontrollable Werewolf Brother William (Brian Steele), Marcus demands that William is unharmed &amp; as such he is imprisoned in a tomb specifically constructed for such a purpose. Jump forward to the present &amp; amongst the Werewolf Vampire war that has raged for centuries sexy Vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has been betrayed by her own kind &amp; is now on the run with Michael (Scott Speedman) who is a Werewolf Vampire hybrid. Meanwhile Marcus is now a winged Vampire bat monster thing &amp; wants to free his Brother William but needs two 'keys' that are shaped as amulets, his Father Alexander (Sir Derek Jacobi) holds one &amp; Selene has the other &amp; since it was her Father who built the tomb Selene is the only living (well in a 500 year old Vampire sense anyway) person who knows where it is. Marcus sets out on a violent quest to find Selene, retrieve the keys, find out where the tomb is, release his Brother &amp; use him to create a new breed of hybrid creature to take over the Earth. However, Selene has different ideas...Directed by Len Wiseman Underworld: Evolution is a sequel to the modestly successful Underworld (2003) which I have to admit I have not seen, I still really liked this film though. The script by executive producer Danny McBride moves along like a rocket &amp; is full of gore, monsters, action, explosions, gun fights, chases &amp; Kate Beckinsale running around in tight fitting rubber outfits packing some serious weaponry &amp; kicking ass which all adds up to a great time as far as I'm concerned, hey I'm easily pleased! I like the visual style, the character's &amp; dialogue were as good as they needed to be while there's a certain seriousness about it that works. The one real negative aspect of Underworld: Evolution is that I found the story &amp; mythology behind it quite tough going for the first half as it refers to events &amp; character's in the previous film which I haven't seen &amp; therefore felt a little lost at times although the mindless action &amp; gore along with Kate Beckinsale fighting monsters in a rubber outfit makes up for it, it's not as easy to get into as say the mythology behind the Blade (1998 - 2004) films which Underworld: Evolutions has more than a passing resemblance to in it's style &amp; structure with Vampires living amongst humans. A lot of theatrical films lately seem to run for well over 2 hours &amp; I personally don't like long films because I just bore easily so I'm delighted to report that Underworld: Evolutions runs for little more than 100 minutes which for me is far more manageable &amp; is another definite plus. As simple, undemanding, fun, entertaining, action packed mindless comic book violence I doubt you'll find much better out there, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.Director Wiseman turns in a stylish film, everything has a light blue tone to it almost as if all the colour has been bleached from the picture. I also noticed that the colour of character's eye's was enhanced &amp; stood out which I thought looked pretty cool. There's plenty of cool angles &amp; neat camera work, Underworld: Evolutions is damned nice to look at. The film is packed with great set pieces &amp; action scenes, from ultra violent The Matrix (1999) style CGI stuffed fights to shoot-outs &amp; a great sequence where Beckinsale is trying to outrun a winged monster in a speeding truck. The sets are gorgeous &amp; the way their lit as well, the monsters are cool &amp; are a mixture of CGI &amp; traditional make-up effects. The obligatory arsenal of weapons is also present, from chromed crossbows to stylish handguns to shotguns &amp; blades such as throwing stars, swords &amp; knives, I'm not sure I agree with the glamorisation of dangerous weaponry but what the hell they still look cool especially when Beckinsale uses them. There's blood &amp; gore aplenty here, impalings, exploding heads, neck biting, slit wrists, stabbings, blood soaked fights &amp; generally speaking the filmmakers weren't afraid to splash the red stuff around as it's here by the bucket load.With a modest sounding budget of about $50,000,000 Underworld: Evolutions looks fantastic with great production design &amp; a real dark Gothic feel to it that I loved. The special effects are great, the cinematography is stylish &amp; it's well made. The acting is OK &amp; a special mention goes to the designer of Kate Beckinsale's outfit which she looks gorgeous in &amp; as far as I'm concerned probably worth watching the film on it's own, but then again I'm easily pleased &amp; a bit of a pervert.Underworld: Evolutions is pure entertainment, if you don't like violence or gore then forget it but if your up for a little comic book action then Underworld: Evolution should be at the very top of your list. It's a great watch &amp; I can't really recommend it any higher, brilliant but violent fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when horror means horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Underworld and thought it was a wet dream for all lovers of styled horror movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula ( perhaps the founding film of lavish and well acted horror flicks). Underworld:Evolution hist like a orgy of dark and blood soaked realism that tends to fuse orchestration from Cradle of Filth with VNV-Nation. I liked the sequel equally as the original. The overall darkness en lighting styling is superb and the whole atmosphere is crowded with stunning impressions of fantasy and gore. There was only one flaw in my view and that are the flashbacks. In the first movie they were of a wind torn quality ,now they are to narrative as in a dream profiler series. A good sign for the overall impression was that all the original actors are in the sequel once again.I hope there will be a third installment!!For reference: I loved Resident evil ,but abhorred the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Evolution...not sure it really was an evolution in terms of the plot. The music was better in the first movie (which I've seen 50 times??), as was the main story line. This story line worked hard at being clever, but it never really WAS clever. I thought the beginning was really funny, in that Celine was trying to actually GET BACK to the mansion. The first movie clearly noted that she and Michael were on the run from both of their kinds of people. Where did that plot line go? Mid stream, she turns and goes back to the hide out where Mr. Hybrid was? And then at the end, when Celine turns into some "future" hybrid, when did her transformation take place? Each creature clearly transformed into something evolved, right? So, with Celine...when did she transform? I also read about the threesome in the middle of the movie in terms of a sex scene. I was ready to be grossed out, but it actually was quite tame. Probably not the fantasy every guy imagined there, for sure. However, every male I knew who saw this movie just adored Celine. I really liked the gore scenes. I know, a chick who likes gore! Amazing. I wish they'd shot more of those. I also liked the scene where Celine fought the human soldiers/police in the forest at the beginning of the movie. I wish they'd done more of that as well. The flow of the movie would have been far better if they'd shot the movie with more of the "other world mutant" body movements as well....think fast and furious. Wonder if they'll get the financial backing to make a third?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie and am shocked. So lame I couldn't believe it. I was amazed by the first movie, I loved the plot, characters and action scenes. The sequel didn't come even close to it. The plot is terrible, raising up every man to a superior being, predictable hunt for an unseen beast (as if they wanted to raise expectations), stupid and simple dialogues, short and unimpressive action scenes and all this cocktail was topped up with a worthless love scene. The movie is not consistent at all, it jumps between history lessons action scenes and moving the characters. Kate and Scot are quite nice duo though, but their characters lack development. A few times I thought that this could be just deleted scenes from the first movie. And finally the end (I couldn't wait to get to it) - very short, the two mighty brothers taken down in a way my little sister could do it herself. No challenge, no thrill, it remained of a bar-fight rather than vampire/lykan fight.Definitely a big disappointing, I give it 4 just because I like Kate, there were 2 or 3 good shots and Tony Curran was a very nice villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare Case of Sequel better than Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie delivers. Fantastic visual effects, high flying stunts and a beautiful cast all filmed in a dark, gritty, blued out screen make this an eye candy treat. As of right now, May 22, 2006, this is the best movie of the year.Selene returns with her sidekick and love interest, Michael Corvin (played by Scott Speedman) as they are on the run from the vengeful vampires they betrayed in the first film. However, the plot complicates as the original vampire, Marcus is released into the world and he seeks the release of his werewolf brother, William, from his eternal prison. Turns out, Selene carries in her blood the secret to unlocking William and thus begins the cat and mouse game between her and Marcus.With some real stunning action sequences and magnificent sets, this film shies away from the brooding, goth feel of the first one and centers on giving us a knock 'em down, drag em out adventure. Marcus's makeup as the bat winged, hulking vampire is a sheer delight. The scene as he chases the two heroes in a truck on a winding, mountain road is movie magic. The climatic final battle as Selene and Michael engage Marcus and William is pure, gory entertainment. This movie is FUN.The plot and dialog play a secondary role to the action scenes and the writer and director are smart enough to know this. The first one dragged in several areas with a slow moving plot that bogged down with it's sheer complexity. This is corrected in the sequel making this a superior film. Moviegoer's seeking fantasy escapism, look no further.To say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie is an understatement. In a terrible year of movies so far, smart action flicks like Underworld: Evolution and V for Vendetta are really given a chance to shine. Let us pray for more</fullReview>

Apart from the really nice sex scene there truly isn't much that in any way improved the original. Every character from there is either dead or winds up dead after 2 minutes of screen time. And that's the biggest flaw this movie makes, it gets really impersonal, less than 15 actors are in it altogether and I don't care for anybody except for Selena. She's still fabulous and is the blue-eyed latex queen of them all. Not really sure if it's worth a try if you liked the original as much as I did, but "Evolution" won't really let you down either.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution My rating: 8/10 The plot: We find out more about the history of the long-time war between lycans (werewolves) and vampires, while Selene and Michael are still on the run ?now being tracked down by a new enemy; the recently "awakened" Marcus, who, incidentally was the very first vampire.Only one word to describe it; Wow! The first Underworld was a great movie, but this one surpasses all of my expectations, especially since there are more action sequences, more characters, more background information about the whole "werewolves v/s vampires" saga and in my opinion, this movie is more gripping than the previous venture. The additional benefit is that the movie starts off with a short summary of the events that occurred in the first installment, which means that anyone can easily understand what's happening without getting too confused (whether they have seen the first movie or not). However, the storyline is a bit weak, compared to that of "Underworld" 1 (which seems to be the case for many sequels, so I don't blame the director). So if you are a big-time "Underworld" fan, and don't care much about having an absolutely flawless plot, then this movie is a MUST-SEE for you. On the other hand if you don't like "dark" movies involving creatures like vampires, werewolves etc, and which are somewhat violent, then you'd better stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it is an improvement...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but that is akin to saying tofu is an improvement upon moldy bread. Neither are particularly desirable, but one has some redeeming value, as unsure as I am of what it is. Thus, we get to the problem that will plague the entire Underworld series as it progresses through straight-to-video, television, and even Saturday morning cartoon formats. By setting itself such a mediocre standard in the opening film, Underworld: Evolution has a long way to go before it even becomes average. To be fair, it appears that the makers have learned from the biggest mistake of the first film, and have made the pacing far more even this time. To answer the big question anyone who has sat through the original will ask, this is not an action-intensive beginning and end with a sleeping pill of a middle. But when one is finding it difficult to care about the primary characters, any lapse in the action immediately follows Einstein's theory of relativity. The action scenes are the equivalent of spending an hour with a beautiful woman. The dialogue scenes are the equivalent of having your butt stuck to a stove for a second.Kate Beckinsale is in better form this time as Selene, the vampire soldier around which the action revolves. Unfortunately, as we are given a string of disorienting flashbacks to further develop the story, we are given a sense that the same handful of characters were around for every significant event in werewolf/vampire history. To say this is stretching probability a tad would probably be redundant. Even more perplexing is how in spite of having lived through several cultural and societal shifts of history, everyone in the film dresses and speaks like they were born in 1980 or thereabouts, even when they are clearly over fifty years in age. This sequel also goes to further undermine the canon by making hybrids non-unique, in spite of the presumably centuries that the werewolves spent researching the topic without success. Indeed, a lot of the story and revelations we get here contradict what was set down in the original, and not in a seamless or even inspired manner.Getting back to Beckinsale's performance, however, it seems that the director and writer were well aware of how little they had to attract the viewer this time around. And so, without much ceremony, Beckinsale is called upon to disrobe for one brief but strangely interesting scene. Although it does take the film back into the realm of spending an hour with a beautiful woman, the quest to track down the significance of a certain pendant soon puts the whole affair back into the effect of sticking one's hand in a tub of boiling water. I genuinely believe that studios would get much better feedback if they ditched the focus groups and just took note of how many times I check my wristwatch during parts of a given film. The middle hour of Underworld: Evolution, racked up an even dozen. By comparison, X-Men 2 had a watch-checking factor of zero on the first viewing. Put simply, Kate Beckinsale is not able to carry a film on her own. Given that she has had multiple films with significant amounts of screen time devoted to her now, I think it is safe to say she will not ever be.Among Evolution's improvements are a less choppy editing style for the present-day scenes. The story flows smoothly rather than like a collection of deleted scenes, and the cinematography is far less intrusive. Angles are chosen according to what the viewer will see rather than what will look cool. This does not help the fact that Len Wiseman's ability to compose scenes is still mediocre at best, but compared to the eMpTyV style of composition in the original, it is an improvement. Now, if they could just do away with the lens filter in the flashbacks, or better yet dispense with the flashbacks entirely, the watchability factor would increase quite dramatically. Unfortunately, the one factor that keeps Underworld and its spawn from being good films, namely a good screenplay, keeps eluding the writers. Apparently aware that everyone saw through the idea that people did not lavish praise on the original Underworld because they did not "get" the Lycan terminology, Evolution dumbs it all down a notch. Perhaps someone at Screen Gems took Danny McBride aside and informed him that this material was not going to have legs with an adult audience.When all is said and done, Underworld: Evolution is a four out of ten film. It tries so hard to reach an audience that it knows is out there, but it falls so short. Granted, the fall is somewhat less hard than was the case with the original, but the fact that this is essentially a second draft makes the failure even more disappointing. While it is not one long chunk of exposition with action scenes tacked onto both ends, one has to ask if this really is the best they can do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to repeat all the mistakes mentioned before, but rest assured, I agree with every single one. Just to bring up a few others the first movie was filmed partly in Hungary which seemed natural, as the story is taking place here (sort of) but then why couldn't they just do it again? First of all, it kind of hurt to hear the locals speak the language with obvious accents of people who haven't been to their home country for quite a few years. And then again, why exactly did they have to speak Hungarian in the English dubbed version? Aren't they the locals? I mean I understood the policemen and the television announcer, but I wasn't supposed to. (I wonder what English speakers made of those scenes without any subtitle). So if it is supposed to take place in Hungary, and every character is Hungarian why do the locals have to speak in an "exotic" language? The other thing I just realized is, that it makes a difference who you are fighting with. When Selene is fired at by the policemen in the woods, she just leans away from the bullets. But if someone with supernatural strength and/or speed pulls the trigger, you can't be fast enough to get away clean. Strange heroic physics. But never mind. this movie was as bad as it could be. Come to think of it, I should've appreciated the effort put in by the makers to massacre a movie with so much potential as this. If I wasn't too tired I'd still be shaking from the shock of this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Like The Original -- But Without the Glamor, Allure, and Excitement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original and was really hoping the second movie would be as sexy and stylish as the first. I am a HUGE Kate Beckinsale fan (like most men) and she looks just as fabulous as ever. But a lot of the background elements have been changed, and this movie really suffers.UNDERWORLD had a sexy, stylish, film noir setting. In a decadent and luxurious mansion, there are languid, pleasure loving, sexy male and female vampires, dressed in the height of fashion. In this crowd, Selene stands out as deliciously unique. She is sexy because she is so very cool and self-sufficient. She is obviously desired by all of them, especially Craven, the coven leader. And when she brings her human captive home with her, everyone assumes she's finally given into passion! "The whole house is simply buzzing about your new pet," a stunning vampire girl whispers.This enticing aroma of heated, yet sophisticated sexual tension is totally absent from this UNDERWORLD sequel. Instead of having sex in the city, Selene and her lover Michael just wander through the woods most of the time, with no one to watch or care about their relationship at all. The sexual tension between them seems to have been sucked out between the movies -- largely because there is no longer a coven of vampires in a city setting to provide the rich, gossipy background.Instead we are in the woods, with nothing but chase scenes and fight scenes -- many of them clumsy, some unintentionally hilarious. Check out the "race" between a speeding Mack Truck and a fifteen foot tall gargoyle! Flap . . . flap . . . flap . . . "pull over, y'all!" It's like SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT meets VAN HELSING! Then there's the "paint by numbers" scene where Michael has to "light proof" the hiding place by randomly throwing paint on the windows . . . for five minutes! And this was crucial to the plot how? Then there's the great "Diner" scene, where Kate tells Michael, "darling, whatever you do, don't eat human food . . . at least not at certain restaurants." Scott Speedman has limits as an actor, but he's utterly convincing as a man who eats a bunch of potatoes, then pukes. "Can you tell, what I am now? No? I'm a ZIT!" "I'm sorry, I'm a werewolf. Do you have any kosher werewolf food?" "No werewolf food. Cheeseburger. Come on, come on, we gotta have turnover. Cheeseburger,cheeseburger, cheeseburger!" To sum up the problem, it is obvious that nobody making this film understood what audiences liked about the original. Those of us who came away from the first movie fascinated and intrigued are the ones most likely to be puzzled and disgusted by this one.A big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would of thought January would be a good month for movies? Two weeks ago saw the release of GRANDMA'S BOY, the funniest comedy to come out in the 2000s yet and this week brings UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION, a sequel that is *gasp* better than the original. Finding a sequel as good or better than the original is, pardon the old expression, like finding a needle in a haystack. It just doesn't happen very often, which what makes UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION such a treat. It's bigger and better the original. This is no doubt because the cast members are more suited in their roles than they were before and because with his second feature, Len Wiseman has grown as a director. Also improved are the special effects that appeared somewhat fake in the original film. If 'EVOLUTION' was only about special effects like mostly all action pictures today, it would be no good, but thanks to screenwriter Danny McBride and Wiseman, there is actually a good story behind the mayhem. Were there weak points? Just a couple. The chemistry between Selene and Michael seemed a bit off at times. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If must say that the Underworld movies are enjoyable if you love vampires, werewolves, sci-fi and a LOT of fighting. I love how they re-invented the vampire and the werewolf, I like how the vampires look and the werewolves are alright too. The whole world looks dark and grey, with rain and snow everywhere which obviously helps the atmosphere become more haunted and vampiresque.It's just that there is one thing missing: emotions and character development. The whole movie centers around a big problem that vampire Selene and her hybrid boyfriend have to solve. They move from the one place to the other, looking for clues to find out the truth. Obviously people are following them and trying to stop them and they have to kick some ass and continue their journey. It is enjoyable and the story is really really good, it's just that you don't really feel anything because the characters are just all very dull. Selene is the child trauma serious girl, which is boring and dull after a while. She only cares about her boyfriend, but other than that she is no fun, no good lines and not even some sarcasm. She barely shows affection for Michael (except for the parts they are all over each other) but not really any conversations that might point out that they are in a relationship. Almost all characters are designed like that, they all look like robots to me and that is why I just can't say that Underworld is a favorite. I watched a lot of vamp movies and I must say that I wouldn't recommend Underworld as a personal fav, I would just say that the story is nice and there is a lot of ass kicking violence in it. I will continue with the rest of the movies, hopefully they suddenly change their ways!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the first "Underworld" movie some years ago, I described it as a Gothic diamond in the rough, a hidden gem that just needed a bit more polishing for a possible sequel. Lo and behold, a sequel duly appeared and I can think of few films with quite so much polish as this one. So the question is, am I satisfied with this one? Well, yes but not as much as I'd hoped for. The amount of action has increased and the CG effects have been improved but the muddled fog around the plot remains and there aren't many bones to hang the meat on. If you've not seen the first film then don't bother with this - I know it's been a while but I struggled to get up to speed.The war between vampires and Lycans has intensified after the events of the first film. Beautiful vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and half-human hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run after killing Viktor (Bill Nighy). Selene believes that their only hope lies with demonic vampire ancestor Marcus (Tony Curran) but alas, he has other plans concerning his werewolf brother William. Determined to wake his brother from his prison, Marcus searches for the location of his brother but the only one who knows is the only one who can stop him - Selene.Feeling even more like "The Matrix" than before, "Underworld: Evolution" offers considerably more bang for your buck than the overly talkie first one. All the gun fights and fisticuffs are still there and for a action buff like myself, they're pretty good. The trouble is the plot which befuddles things and never really makes a great deal of sense which is a shame because beneath the prosthetics, performances aren't too shabby. Beckinsale still feels an odd choice for an action heroine but she's not too distracting, despite the shiny black catsuit. But the film doesn't feel like a horror flick, more a action-packed fantasy film designed to appeal to teenage boys - not unlike "The Matrix". But with a film like this, I wanted it to focus on being more like "The Crow" but this feels too polished and clinical, like a pop video."Underworld: Evolution" feels more like the film the first one wanted to be but personally, I enjoyed the first one more. It still feels unusual seeing vampires with machine guns - especially as it doesn't appear to damage characters in any way, shape or form - but this is a decent enough action flick with plenty to offer, even if it doesn't make much sense. It also feels like a proper vampire film compared to tweeny pish like "Twilight" and that really is something to celebrate. I just wished that it offered something else besides frequent gun battles, CG beasties going at it and something close to character development because I didn't spot anything besides a rather pointless sex scene. Still, it is entertaining and better than a host of other vampire flicks out there so why not take a punt?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my thought about the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an excellent sequel on the first one, the film remains interesting, though the action of the previous film is found. It keeps you hanging on your screen until the end. It takes you, as viewer, into the heart of the movie. With the dead of Michael you feel exactly the same feelings as Selene, hate for the one who killed him and sorrow for losing him. But some scene's are cliché, like Michael getting back to live when Selene needs him the most. But that just oh so romantic about it. The clichés don't bother me at all, it gives just that little bit more to the film. A film without clichés isn't a film I believe, you need to know a bit from what's going to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of things I could fault Len Wiseman with, but I'll single out the one that annoys me the most. His movies are melodramatic to the point of being unenjoyable. Nobody laughs in this movie, and what very little comic relief exists is horribly stilted and out of place. Since when does a serious movie have to be so watertight that watching it is the equivalent of holding your breath for two hours? Aliens and Terminator 2 were sober action flicks, but they found time to let the audience laugh.I loathe the dialogue. It's a hideous bastardization of Shakespearean form that makes me want to scream. The complete lack of emotion in the majority of the film makes the few emotional scenes feel alien. We're in the twenty-first century, for crying out loud. People don't talk like this. They never did, for that matter. Stop trying to make classy movies out of train wrecks! There's a lot more CGI in this movie, and it looks terrible by modern standards. I felt that the first movie utilized CGI rather well, mixing it with prosthetics and other techniques to hide its presence. Evolution, on the other hand, unleashes a barrage of CGI that looks rushed and underdeveloped.There are a few great actors here, but none of them are used to their full potential. Bill Nighy and Derek Jacobi are the only ones to even come close to showing off their abilities, but neither of them get enough screen time to make lasting impressions.I feel like what happened with Underworld is like what happened with the Matrix. The makers thought they could only make one movie and had too much story, so they shaved off what they felt they could do without. Then, when they got their chance to make another movie, they had more money but less story than before. Naively, they must have believed the two would balance each other out, which may prove true at the box office, but not for the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Underworld" series is perhaps the only high-quality movie franchise based on either a computer game or a comic book (sorry, nerds... GRAPHIC NOVEL). I was very surprised that I actually found myself enjoying both films, considering that I am usually bored by these types of modern commercial fantasy-action films, plus the fact that I consider vampire/werewolf-themed horror films to be a dead genre. (Fangs are dull, dogs are dull.) The plot in U2 is not as full of twists as in the first installment, but the visual slickness and the fun action scenes are still there. The "Underworld" movies are far better than "Blade" and "Van Helsing" combined. There should be an "Underworld 3"; after all, if "X-Men" gets to be a trilogy, then ANY franchise deserves to be one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a war between werewolves and vampires was this dull, it's hard to point out why the original wouldn't have been enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: It's too bad they couldn't make this monster mash any more entertaining than a video-game on the big-screen. Boy, we've been having some really bad movies these days. Part of the fun, though, is trying to guess which movies will turn out badly. One of the movies I picture to be bad was UNDERWORLD:EVOLUTION, and my "premonition" seemed correct. This film is a sequel to UNDERWORLD, a surprise fan favorite but I couldn't say it was either bad or good, because I haven't seen it yet. But I did see this one, on a night time showing, and then I began seeing endless reruns on this. Then I ask myself: "Why do they keep releasing this?" If a war between werewolves and vampires was this dull, it's hard to point out why the original would have been enough. For the sake of all you fans out there, let me get it straight that I did not like this film.From what I understand, the story is about a war between the race of vampires and Lycans (werewolves). Amidst this war, a unlikely relationship grows between Selene(played by Kate Beckinsale), a female vampire, and Michael (Scott Speedman), a werewolf hybrid. But this story wasn't well expressed, as I felt, when they just chose to show every visual, every special effect, and just turn it into a bloated, messed-up, low-rent MATRIX crossed with VAN HELSING. The characters are uninteresting, as is the story. The creativity all went to where it usually goes, to the effects and the pseudo-cool stunts, which weren't at all terrific to start with. We just have a lot crashes, blood spray , flying vampires and guys turning into werewolves, even if the plot doesn't all call for it.The only thing, perhaps, that is interesting is the make-up. Thankfully, they kept this tradition from the low-budget original instead of just turning them into CGI drones.Director Len Wiseman (whose middle name may be "Excess") has skill in making the action sequences, but it's something that I really don't care about in this film. You can blow up a lot of things, do car crashes , all day, but as long as it means nothing, it's worth nothing or unnecessary. But I think it would be worth something if he did it well, but he didn't. The action belongs to some other movies since the plot is about werewolves and vampires.There are so many things that I don't about this film, so I'll just end it by saying I did not like this film and don't intent to recommend it (but if you're a fan, I can't stop you from watching it). I give it at least *.Rating: * out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution (2006)Review: I did not much care for the first Underworld. So my expectations were rather low for the sequel. How is this? Here's my Take:Underworld: Evolution is quite the surprise. We start off with a pretty cool sequence of action and plot development. The first twenty minuets are more than enough to keep you satisfied. Our heroes are more developed and are much more interesting here.From what I have gathered, the key differences from the first installment to this is very telling. First is this movie has much more emotion. There are a few pretty emotional scenes here and get rather gripping. There is far more action. The action is intense and really graphic, but is focused and well executed. The plot is hard to understand at first till one point, all is figured out quickly. It's actually good. A fine story too. Not to mention, character development is here, but not too much. A little more would be nice.There is one rather alluring sex scene here too. I cannot believe how much skin was seen here. Beckinsale is certainly well taken care of. An attractive cast indeed.The Last Word: Excellent. Underworld: Evolution beat my expectations by miles. In my opinion, the first installment was rather bland, this more than makes up for that. Perhaps there will be hope for the franchise after all. I would like to see more Underworld. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

Kate Beckinsale is even more magnificent in the role and Michael Speedman's character is given a lot more depth as well. Of course the very special treat in this film is the addition of Sir Derrick Jacoby, an actor of enormous dimension. You cannot fault any of the action sequences and the special effects go way beyond the first film as well. With the opening set back at the very beginning we come to understand much more about how it all came to be in the beginning. The rest of the cast are equally up to the task, and the film is suitably gory for those who like a gore fest, without actually wallowing in it. If you liked Underworld, you are going to love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a man who demands much from a piece of bubblegum entertainment, give me some explosions and gun violence along with the occasional semblance of a plot and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Equally I am not without my nerdish tendencies; I take a kind of guilty pleasure in movies that have their own fantastic worlds and rules. As such I am a part of the target audience for this movie, not part of the hardcore, scary "let's get dressed up and pretend to cast spells" crowd but I was willing to part with a few quid to see this, as I had with the prequel. I had been a bit nonplussed by the first film, it just looked like a cheap knock off of something that I had seen done better and more humorously before, but I could see why it had its appeal to some.On the other hand this turgid piece of awfulness is unforgivable. I have seen movies that are equally poorly made and thought out but I have never seen one that is held in such high regard; the general consensus being that this is an improvement on its predecessor. The fact that I had had my expectations raised by a variety of none too trustworthy sources may have served to agitate me even further but, bare in mind, this came after the mind boggling pantsness of everything about this film began to reveal itself.Firstly we have the plot. It was always going to be absolute nonsense but it could have at least been brief or, heaven forbid, interesting. There are just too many characters with too much to say. For every five minutes of PVC gunporn and gratuitous violence there seems to be ten minutes of painfully badly written exposition. Whole characters exist purely to tell the audience what's going on and even at that I found it impossible to follow because, unlike the writer (but much like the rest of humanity), I didn't give a toss. Characters are given motivations that require flashbacks within flashbacks in order to explain who did what to who and when it happened. No matter how interesting and complex the world of this film series may be it is being destroyed by a writer who has no flare for writing and, crucially, no understanding of how to tell a story with anything resembling subtlety.Beyond the fact that the very core of the film is entirely piddle we have the direction. No two scenes meld together. we veer from impressive action set pieces full of bang, wallop and pop into a variety of ill fitting filler scenes. From awful "Tastefully Filmed" love scenes to even more awful Shakespeare-Lite patricide (which, the nerd in me must add, is exactly the same as a scene from Blade II, a film which exemplifies what can be good about this type of nonsense if it is handled with a light touch and a knack for storytelling) the film has no pace. All momentum that is built with impressive special effects and action sequences is lost because the director doesn't know how to do the bits in between and the writer is filling them with awful dialogue trying to explain everything all at once.So, in summary, this film exemplifies the "well the first one did OK so let's make another" mentality combined with a production process where, apparently, nobody bothered to read the script because, if they had, they surely would have realised that it's rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guns and fighting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>don't make a good movie. It takes a decent story also, which this movie lacks. Why are guns the weapon of choice for Selene in fighting werewolves and vampires. I mean, she doesn't even use silver bullets. Shooting 20 shots at a werewolf doesn't kill it. Some of the special effects were OK, but some were cartoonish. There are some good gore scenes for all the gore freaks. How can you not like when the badest werewolf gets the top part of his head and jaw torn off. Also the badest vampire gets ground up by a helicopter blade. Cool. Question: Why didn't the father of the original vampire and werewolf do anything to try to stop them? He seemed to want to help Selene but used the ole they are my children, I can't hurt them? What? He didn't want them to succeed.Seeing this also makes you feel for poor Scott Speedman, who once had a promising career on Felicity. Now, he can't even get a lead role in any film since the first Underworld. Of course, he doesn't have much acting talent and should go back to TV.FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you liked the first one, you would like this. But for the average viewer, it doesn't have enough of a story to hold your interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So cool, they only wore leather!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wowee wowee. Just saw this movie on cable. Man, everyone had such cool names. Soren, Kraven, Corvinus, Sorkraveninus (j/k, lol!). And the costumes, the costumes, I'm betting if vampires were real, they'd only wear skintight leather. That's gotta be real comfy, especially after fighting in the water. Totally functional. And if werewolves were real, they'd never wear shirts too. Just trench coats like in the movie. There's no way anyone would ever notice a guy walking across the street with only a trench coat, going 'commando', even. Nonsensical, I say! I didn't think it was that gory, I mean not like Saving Private Ryan. An old guy getting stabbed by a tentacle, arm, spider leggy thing is totally better than being shot up. That old Corvinus guy was super strong too. He didn't die, for like 10 minutes after he got stabbed by Spiderman. They don't make old guys like that anymore, no sir! This movie does that, and more! And wowee did this movie have A LOT to say! It wasn't like they were doing the same movie again. Instead of fighting a super vampire at the end, they fought a super WEREWOLF! That's just so...super.Kate Beckinsale's character was super cool. There are so, so very few movies where the heroine is strong, cool, and where's skintight clothing while doing crazy martial arts in midair with guns. So very few. I mean, her character's nothing like Lara Croft, or La Femme Nikita, or Alias woman, or Trinity, or Elektra, or Domino, or Catwoman, or BloodRayne, or Stripperella. It's a huge step toward objectification. Wait, objectification is a good thing, right? Those characters are so not one dimensional, they're, like, 5 dimensional or something.My all time favorite part was when Spiderman (or was it Wolverine) pulls down the helicopter by the rope. Totally possible. I mean, rope is totally indestructible, even like the hook it's attached to. In-da-struc-ta-bull. The only problem with the film: more special effects and explosions. There just wasn't enough. Who cares about the story? All we want to see is guns and gals, and in exactly that order. And if Uwe Boll did the movie, that would have made it Oscar worthy, what with the dialogue and talking bits and all. Who would win, BloodRayne or Selene? That's so gotta be in the next one. They could be like long lost twins, like how this movie's got long lost twins. It's just never been done before. Never! That's why I gave it 1/10. For being number 1!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were 19 (which I'm very much not) I'd be shouting "..totally awesome!...". Nevertheless I'd still have to agree with my younger self who relished in the entire grandeur of this movie. It makes such a change to see money spent on well staged locations, quality sets that don't rattle and/or look fake, quality stars who can bothered to earn their fee and a set of minor stars who do a good job in a film of this genre that could have so easily ended up as another B-movie embarrassment. As it is what the team has produced is good quality, adult entertainment for a community that is often fed hi-tech effects with badly acted pap. I agree with some that the story line is basically predictable, and that this does let the film down but the crew have still done a fine job albeit the standard Hollywood screenplay moulding and some weak writing. The sci-fi genre overall does well by this film in my view. It is exciting, adult, intelligent sci-fi/horror - I hope that this team do #3 but do it better still - if that movie were to see a similar progress in the overall quality like I have witnessed from movie 1 to movie 2 then it will be well worth the wait.</fullReview>

I really didn't care for the nude scene but other than that I loved it! It has as much, if not more, gore than the first one and WAY more romance. I was a little sad when one of my favorite characters died in the 1st one but, Marcus defiantly made up for it! I noticed that the werewolves changed in this movie and I didn't care for that but, I did like William a lot. I also enjoyed this one more than the first because it gives you more detail on the creation of the first vampires and werewolves which I really wanted to find out more about after the 1st movie ended. I loved the hybrid in the 1st movie and this one was twice as good because there were 2.

Honestly, a hell of a lot of fans of these types of movies must have voted because this movie is utter garbage! the plot is riduculousy simplistic,basically involving Kate Beckinslae and her side kick Michael trying to avoid Markus, with the killing at the end the result of a painful final scene worthy of a worst final scene ever nomination. I was sittiong their going "no, it cant be that simple surely?". I made a short film at 12 more worthy than that final scene.I had not seen the first movie, but could guess almost any scene that was coming. The sex scenes are rather forced, although beckinsale admittingly is attractive and doesn't do a bad job of acting. The guy who played Michael was a terrible actor however and when he came back to life i cracked up in the theatre. The "bad" guys in the film such as Markus really aren't scary at all. There is absolutely no humour in the film at all, a terrible mistake for all but the very best of films.I'm sure some may be mildly impressed with the special effects but they do not save this disaster of a movie.i give it 1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I reviewed Underworld, the vampire-vs-werewolf sci-fi hit from 2003, I said that the film provoked just enough interest out of me that I would give the sequel a chance. I'm glad I did. This time, the villain is Marcus (Tony Curran, snarling and sniveling appropriately), a disturbing hybrid of vampire and werewolf. With his black eyes and vast wings, Marcus is a monstrous creation, and an ingenious one as well. As Marcus gruesomely kills desiccator's to his grave, the viewer realizes that this sequel is more; bloodier, smarter, faster, stronger, sexier. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman are back, trying to beat Marcus to an amulet that would free his evil brother from his immortal imprisonment. Len Wiseman proves his worth as a director, doing a fine job handling the cluttered storyline, and bringing the action sequences to explosive life. During the final scenes, a helicopter crashes through a rooftop and towards Kate Beckinsale, who dives out of the way, landing in a puddle of water below. This is possibly the best use of the slo-mo technique since the Matrix. Also, Paul Haslinger (whose goth-pop score was out of place in the first film) is replacing by the always excellent Marco Beltrami. Shane Brolly's (Kraven's) appearance in this film is mercifully brief, and Derek Jacobi is outstanding as Alexander Corvinus, the man who spawned the vampire and werewolf bloodlines. Underworld: Evolution is miles ahead of its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION (Len Wiseman, 2006) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to UNDERWORLD (2003) is a more elaborate affair: the original had made effective use of its dark and confined setting - even if the narrative resolved itself with an endless barrage of shoot 'em-ups; this one goes way back to the origin of the vampire/lycanthrope feud, but the plotting is so tortuous that it ends up making little sense (not that anyone really cares one way or the other)!What freshness the presence of gun-toting vampire(!) Kate Beckinsale - clad in skin-tight leather - had possessed, obviously, isn't there the second time around (though she still looks good). The film's deliberately dreary look and the CGI overload are very irritating, however, as is the seemingly omnipotent head vampire/chief villain (with a penchant for stabbing his victims with his over-sized bat wings!). Derek Jacobi's thespian skills are barely whetted with his pivotal but underdeveloped role as the man who 'fathered' both species (by allowing his two 'cursed' sons to live - though he seems to have been monitoring their activities through the ages, even if we're never told to what end!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the first Underworld, so I expected a lot from this one; I wasn't disappointed. The movie picked up right from where the first one ended, and moved at a quick pace through each scene with nary slow parts. They achieved this very well because the story was expounded and progressed easily along with the action sequences. This is a vampire movie, so everything is dark, and they've filtered the colors with a blue tint, and this created an eerily beautiful effect. The werewolves' movements are jerky, but that gives them an evil feel like in 28 Days Later The character development is very thin, of course most of that was taken care of in the first film. This one was did seem very linear and predictable, relying on spectacular effects and action to carry the weight of the film. But, like I said, this doesn't really mean a lot because the first movie covered everything important. Remember in the 80s where every movie had a bunch of small battles culminating in one scene where the protagonist faced off with the "big boss"? Evolution was like an extended big boss scene, only with more revelation and a bigger boss. The ending did leave room for a sequel, but also concludes everything so if they made a sequel they would have to write a new story unrelated except featuring Kate and Scott's characters.I really enjoyed this movie. If you liked the first one, this one is a no-brainer.</fullReview>

I don't want to give too much away, but Selene and Michael pick up pretty much right where they left off in this sequel of the war between the Lycans and the vampires. Selene searches and learns more of the secrets of her family and her bloodline, which only reinforces her convictions that everything she ever thought that she had known was nothing more than a parcel of lies. The founding immortals including the father of the races!) all make an appearance in this one, and the movie starts off by showing us scenes from the past--of how the blood-feud between the two races began in the first place. The movie ends with us realizing that the eternal patience and love for a brother is not necessarily always a good thing. Rather touching and poignant, in a macabre sort of way...Well acted, excellent set decor, awesome FX, amazing stunts, provocative costuming...not to mention an excellent storyline and premise for a sequel--it all adds up to make this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire action flick seems to avoid the mistakes the original made and entertains effectively for its duration.Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene, the vampire out to slay as many werewolves as possible, with Scott Speedman as the unique hybrid of the 2 species Michael.Essentially the background of the war between vampires and werewolves is explored, so we start to understand what caused the current day conflict between them.2 brothers, one of which is vampire (Marcus) and the other being wolf (William) spawned the whole shebang, and Evolution sees Selena trying to stop Marcus from re-awakening his imprisoned brother.As is usual for these vampire style flicks, it's all quite confusing, but to their credit, not quite as baffling as normally expected.There are a couple of great star turns from Bill Nighy (Again) and the excellent Derek Jacobi as Alexander which certainly helps with the acting stakes, and the direction is very effective with fast moving cinematography which keeps the action pelting along. This is aided in no small measure by a bigger is better mentality which leads to plenty of large explosions and thrilling set pieces.The soundtrack is pretty good too; subtle when necessary and hard kicking when things get moving.Overall a decent movie and well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy-action movie that is fun to watch .. But don't bother with the story much ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie more than the first one. Underworld has the setting, the characters, and the story. But somewhat slow in execution, scarce in action sequences and varieties. This one uses the same setting, the same (a few more) characters and a parallel story. The movie spends no time with the introductions, just embarks into action sequences that let you no time to look away till the end. The opposite of the first one.If you haven't watched Underworld, do not bother watching U:Evolution. You have to watch the first one in order to grasp "what is going on", and "who are these people". If you don't follow this advice, the movie will look like a mindless gore-fest.For gore-fans. This is a movie you will like. There is blood pouring everywhere, body parts flying in the air. I must admit, I found the quality of CGI particularly successful in reflecting the gore to the audience.As I mentioned before, this movie is intense; full of action. The first movie did not live up to my expectations, but this one made up for it. On the other hand, some of the action is a little meaningless and illogical, although this does not distract you much. As an example, an elite team of marksmen is firing at a werewolf, the werewolf is just standing there for a great deal of time doing nothing but growl at them, but you see bullets reflecting only on the walls, on the furniture, on the ground etc. but no bullets going in or out of the werewolf. At least show some blood on the werewolf, for god's sake. Does not anyone in the FX-team notice such small details? And in one scene the vampire-lady moves really quick, jumping really high, and in other scene she acts like an ordinary school girl, fighting werewolves with futile effort.As a result, no satisfying story here, no character development, no Oscar-winning acting performance. If you want a nice epic story about vampires look somewhere else. This movie is for fun only, with lots of action and nice-looking CGI. What it does, it does good.One last remark I should make is that: After watching this movie, I just wanted to watch the first movie again, to grasp the setting and characters more, and to enjoy this one more. I think it deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viktor's Wings as the Star of the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are created for special effects carnivals: a subservient storyline serves merely as the glue to hold together 106 minutes of action. Films such as UNDERWORLD - EVOLUTION is one of this genre and if the viewers take it for that they won't be disappointed. Writer (with Danny McBride) and Director Len Wiseman pulled out all the unused parts of the original UNDERWORLD and have recycled them and magnified them into a sequel starring Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsale and he knows how to make it work.The script for the film is probably only a few pages long so the bulk of the piece is action. And here the real stars appear: Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos, Art Direction by Chris August, Set Decoration by Lin MacDonald and Costume Design by Wendy Partridge are only a few of the names that deserve the credit for the success. Everything is shot in a shade of blue (Simon Duggan is the cinematographer) but of course that is appropriate because it all takes place at night when vampires can function. The story is rather easy to condense: lycans vs vampires with a cross section of a hybrid to spice things up come into a centuries old conflict struggle for power. More than that is unnecessary to know.Kate Beckinsale is ever beautiful and is such a fine actress that she brings some warmth to this comic book heroine. But the rest of the cast is paralyzed by silly dialogue and that holds down the likes of Derek Jacobi, Scott Speedman, unintentionally hilarious bad guy Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, etc. But keep your eyes focused on the locks, the wonderful wings of Viktor with all that they can do, and the entertainingly gruesome and ultimately tiring 'turning' of men into distortions of werewolves. As for Beckinsale and Speedman, they make a nice couple, but it is more a 'blood in, blood out' romance.Not for the squeamish or those who look for story, but for what it is UNDERWORLD part II and obviously to be continued is a special effects delight.

		<fullReview>wow. this new underworld movie is so much better than the first one .you can't even begin to compare the two.evolution has way more action and stunts than the first one and it has a hell of a lot more blood and gore something the first one lacked as far as i'm concerned.kate beckinsale is back once again as the vampiress selene and she kicks ass big time.there are a lot more werewolves this time around and lots of good battles with really gory results.so go buy this DVD right away if you like seeing a hot vampire brunette killing werewolves while wearing real tight leather outfits.lets hope selene comes back to kick ass again in another sequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sequels in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I don't mean that this is should be up for Oscars or anything. What I mean is that comparing the sequel to the original this is an excellent sequel. IMO, this movie took almost every bad part of 1 out and put good stuff in. For example, in the first one I think they made vampires seem almost like sissy's. It looked as if all vampires had above humans was jumping and landing. Also, they had her almost drowning which is odd since vampires don't need to breathe. In this movie, Selene is definitely better than human. She's shown as being faster, stronger, and with better healing and no need to breathe. BIG improvement in my mind.Selene is truly shown as a bada** in this one even in the beginning of the movie. The action is intense the special effects are amazing and the plot line is good enough to keep you interested. I especially like what they did with Marcus. If your a fan of vamps and lycans then you should like this movie. If your a fan of the first Underworld then I can't imagine you not liking this movie. Overall I give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your entertained.BUT What a waste of potential !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the no brainer action film but not really a big fan of sequels, yet i was eager to watch this movie as i was really smitten by the whole Vampire Vs Werewolves concept.Sadly this movie let almost all my expectations down. I tried to remember the fact that this movie is a sequel that too of an action movie, and that i came into this movie expecting a no brainer. But this movie took almost everything about the original and threw it away.The worst and the most disturbing part about the movie was there was just one genuine conflict between vampires and werewolves and that was in the beginning of the film throughout the rest of the film we are just seeing fights between super-creatures. Every bloody character in this film is a super creature.The acting was lacklustre and cannot be classified as being good or bad. The chemistry between the lead actors was completely missing, despite the physical intimacy.The classy action scenes from the original were completely missing. The sub plots were non-existent I mean this isn't another issue of a comic book where we can have the entire issue revolve around only one concept. In fact this movie had nothing to do with werewolves it was as if their faction didn't even exist.The only likable new character was the exiled vampire.Kate Beckinsale looked lovely as usual but she lacked the attitude from the original film. I kinda liked the eye candy that the two hot vampire girls provided.The only good things about this film (cinematically) were the flawless special effects and the good artwork and the now standard but still likable perpetual state of gloom.A further discussion on these points will need days and pages so its time for a summary.This movie will probably be liked only by the people who were ultra-hardcore fans and don't mind seeing a sequel even if it more like another issue of a comic book. Also maybe those who are seeing this series for the first time or were not fans.A fan of the base concept of vampires vs werewolf will be severely disappointed.However the entertainment value of this movie is unquestionable and doesn't leave you bored for a moment(cranky maybe but bored no). It however will give you ample time to complain about how much better it could have been afterward.This movie will go down in action movie history as one of the movies with the most wasted potential, only AVP will probably have beat this film hands down.Strictly OK.But worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step up from the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this sequel to the hit techno/horror thriller "Underworld", Len Wiseman continues his unraveling of the ancient tale surrounding the long-standing blood feud between a clan of Vampires &amp; Werewolves. Kate Beckinsale &amp; Scott Speedman reprise their roles from the original as do a number of other key players. Despite a somewhat lengthy and less than fluid intro, which seems geared to bring new viewers up to speed on the story thus far, as well as a bit wanky pacing "Underworld Evoloutions" was a pleasantly surprising time at the movies, with some quite rockin' action/Fx sequences and a fitting tenancy for violence, bloodshed and gore, which was a bit lacking in it's predecessor. There were definitely moments that put a smile on my face, and I'm not referring to the cheesy love scene either which made a point to avoid showing any of Beckinsale's naught bits... To which I say, ..."awww come one, Len, it's only a bloody movie after all." Still as in the first there's plenty of obsequious rear shots of Ms. Kate in her black vinyl stretch pants strutting her stuff ever so gracefully. She's not a bad actress, really, and I'm sure she could do a lot more with her talent, given the opportunity, but then at the moment I don't think any of us are complaining;) Though I will never learn to love the CGI werewolves, interestingly and to Wiseman's credit, there is notably a good deal less CGI used in the werewolf sequences in this film than there was in the first, replaced by some much more appropriate prosthetic and animatronic effects as well as some great full body werewolf suits. Kudos to Wiseman for toning down his overall use of CGI in this film, I for one was very grateful.So if you're wondering if the franchise ends here... well let's just say the final chapter in the "underworld" is still a ways off, so fear not there's no doubt more to come, and judging by the smashing US opening box office, I'd say that's a pretty safe bet;) A fun bit of fluff this film, and in my estimation: an improvement on the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This saga has a great plot that just motivates you to watch this movie, but in this case is not enough.There's way too much blood usage, too much unnecessary blood used; i mean sure this is after all a vampire/werewolf movie but still there's way too much blood. I felt like i was watching a Quentin Tarantino movie, plus i felt that the leads didn't really add much to this chapter of the saga.But the positive thing about this movie is that the writers did their job and wrote a great story line, and the special effects crew were outstanding.7 out of 10 is my score, could have been a great movie but it was just good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what would you guys want to see in the third part if they make one? I really enjoyed the first one and even more with the second one. I hope they continue with the story. I think that since the two movies were about two different superior races the third one could be about two even better ones. (Selene and Micheal) The second movie did a really good job ending the storyline about the immortals, but I wanted Micheal to have more power. Selene was saving his butt way too much. Also although I really liked the movies sometimes I didn't feel that the two characters had enough chemistry on screen. Maybe there was too much story to tell and not enough time to tell it so it was rushed and that's why. I'll see Selene and she's fighting and I think, she could've carried the movie by herself. Same for her love interest but I'm a sucker for romance even if sometimes there were no sparks. Maybe they can make the third one with more fireworks and an even scarier bad guy. They'll have to create a third brother somehow with even scarier powers. Ohhhh I'd love to see that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampirical, sexy and good old fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 'genre' film, so please let's ignore those who either don't 'get' the genre, or think vampires need to be cloaked and have luciferian haircuts.The genre isn't known for it's complicated plots or Mills &amp; Boon romance elements, and U:E doesn't provide either; though it does provide romance--which is always a nice counterweight to the blood and gore and hoarse, overwrought vampirical (and, in this instance, werewolfish) pronouncements and somewhat stilted dialogue. Plus there always seems to be the need for lengthy exposition and explanation. Actually there shouldn't be, but this is a sequel and there may be those who didn't see the original. I don't know how that's possible, but what the heck! The crappy expositional material, though some attempt was made to wave it into the action, and the way in which the background really, really could have been less twisted and convoluted, is the reason why I didn't this any more points--despite Kate Beckinsale in latex (and out of it: very daring!), which is just about the best thing I've seen in a vampire flick since Jessica Biehl in Blade 3.So what, it's all about violence and sex? You bet. That's the essence of the genre and its antecedents.U:E delivers all of that. It wasn't 'tense' as such, because you saw the action a mile coming, but I, for one, didn't mind. I enjoyed it more than the Blade movies, possibly because of Kate Latex, but I'd like to claim it was because of the helicopter in it. And nobody would believe me. Tut, tut.Just sit back an enjoy it. It all ends of a positive note, though I'm kind of wondering just exactly WHAT these people eat and how much. They're not vegetarians, and hearty Russian peasant-food doesn't seem to cut it either. I wonder if the writer had a bad experience in Russia--with food that is. I got the impression there was an in-joke somewhere.Oh, yes, and Kate rocks and kicks serious butt. To think that she played Hero and Emma in some distant past... Oh, well, this is probably better for her anyway. Exercise is good for you. Never mind 'character' roles, which are over-rated anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION: Offers Blood-curdling fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Underworld" sequel proves to be a fang biting, head ripping-off success. "Underworld Evolution" came out on Fri. Jan. 20, 2006, to packed theaters pulling in $100 million worldwide. The "Underworld Evolution" saga begins with a flashback to the medieval era when the Vampires true purpose is to hunt down and kill any and all Lycans (hence the name "Death Dealers"). Two families tie this movie together, Selene's family, before she became a Death Dealer, and the Corvinus family. Alexander Corvinus, never shows which sides he's on (Vampire or Werewolf), who plays a superior being to his sons. When Alexander's sons were still young, Marcus (Tony Curran) is bitten by a Vampire, his brother Jacobi (Derek Jacobi) is bitten by a Werewolf, and another brother, who is never shown in the movie, stayed as a mortal. Though, Marcus considers Alexander cruel to leave Jacobi locked away in a tomb and Marcus kills him, in order to get the key to open Jacobi's tomb. Long ago, Selene's family was slaughtered by the Vampires because her family knew the secrets of the locked coffin which her father built to entomb Jacobi. Since Marcus and Jacobi are brothers they never attack one another. Marcus's Vampire army, however, captures Jacobi while Viktor decides to lock Jacobi away forever. The movie continues with Marcus' reawakening. He has learned Selene has killed Viktor and Kraven (Shane Brolly), who is in charge of the Vampire clan before the awakening of any elder Vampires, betrayed the Vampire clan by giving its secrets away to the Lycans. Marcus finds Selene and Michael at Alexander's secret base. After killing everyone but Selene, Marcus flees and Selene drinks the blood of Alexander who tells her, in his dying words, she will become the future. Selene and a crew of Death Dealers go to the island where Jacobi's imprisoning coffin is. From there, Marcus reaches the island before her and releases Jacobi from his prison. So, Selene is pitted against a full-fledged Werewolf and Vampire, though luckily, Michael comes back to life. The Hybrid, Michael, makes a swinging entrance as he battles one-on-one with the Werewolf and triumphs by ripping his head off. At the end of "Underworld" the lies Viktor spreads about the war between the Death Dealers (Vampires) and Lycans (Werewolves) was revealed. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) killed the Elder vampire Viktor (Bill Nighy) leaving her an outcast with her forbidden lover, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a Hybrid (half Werewolf and half Vampire, though disappointingly looks a lot like NightCrawler from "X-Men"). Unfortunately, this movie is extremely gory, which accounts for its R rating. "Underworld Evolution" is directed by Len Wiseman, whose only experience with directing movies is the "Underworld" saga. He presents "Underworld Evolution" as a must see movie of the year. The Gothic-ally eerie music plays a role in setting the tone of this movie, though it does not prepare anyone for the Werewolves, Vampires or blood splatter that jump out from the screen. "Underworld Evolution's" graphics are a mix between the "The Matrix" and "Van Helsing" though the plot/story line is nowhere near similar to either. This movie doesn't quite put a face on who is good and who is evil, because both sides have good intentions. Selene becomes a more powerful Vampire and Michael's abilities are just as superior. Now that the elder Vampires and Lycan king are dead, the pair is faced with an uncertain future together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampires Vs. Lycans Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Underworld: Evolution" is Len Wiseman's follow-up to his first installment, which chronicled a secret battle between vampires and werewolves (a.k.a. lycans). The sequel picks up where the original left off. Markus, the original vampire, has just been woken, and is out to wreak havoc. We also get to see how the vampire/lycan war began, with the schism between the Corvinus brothers: Markus and William, the original lycan. The sequel is loaded with blood and gore, proving to be even bloodier than the original "Underworld." The visual effects are eye-catching. Particularly with Viktor, with the appearance of a creepy half human-half bat. The story seems a bit far-fetched at times. But the end does leave the story open for a third installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(slight Underworld 1 spoilers) I'm a big fan of the first Underworld (and of Kate Beckinsale, mmmm) and I loved the mix of stylistic action with a dark Gothic, yet modern setting. While I thought it lacked a certain element to make it an excellent movie, I really thought the story was well done. The characters were interesting, each had their motives, and it was chock full of drama, violence and betrayal- great stuff. The story also leaves off in such a way that it leaves plenty more to tell.You've got Kraven on the loose, Lucien dead and betrayed, Victor and Amelia assassinated. You've got Marcus about to awaken and Selene and Michael on the run. I couldn't wait to see what happened to these characters and how the story would tie together!!! In this sense I think the movie failed. Instead of building off the awesome story they had going in the first one, they just sort of used it as a background for a totally new story. I was really expecting more interesting characters and story arcs to follow, but they weren't there.On the other hand the action was awesome, and the movie's filled with luscious gore. Also there's a super hot sex scene with my favorite actress in it!!!While 'Evolution' meets all the criteria to be a good Hollywood blockbuster it doesn't do enough to reward it's fans for the long wait. On the other hand, if you want fun entertainment for two hours, Underworld 2 probably won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because I had heard that the first one had been good. I really had no idea what to expect because I didn't even know that the movie was about the wars between the Liken and the vampires.Without having seen the first one this movie was still an excellent show. There was a relatively good story-line and the fight scenes (although gory) were quite impressive. The movie was shot during the night(you know: vampires can't be in the sun) which also gave a neat feel to the movie because there was very little color and gave it an almost Sin City feel. And it was just a bonus that the lead female role was hot.All in all it was a great movie and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the action/fantasy genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire Selene(Kate Beckinsale)&amp; Lycan Michael(Scott Speedman)have a new nemesis to contend with in this installment, newly released(..from his entombment)Marcus Corvinus(Tony Curran), the supremely powerful son of the forefather of both vampires and lycans, Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus wishes to release his uncontrollable werewolf brother(who is simply a raging, breeding monster who can not return to human form with those he bites cursed with the same affliction)from a specific crypt only known by the dead Viktor and Selene. Selene's childhood is touched on more in this sequel as we learn that her father was the one who created and built the very tomb holding the werewolf..Marcus wishes to find out that place through Selene's blood which is why he attempts to catch her. Selene will seek out the very forefather of all mutations, Alexander to seek the truth on why he'd allow such devastation between both factions, vampires and lycans alike, to continue. Meanwhile, we also learn the reasons behind why Marcus would wish to release such a beast upon the world and why he wishes for father Alexander to remain out the picture permanently. Alexander, seeing that no hope for civilization exists as long as Marcus is alive(..he wishes to rule the human race as a god), will allow Selene to drink from his royal blood which will lead to the eventual climactic battle in a castle ruins where the werewolf is entombed.I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed this sequel..it's a merging of both the Gothic and the modern. Set in a sleepy, cold setting where little sunshine is ever seen, we witness endlessly entertaining duels between Marcus(..whose vampire resembles a demon with wings)and his foes, Selene &amp; Michael..including one harrowing sequence where Marcus, in winged demon form flying after them as they drive a truck around treacherous curves on a mountain-side. Lots of graphic violence including flesh often being torn and bodies often being pierced. Marcus often uses the tip of his wings to drive through the shoulders and hands of those he questions. Poor lycan/vampire/human hybrid Michael gets stabbed through(..and thrown in the air and against objects)A LOT. Erotic sex scene between Selene and Michael which shows us their blossoming love for one another. And, last but not least, Kate in tight leather certainly never grows old. I thought the flick had marvelous special effects, including some cool werewolf transformation sequences(..and one doozy of a helicopter crash at the end where the propeller is used as a weapon to great effect).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very nice nonsense about vampires and werewolves. The screenplay author's got a rich, although sick fantasy indeed. What I like in this movie comparing to the first "Underworld" is a number of beautiful fight-scenes: a winter forest, a village, an abandoned castle, a battleship etc. Besides, there are even some funny sexual episodes and werewolves are very cute.Sure, the story itself is absolutely senseless, but who cares? On second thought, "The Godfather" and "The Lord of the Rings" are very far from reality as well, aren't they? "Underworld" does not pretend to be any kind of realistic, does not contain any morale or pathos, so your attention is concentrated on adventures and fighting and it's really fascinating.No doubt, my total mark is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Underworld story continues with Kate Beckinsale as Selene continuing her battle with werewolves in this sequel. The film is action-packed with good special effects and a somewhat good storyline, but there is a few problems. One problem is that if it has been awhile since you saw the original, than you might not remember the storyline as well. I saw this film twice in the theater and with the first time I was not quite sure of where this film was starting. I then rented the first film, than watched Evolution again and the plot made much more sense. Kate Beckinsale is a tough ass-kicking beauty in this movie which is most likely to attract the teen guy crowd. Horror fans as well as action fans who liked the original will probably enjoy this sequel. I won't be surprised if we see Underworld 3 coming out in the near-future.</fullReview>

The first 5 minutes was riveting and action packed! The first one brought the two together and the sequel completed their love and devotion for each other with a very blissful event of love making. But the extreme fight scenes were awesome, it had the audience screaming for more and applauding the graphic realism with each brutal kill!!! I loved the ending fight, did wish it went a little longer, but was great all the same. Looks to be a 3rd one coming out, I see less of a turnout.

		<shortDescription>gr8 movie!...I request everyone to read this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well.... i've read virtually every comment on the movie and now its my turn.....first part of my review has no spoilers and second part has many,but i've specified it well...(THIS PART HAS NO SPOILERS,for those who haven't seen it) 1)It starts of from where it left off.It has more pace,this one does.... but that doesn't affect the movie adversely in any way.2)Action is much more convincing here,both in case of Selene and Michael.Selene's acting is much better than in the first.Special effects too were pretty good in my opinion.3)Character development although some people said was very less...i say it's as much as in the first.Only 3 new characters have been introduced and enough done to make us understand who they are.4)The love scene no secret by now,....was well done.Some say timing was bad,but i don't say so.It's believable,emotional people will be able to relate more to the sway of emotions.It only took 2 mins probably..so i don't know why people are making it a big issue.It was pretty OK.5)Michael's progress throughout the movie in realising his powers has been decently portrayed.Markus plays a different type of villain than the ones we saw in the first part,but only because his character is supposed to be such.6)Flashbacks mind you are not irritating at all,as they are not as lengthy and unnecessary as some people have said,...unless of course you have seen the original 3-5 times the previous day.7)The concept is maintained,rules of dying are not broken like some people suggested.You have to be attentive...thats all! 8)Plot is more predictable than the first but not too much also.....so if you crave twists and turns badly,i guess you shouldn't see this! 9)I didn't feel things were copied as much as people suggested..... some things are bound tocoincide once a lot of action movies have been made.The concept is very original,like the first one.It builds on that.10)Some people said the plot was contradictory,....it was in a few ways as to what started the war....but i know the difference and cant disclose here without it being a spoiler.Yes depiction of that part wasn't too gr8.My suggestion is given below regarding this! All in all a gr8 movie which one should see,if u like the vamp ,werewolf stuff and action and concepts based on a historical background.Not for kids!(THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT clarification(MAY HAVE SPOILERS)......) 1)They haven't specifically mentioned they are using u.v. bullets or silver ones,considering we understood from the first movie.In places where it's needee it's mentioned.2)The war was started as shown in the beginning of the second movie...the war the vamps won and took the werewolves for slaves.In the first one ,what they show is why the werewolves revolt against the kind of discrimination the vamps showed towards them,specially their influential leader,Lucian.Listen carefully ,you will know.3)Kate's face gets burnt as well...i remember saying it doesn't.you need glasses.4)Alexander Corvinus is easy to kill,as he doesn't want to kill his son,not because he can't.Emotional people will be able to relate more to this.5)Marcus wants to free his brother,because after all ...he is a brother,in spite of what he is?How can one question blood relations?6)In the end sunlight doesn't affect Kate as she too becomes something of a hybrid after taking in the Corvinus blood.7)The hybrids are different as one was a werewolf first so,it becomes something which looks more wolfy,and Marcus was a vamp first,so his persona later resembles more like a bat.Kate stays the same because....come on you wouldn't want to see her with a messed up face and hair all over.8)It wasn't that vamps couldn't become hybrids or werewolves couldn't become vamps by taking in the Corvinus blood.Only reason they didn't in the first part because why would one race want to mix with another race they hate...so they looked for a human corvinus...since Alexander was too strong.In the second part,Markus already was a Corvinus.And took in the lycan blood by accident.And Kate takes in that from a human immortal,Corvinus again....Probably thats why she still looks human. Drinking Corvinus blood is the key to becoming a hybrid.9)Immortals don't mean normal bullets cant hurt one or sword can't pierce you.Its just that they are less effective.Using u.v. and silver bullets are most effective.That is what they have tried to show, judging from both movies.They mean immortal in the sense one won't die of natural causes.Thats it!Hope all your doubts have vanished!</fullReview>

But, when you add the hotness factor, you've got a race, neck vs. bite-able neck.As always I notice flaws in plausibility that could have been removed by more skillful craft.1) When the Selene slams Marcus against the cliff wall with the truck, the front wheels break, as expected on such a crazy stunt. A quicker edit to the next shot would have been smart.2) Marcus shouldn't be able to pull the helicopter out of the sky. A vampire may be strong enough for this, but certainly not heavy enough. A simple shot of him bracing his feet upwards against the castle stones would have been enough to make this believable.</fullReview>

The acting was really good and the characters are really believable so you get pulled into the plot pretty easily.

		<shortDescription>Good for A Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution picks up where the previous movie left off. For viewers that have not seen the first movie, please view it before watching this sequel. Without the background of the first movie, the plot of this sequel will just end up confusing the viewer. Evolution does a very good job of explaining and answering a lot of the questions that came up after the last movie and further expands the movie watcher's knowledge of the Underworld Universe. Kate Beckingsale's Selene looks as good as ever and is definitely the main draw for the movie. The character of Michael, played by Scott Speedman, however was under utilized. I think a lot more could have been done for Michael, but throughout the movie he just seems to tag along. Plus his acting was weak. Marcus and William are a good pair of characters and prove to be great villains. The actions sequences are on par with the first movie, although there is not as memorable as the one in the first movie in which Selene shoots through the floor in order to escape. If you enjoyed the first movie, then you'll like this movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate Beckinsale steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delicious Kate Beckinsale is back in her skin tight leathers as Selene the vampire, dealing death to her fellow neck suckers and other creatures of the night, in the spectacular sequel to 2003's Underworld.Picking up the story almost from the moment the first film finishes, Underworld: Evolution is basically a plot-lite monster chase movie interspersed with effects-heavy fight sequences that eventually degenerate into a kind of supernatural James Bond with OTT set pieces and wacky gadgets.Of particular note, along with the climactic punch-up (complete with helicopter crashing through the ceiling), is the opening scene, set in the 13th Century, of vampire knights tracking down the first werewolf (William) and fighting off a village of his recent converts. Throughout the movie great atmospheric use is made of the story's Eastern Euopean setting (as in the original and Blade 2), resisting the easy option of relocating it to the United States.Several of the characters from the first film make cameos of varying lengths, and the action is certainly ramped up a gear - not so much walking in slow motion and Goth vampires with attitude.While Kate holds her own in the acting stakes and Steven Mackintosh enjoys his role as a lustful vampire exile, Derek Jacobi phones in his performance as the enigmatic Corvinus (presumably he was doing this as a favour or just wanted some pocket money). Scott Speedman mopes his way through his part as the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael, but it's slinky Selene and the action set-pieces that will stick in the memory.Looking back I can't believe how much I disliked the original when I saw it at the cinema - sure it's more World of Darkness than Buffy The Vampire Slayer - but it's just a load of harmless nonsense and, having re-evaluated it in light of a cheap DVD purchase, I've decided it's actually very entertaining for what it is.Underworld: Evolution doesn't need any such re-evaluation. Sure it's trash, but superb trash. Although the main characters seem to get more powerful at the end of each film, I still believe the Underworld saga deserves a few more chapters ... and how about a Blade/Underworld crossover? Now that would kick ass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous effects and scenery, hazy plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking into see this movie in the theater I wasn't expecting much. Standard schlock violence: something to numb the brain on. I found myself paying less attention to the movie its self as it played out though and more on the gorgeous sets and the incredible attention to detail on the special effects.To me it seemed as if the movies should have been chopped in half with the first half sewn onto the last part of the first movie and the second half filled in where all the missing bits of info and scene were that would help the viewer understand how everything is so close together and convenient in Prague. Maybe character build and explore the awkward budding relationship between the two main characters. Or explore a bit more of the seemingly wicked cool vampires at the beginning of the second movie who you didn't really get to see that much of who they were or why they were there in the first movie. But now you get the recaps that should have been in the first movie and- confused yet? You will be.The entire plot runs on that 'spur of the moment- it seemed like a good idea at the time' kind of pacing. I'm not sure why some of the action sequences happened the way that they did. It almost dipped into the B-grade variety of convenient mishaps and 'ooo I forgot about that' to keep the fight scenes alive. And the pivotal grand battle at the end that everyone waited to see was anticlimactic at best: far too quick and far too telegraphed.If you haven't watched Underworld One very close to watching the second one and don't have an eidetic memory you're going to sit stymied through the first twenty minutes of film. It was gorgeously done. The acting was completely in line from movie to movie. But it was confusing and choppy at parts. And I really wanted to see more of Amelia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an amazing movie. I loved the slight twists, and I loved the ending. standing in the light even through all the darkness. I thought that he was going to die and she was going to end up pregnant, but neither happened. I also really loved the sex scene between Michael and Seline. It was tasteful, which isn't often found in movies. For those of you who haven't seen the movie it's really graphic without showing anything...kinda cool. I also like how both of the films combined take place over like 4 days. It bothered me how none of the people went to sleep though. This is an absolute must-see. I loved it just as much as the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prerequisite: Underworld (viewed recently)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 5/10.The first Underworld was very enjoyable. The fighting scenes were somewhat new at the time (everyone remembers the scene where Selene uses her guns to perforate the wood floor she's standing on to make an exit for herself). But, this sequel was extremely disappointing. It starts off immediately where the original ended, but reviews the original in a very confusing way. I watched the original about a year ago, and I was somewhat lost even 30 minutes into the sequel. Because of that, I had the very unenjoyable sense that I didn't know what was going on when I should have known what was going on.The acting wasn't quite cheesy and the storyline was somewhat forced. There was also an unexpectedly explicit sex scene in the middle that I thought was not appropriate for the type of movie that it was. I'm sure a lot of under aged kids will be watching this movie, and really was shocked by how explicit the scene was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair movie, but not excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gives a lot of back-story to the original "Underworld", and was a rather exciting action movie. However, I feel the director was a little too "free" with some of the more explicitly sexual scenes. At some point, I began to feel that he was drawing them out just to fill movie time.This is a spoiler alert. I'm kind of upset about the end of the movie as well. Bringing the hybrid back to life was a mistake, in my opinion. It took away the passion that our heroine had for avenging him. Following his resurrection he saves her life, which leads me to believe that the only reason he was brought back to life was for lack ability to find another way to give the movie-goers their happy ending.Otherwise, its your typical action/fight/gore movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great promise, shaky follow-through, IMO.First, yeah, I know, 'horror' movies are loaded with gore- but you need to balance that out with character development (especially with new characters in a sequel!) and plot-line expansion... or you get a choppy, abrupt, in your face series of violent scenes with only marginal reasoning given for much of it.Second, I got the strong feeling there WAS more 'conversations' or non-violent scenes filmed, or at least scripted, and that missing footage would go a long way towards clarifying some of the discrepancies many reviewers have brought up here.Third, I agree there might just be some divergence between the original and Evolution in history, reasoning, motivations, etc. There was some critical information not given in the first, like how many covens and where, etc, that lead to assumptions that then feel like this movie contradicts the first...again, I suspect that back-story exists and the details line up better than first viewing implies. Still, I cannot ignore certain details caught: I would swear, for example, that the original memory shots from Selene's character showed a MUCH more recent history than the early 13th century- or even the 16th! I would say French pre-Revolution country estate family likely. Yet, in this sequel it is clear her family is from an isolated and mountainous rural area, crafting guild economic level, and the details in clothing and tools, etc, lead one to perceive it is indeed no more recent than late Midiaeval times...The following series of events only raise more questions: There is the reference in the first movie to a 'virus' sweeping through and killing all but Alexander Corvinous in his 'village'- and stated to be more than 800 years earlier in the first movie in 2003; the implication is there that this is 'the Plague' as in bubonic which is spread by infected fleas, but the first sign of this in Eastern Europe was in seaports from ships arriving from the East and via the Silk Road trade routes...in 1347-8! And here in the mountain fastness of Hungary it strikes over 150 years sooner?Then, at some later date two of Alexander's sons (clearly born after the virus since everyone else died previously, and they appear to be in their early 30's in the movie) are bitten and converted...and what about the 3rd son, that remained human and Michael is decended from- no mention anywhere in this sequel, and it would have made sense to discuss that in some way... Then there is the scene of Markus approaching Viktor the human powerful warlord late in life and converting him to a vampire... And then Viktor has a young adult vampire daughter he kills for loving and conceiving with a Lycan slave (premise of first movie)- And clearly this early scene is MUCH later than the first scene in this sequel which is set in 1202, since they have their historian telling us that it took many generations before those converted to Lycanism were able to return to human form at all, let alone become cowering slaves to vampires!So...OK, the first date is a bit liquid, the second, uncertain, the third tentative, and the fourth is post-1202 by some significant distance. Assuming the tightest possible spacing, the initial 'virus' is transmitted via Alexander Corvinous to his newborn sons 30-35 years before Viktor is converted, he rapidly takes charge and William is caught in 1202 and his prison is constructed a some point reasonably soon after (within 10 years given building timelines), and Victor's daughter is killed at least 100 years after that, to allow generational Lycan evolution a realistic chance.So, how did Selene have no clue about what happened with Viktor's daughter and Lucian since she now appears to have been converted before this happened and it was clearly a pretty tight community? And why was she not on-scene, again, as a death-dealer in the crucial fight with the Lycans where all but Kraven are killed and he takes credit for killing Lucian-since the woodprints in the original movie shows the very castle the second movie ends at, where she spent her early years?! Some clarification of the timeline is crucial, or this all starts falling apart from movie to movie :(1 hr 46 mins, including the previews AND closing credits best I could tell, is far too short a movie. My best hope is that they will release the Director's Cut DVD with at LEAST 30 mins of footage to fill in the logic gaps and build the characters and motivations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new breed of the vampire genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman are back for the sequel to one of the best vampire movies. Its carries on right from where the last one left off. And they now fight the strongest immortal, Marcus. He wants to rule along side his brother William, who was condemned by Viktor centuries ago. He wishes bring the world to chaos but Marcus must now fight Selene, and Michael. Now hybrids, and now as strong as Marcus.Its a combination of romance/action/adventure/horror. Underworld: Evolution is realistic world of vampires and lycans. Maybe the critics don't like it because it doesn't involve two gay cowboys or a out done story about horrible country singers? Maybe they just don't have good taste and need for a thrill.The first one was amazing, this one is to. Can't help it if the critics don't know how to have a little fun in the theater. Isn't that what going to the movies are about? You don't have to go see a acclaimed film just because everyone else has. This movie is worth a vampire fans time and money.It has blood and gore and an actual storyline. Which is entertaining and suspenseful. The CGI was astounding, especially for a low-budget movie. I loved every second. I'm definitely seeing it again. Its a must see for vampire fans or someone just wanting to have a good time at the movies. The fact that the story could be real, but is ,at the same time, so out there makes it appealing to any crowd. I saw ages from 7-60. The love scenes aren't vulgar, and they are portrayed artistically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked about the first part was the way it was shot like a very good nu-metal video, but with hot vampires and werewolves in it. The CGI was great and classy, and the black-and-blue look gave the movie a great atmosphere. Compared to the original, I find the sequel very disappointing, in that in place of the atmosphere we get gore (and some bold sex scenes - woof!). The story is just too simple, even for a vampire movie - it's like a Buffy episode rolled out into a full-length film. Another bad thing is what they chose for the setting; in place of the looming Gotham of the first part (which I think worked very well with the idea of the modern vampire / werewolf the movie used), we get the Romanian outdoors, with guns. The plot is chaotic and too episodic, and there are fewer breathtaking special effects - even the supposedly more primeval werewolves pale in comparison with the raging fight club of The Underworld one. So as a fan of the first part, I found the sequel to have only a fraction of the "coolness factor" of the original. The movie could have taken what the first part offered way farther, but instead, we got what could be seen as somewhat uninspired material for a future video-game adaptation. I say wait till it's out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld: Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched Underworld(1) a few times and I like the storyline and characters in it so when I saw the trailer to Underworld: Evolution and I thought it looked worth watching; after all I liked the first one (boy was I wrong) This (Underworld: Evolution)movie is another sequel that should have not been made. From predictable plot line to not engaging the watchers with any emotion. yes it is bloody and violent but that does not make a good film. The fight sequences are boringly predictable with unlimited ammo, Kate only tops up on ammo just to make a point not because she needs to.Kate Beckinsale acting goes from bad to worse with this endeavour.Michael Corvin character does nothing different from the first movie. what a waste! expanding on that characters story line could have saved this movie but NO we had to have Kate looking pretty killing bad guys without a plot and totally ruining the movie.When will film makers understand that making a sequel means that you should improve on the first one. Not plonk any old tat on the screen and label it as a sequel.e.g. Blade the first movie was great, a vampire story which was very different from what had came before. Blade 2 just as good as the first, Blade 3 Trinity what a pile of steaming horse p** rushed out just to make a bit of money from the success of the second one. Looks like the makers of Underworld: Evolution had the same idea.I and my friends were very relived to leave the cinema after watching Underworld: Evolution, although we would have felt a lot better if we had not just wasted our money paying to watch it.I recommend that you avoid this movie like the plague, save your money spend it on something else rent a DVD, put it in a bank just don't waste it on this!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen and loved Underworld and was so excited about the sequel. I had seen previews, posters, and couldn't wait to see what would happen to Selene, now that she was against the other vampires. However I really was disappointed.The first movie had intrigue and deception, cool fight scenes, and neat weapons that they were all coming up with to defeat the other side. In Underworld:Evolution, they took out all of the intrigue and deception, neat weapons... but they did keep the fight scenes. However they weren't as cool as they could have been. It was just total blood and gore. In the first movie it was new and improved fighting compared to old time vampire and werewolf hunting. This movie did not really keep up with that idea. The fight scenes and even the final battle really weren't anything special. They were pretty redundant.The first movie had a plot. Evolution had pretty much none. All it was, was huge, bloody fight scenes and one huge sex scene thrown in. There really hadn't been much screen time in the first movie showing the romantic story between Michael and Selene, which I was fine with. However it seemed that they were trying to make up for lost time in this one and threw this very unnecessary and rude scene in.At the end of Underworld the first movie, you were left with this anticipation for what Michael could do, now that he was a hybrid. You kind of expected to see more of what he could do now with it besides just fight. Well he can't do much more than what he did in the first movie. You expect to see new and cooler powers given to other people in the film, but are totally let down by the end of the movie.It was a real let down because of how well the first Underworld had done. It shows that blood and gore and sex are the only things that will make a movie "good" these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodsuckers v/s Werewolves... It doesn't get any better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the dawn of movie-making, monster movies have captivated the big screen and have been reproduced endlessly due to their ever-growing popularity. Every year, a new monster movie is released and it outdoes the previous one in some way. This series of evolution has led to this year's monster movie masterpiece.Kate Beckingsale returns with her co-star Scott Speedman in this tantalizing sequel to the 2003 blockbuster "Underworld". Beckingsale is a warrior Vampire battling the vicious Werewolf clan in an endless war between Vampires and Werewolves. This time, the father of the bloodsuckers, Marcus, has returned to free his brother William, the father of the Werewolves, from his impregnable prison. William, once a human like his brother, had been transformed into a Werewolf and had been spreading the dreaded Werewolf curse repeatedly. Marcus, wishing control of his own army, allies himself with a king, Viktor, whom he offers immortality by transforming him into a vampire. Viktor, who learns that the death of either of the brothers Marcus and William would mean the total extinction of both of their races respectively, decides to protect them from harm. He imprisons William in an isolated fortress and keeps Marcus as a high ranking officer in his army. Hundreds of years later, Viktor is killed by Seline (Kate Beckingsale) after killing her father who built William's prison. Viktor had feared that William would be released and would not have him killed since his death would also mean the death of Viktor's useful slave servants, the Lyken, who are evolved Werewolves capable of taking human form. Marcus is awakened and seeks for William to free him and create a new species becoming a God. Seline learns of his plans and decides that, with the help of Michael the hybrid, she must destroy Marcus before reaching William.Astounding special effects and impressive performances from the cast highlight a great story and outdo the prequel.In my opinion, the best monster movie by far. It even surpasses "Van Helsing", Beckingsale's other major monster movie role, and promises an even more impressive sequel.If the special effects and story just don't do it for you, maybe mentioning stomach-turning violence and partial nudity would give you the extra boost needed to go watch it.Fantastic movie. Well worth the admission and then some. I highly recommend you go watch it.My Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution, the sequel by Len Wiseman, is nowhere as good as the original Underworld. Given the fact that the filmmakers had 3 years to come up with a wholly inspired script, I was quite shocked and appalled that the story was anemic. It's sad because Kate Beckinsale as the main character Selene, whose performance I thoroughly enjoyed in the first film, is given an uninspired role for this film. The pacing itself was also off, partly to blame on the slow-moving storyline, but also to the use of stilted cinematography and sluggish editing. The music also is very inappropriate in my opinion and sometimes annoying. All in all, after seeing the first Underworld, there was so much potential - I loved the cinematography and costume design (especially on Selene) - but this potential was deflated with this sequel. So, I'm not sure if they are going to make a part 3, but after watching this film, I'll have my reservations first before seeing it. An uninspired mess - 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first one. It was like Blade, without the cool fight scenes. It will never cease to amaze me that in a global world where fans of action can import the best of Hong Kong and Thailand (with Tony Jaa's new Muay Thai movies), American filmmakers with budgets that would choke a giraffe can't seem to hire anyone who actually KNOWS A MARTIAL ART to do his stunt choreography. How is that? My working theory is that martial arts makes Americans feel guilty, because it's a superpower anyone CAN learn, therefore the fact that we don't is our own personal moral failing, and that makes us feel like the losers we are. So instead we watch monster movies were a single bite from a vampire, werewolf, or radioactive spider grants us magical strength that makes 10 years of hard training obsolete. But you know what those bites don't make? A good movie.ACTION) - There are some fights here, but they're all clearly choreographed by people who either don't know martial arts of any kind or were purposely trying to make scenes with characters who weren't supposed to know martial arts. You'd think that immortal beings would pick up a kick or two over the years (heck, in Highlander they all devoted time to studying swordfighting from all over the world), but no. It's slash with their claw-hands, bite, and push. Boring.The best part of this movie is that the actress is hot. If you think that's a compliment, then this is the internet, and there's a wild world of porn you should think about looking at.COMEDY) - Not a comedy.PLOT) - Please. There's nothing here.It's not that Underworld 2 is worse than the first one, it's that the first one was bad enough, and today's standards for action movies have gone way, way up. I can tolerate stupid dialogue and bad plot when they build up to a knockdown fight scene, but watching people who can't throw a real punch play around with collapsing styrofoam walls and power-simulating harnesses is just disgusting.</fullReview>

The script was not only poor, but insulting (flashbacks remind us of events we saw just a little while earlier in the film), the VFX cheesy (Selene actually flies around a tree at one point), continuity is forgotten, and all characterization is lost, with the result being a mediocre follow-up intended to do nothing more than capitalize on the success of the first movie. Director Len Wiseman tried to set up for a third film the same way he set up for the second, with a voice-over from Selene, but "An unknown chapter lies ahead..." just doesn't have the same effect as Selene's original monologue. Evolution disregards everything that made the original Underworld good, and in doing so becomes not only a disappointing sequel, but an altogether disappointing movie.</fullReview>

The problem for me is that I never finished the first film. I walked out of it in the theater and I've shut it off several times on cable and DVD. The upshot of this is that I had no idea who or what was going on. I can understand how fans of the first film can love this more. Regrettably if you didn't like or see the earlier film this movie is going to be lost on you.Still if you liked the first film or want to see some great looking action sequences see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to Deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution reminded me of The Matrix Reloaded: a movie filled to its brim with a watered-down plot that undermines the success of the first movie. Underworld: Evolution seems to be caught in a paradox: on one hand, it tries to tell a story that is, in many ways, independent of its prequel, but on the other hand, it needs the premise of its prequel to survive. Ultimately, it fails as a sequel, for it fails to continue the story that was previously told. Prime example: why was Selene's family murdered, again? Beckinsale delivers a mediocre performance as Selene, a female vampire/trained killer. I felt that the character of Selene stagnates at the end of the first installment and her reason to exist in the second installment is cloaked in a very weak premise of "saving the world," or should I say "saving the underworld." All in all, Underworld: Evolution does not advance from its prequel in any way. The visuals remain the strongpoint, though no better than in the first movie, while the plot, dialog, and character development regress. If you are looking for a continuation of the first movie, Underworld: Evolution will disappoint you. If you are fan of The Matrix-type style of action movies, regardless of plot line, Evolution is worth a look (though I would recommend waiting for the DVD, you'll only squander $5.00 instead of $10.00).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Evolves," ever so slightly, beyond some expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I didn't exactly walk into this film expecting a Best Picture-winner (and it would be a shame if anyone else actually does), "Underworld: Evolution" does offer more insight and back-story into the dark depths of the underworld universe and the vicious blood feud between death-dealing vampires and lycans (werewolves). It's from these that arise some of the best improvements of the sequel over the original, as well as some of its most troubling questions.A lot of people were taken off guard by the success of the first "Underworld" in 2003 and the film has since been embraced by the Goth community, horror movie buffs, and a few above average film-goers as a semi-cult classic. So you can expect that the stakes would be high this second time out. Sequels are tricky: there's a lot riding on them and sequel history shows us that not too many are able to reach beyond their predecessor.Two of the primary actors from the first "Underworld" return - Kate Beckinsale as sexy-as-hell, black-leather-clad Selene and Scott Speedman as human-turned-werewolf-turned-vampire-turned-hybrid Michael - and "Evolution" is set directly after the events of the first film. Selene and Michael are on the run from treacherous Kraven (Shane Brolly), his goons and members of their coven, and have retreated to the relative sanctuary of a forest safe house. More on that later.For now, Kraven seeks to gain absolute power by eliminating only-remaining vampire elder Marcus (Tony Curran), who was originally thought by him to have still been in hibernation but is already reawakened and slaughters him and his henchmen. With elder Viktor (Bill Nighy) and werewolf clan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) both gone, Marcus seeks to retrieve two ancient keys so that he can awaken his murderous full-blooded lycan twin brother William (stuntman Bill Steele) from a centuries-old slumber.Selene and Michael, meanwhile, seek to prevent this from happening, and are drawn closer together as they begin to consummate their relationship, alliances change, violence continues, and they both learn the dark secrets of their separate but equally important pasts. With the reluctant aid of an exiled vampire named Tanis (Steven Mackintosh) and the mysterious Alexander (Derek Jacobi), they're in a race against time to stop the rapidly evolving Marcus from unleashing his imprisoned brother.On a technical level, it's aesthetically brilliant and pleasing to the eyes with more ominous set design, and it is easy to appreciate director Len Wiseman and screenwriter Danny McBride's "Underworld" films. The cinematography allows to you to dive into a universe quite unlike our own and is one of the most distinctive places ever captured on film. But it's also easy to take notice that not a whole lot of more interesting stuff happens there.True the film flows better than the original and that's why I give it a 9, plus the lush visuals. Only problem is, "Underworld" mythology seems to get hurt in the process. That's the huge problem with self-contained mythology: things can sometimes get lost in the confusion. We get to learn a lot in "Underworld: Evolution," but there's a lot of puzzles and not really enough genuine deception and intrigue to satisfy those outside the core fan base. I will admit, however, that I am a little sketchy when it comes to the details linking the two films together, so I will not waste time with any grievances over continuity.On the plus side, it's nice to see primaries Beckinsale and Speedman back in form, and even a little romance develops between the two (even though director Wiseman thought to leave that out of the first movie, and the camera just barely misses some explicit nudity during his wife's love scene with her co-star). Both handle themselves better this time out, and the blood + gore that culminates as a result of their actions is much more plentiful.All in all, "Underworld: Evolution" evolves beyond its predecessor, though I'm not confident enough to recommend it, or the original "Underworld," to anyone else who may not be a fan of this sort of movie. I liked the original "Underworld" and as this film's ending may hint, a third trip into this universe is just off the horizon. Selene's narration, like the rolling tides of the ocean and glorious sunshine that make up the film's closing shots, indicate that the third time out may be the last. Of course, this is only an assumption.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "Underworld" was visually spectacular but suffered from a confusing storyline and obnoxiously relentless sound effects and music. It was dizzying. However, I enjoyed it enough to smack it with my "tweener" grade of C+.By all accounts, this sequel should have been a dismal failure. Why? Well, first of all, it is a sequel. By reputation, sequels are typically worse than their prequels. Secondly, this is an action-fantasy that relies heavily on special effects. That's usually not a genre where you find consistent quality. And last, but not least, the original was merely okay... Somewhat entertaining but nothing particularly memorable outside of Kate Beckinsale splendiferously filling leather outfits like no other actress can. I can honestly say that I didn't expect to give "U:E" anything higher than a C or C-.So, I found it quite a pleasant surprise to walk out of this theatre experience completely satisfied. I had fun. I saw Katie Becksie and her outfits. I got a reasonably coherent plot that emotionally involved me enough to care about the outcome. The effects were quite cool to behold. The ice-blue lighting and cinematography as a whole was quite breathtaking. There was a love story that began to blossom. And the ending, while also setting up a third in what will assuredly become a series, felt complete.I still find it amazing that the delicate, corset-wearing English rose, Kate Beckinsale as Selene, can kick as much Lycan ass as she does in these films. Before the original, I had the distinct feeling that she was going to seem out of place. She doesn't. She owns this film and this series, firing weaponry like it was second nature and fighting like she could teach Bruce Lee a thing or two. Fine... We all know that there are some incredible effects helping her out and that her stunt doubles are stepping in to do the hard bits. But she pulls off this type of role far better than the more appropriately equipped Angelina Jolie in the disappointing "Tomb Raider" series. She puts Milla Jovovich's character in "Resident Evil" to shame. And she even holds her own with the classic female action hero, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the "Alien" series. The tie-breaker... Beckinsale is hotter.This film's plot is, yet again, pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Vampires hunt Lycans. Lycans eat Vampires. Vampires and Lycans create a hybrid. An ancient tale of brothers divided between the species is the engine that drives the action. And the future of both species is at stake and lies in the hands of Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, who returns as the hybrid super-breed. Whatever!The romance occurs between Becks and Speedman and features one of the more erotic love scenes you'll have the distinct pleasure of seeing in 2006.What are impressive in this sequel are the action sequences and the Gothic and graphic images. This film definitely steps the gore up to a new level. The creatures are shown in full detail, basked in that now familiar icy blue light that director Len Wiseman is so fond of using. The entire film is shot in a slightly desaturated black, white and icy blue palette casting shadows on spectacularly moody locations.The actions scenes are impressive. I consistently complain that what a lot of bad directors do during actions scenes, to cover up the fact that they have no idea what they are doing, is to use ridiculously quick cuts, unintelligible close ups, distractingly loud music, and introduce dust, smoke and fog to hide the details of the shots. Len Wiseman is utterly unafraid to show the details... confident that he has done his job well enough to show you all his tricks. Some of the actions scenes are even slowed down so that the audience can see, in even more detail, what is happening. Rarely did I feel disoriented during one of the action scenes in "Underworld: Evolution".All in all, this film was thoroughly entertaining. It was shot with a cool visual flare and took enough breaks from the action for us to catch our breaths and learn a little more about the characters. But mostly, this film gives us what we want and expect... Kate Beckinsale blasting a quadrillion bullets into the chests of hideous creatures while looking sublime doing it.It doesn't deserve an A grade because no film like this should ever warrant that kind of praise. But it is as good as it possibly could have been considering the genre, and that makes it a successful and worthwhile trip to the multiplex.© Written by TC Candler</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that the special effects that were cutting-edge for this movie's time have become not-so-impressive as the industry advances, the story itself is not creative or interesting enough to make it worth your time to direct your attention to the screen for almost two hours?unless you REALLY LOVE vampire or werewolf movies. If that's the case, let your freak flag fly! It's okay; I'm like that with football movies.

		<fullReview>The first Underworld film was OK thanks largely to a decent plot and Kate Beckinsale looking hot in a all in one leather outfit which seems to have kick-started a genre of horror staples such as vampires, werewolves, zombies and Frankenstein as superheroes and super villains.The sequel manages to entice Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy briefly and adds Derek Jacobi. I can see the casting agent on this one. Forget the Royal Shakespeare Company guys you need to follow in the footsteps of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and make horror films.In this sequel vampires and werewolves battle for supremacy among the undead. Sultry Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and hybrid Lycan Michael (Scott Speedman) try to untangle the secrets of their past and bloodlines. Jacobi is the father of two sons one who became the original vampire the other who became the original werewolf. The vampire Marcus (Tony Curran) plans to unleash a new force as he hunts down his brother entombed many centuries ago.The plot is confusing and convoluted. The film conveniently gives flashbacks to the original film, useful as I can hardly remember much about it. We have plenty of fight action sequences set in a blue neon tinged nighttime but its badly choreographed with cheapo CGI.The film suffers from horrid plotting and poorly drawn character arcs. A father who could had saved the world from a lot of bother if he forcefully dealt with his deviant sons. Yet one his offspring is happy to see off his dad.This is a letdown from the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, it's a Hope/Crosby road pic!... but without the humor. I mean *any* humor.The mythology starts to get a bit tangled here, as is usually the case as franchises like these go along. After a while I sorta gave up trying to make sense of what was going on and just went with it (I doubt it really effects your enjoyment--or lack thereof--either way).It's biggest sin is that it's just incredibly dull. Despite moving along at a brisk clip, the action is boring and repetitive and the soapy drama that helped jazz up the original is missing here, making this a rather hollow affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For 8 centuries, there has been a secret war between the ruling Vampires and rebellious Lycan. The two immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus are Markus bitten by a bat and William bitten by a wolf. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) had killed Viktor and is going to be hunted for it. She only has hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) to back her who is a direct descendant of Corvinus. She needs to wake last elder Marcus and expose the truth before Kraven has a chance to kill him. Kraven wakes Marcus but he's too powerful for Kraven. Marcus finds out that Selene killed Viktor and goes on the hunt for her.There is way too much backstory and way too much exposition. It drags down the movie before it could get started. The audience needs a scorecard to keep track of all the characters and all doublecrossing. The movie needs a simplified story with a beginning, a middle, and an ending. There is a lot of interesting action but most of it is wasted in this confused mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember much about this sequel other than it underwhelmed what little expectations I had going into it. The first movie is decent, but not anything to write home about. This one is much worse, and deadly dull in my opinion. For starters it's dreary looking; I didn't get the vibe I did from Kate Beckinsale like I did in the first one. She was one of the main reasons I didn't mind the first one, but here I didn't get that same feeling. It has some alright action scenes; Bill Nighy always adds class to anything he's in, but there just wasn't anything special about this movie. I'd like to know why this is rated 6.6?; I personally think it's around the 5 mark or so, and that is way too high for such an average sequel. Final Thoughts: If you liked the first one, you may enjoy this one. If you thought the first one was merely decent, than you might feel differently like I did. Has it's moments, but not nearly enough of them from what I can remember. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld is one of the most disappointing movie series I've ever come across. With such a cool concept of werewolves and vampires constantly battling to the death, how can it feel so un-exciting? By wooden acting, lame/boring writing, and just a bunch of fancy bullcrap.The story, is just a boring family heritage revenge story that I could give a sh!t about. "Your dad hurt my feelings and I'm gonna get him!" Well, it's not that bad, but it's in the same league. With such a weak and carefree story, your main focus is solely on the action. Which at points, is alright. You've got some decapitations, lots of bullet-flying (which should NOT be in werewolf vs. vampire flicks), and fancy special effects. I do admit I enjoyed the make-up effects and really liked the Big Bad Wolf....William...Marcus? Eh.The whole flick and series is not what these real horror icons should be doing to one another. It should be 10X more brutal. F the guns, and just them duke it the hell out. I suppose they tried to make it seem like they're doing this, but this ain't cutting it. And what's with that lame ass sex scene? That stunk. Not even a f@ckin nip.Underworld: Evolution is better than the first, but it still feels like a soap-opera with vamps and wolves. The effects and make-up though were quite good. Focus on the macabre instead of the action and this series could have been very memorable. But, obviously this will never be. F@ckin Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sick of people dissing movie simply because its not their 'type'. I you are going to comment on a movie, comment on it if you like it. Don't just say;"vampires are stupid!" like some do, get a life. 1.Anyway, most vampire or action fans prefer these movies set in a Gothic, big city, or country place. Underworld had all the dark, car chases, and city stuff, this one is more the opposite in setting. 2.It delivers a good dose of chases, gunfights, a LITTE romance to balance it out, and you get a better idea of who and why the characters are. This movie is basically set on Selene's background, and finding out even more truth than in Underworld.3.It has great special effects! Its eye candy to see Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and the others jumping around in the air with claws and guns! The werewolves are cool, and so are the vampire bats.4. It MAKES you buy the soundtrack. You wouldn't think this would have the best soundtrack, but check it out. Its filled with punk rock and stuff like Puscifer. Try some samples here: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=45417415.We pick up where we left off in Selene and Michael's relationship. Yeah, i know, it SOUNDS too romantic for this movie, but its only ONE scene. I must say, i know some children who were allowed to watch Underworld, but this one scene is NOT for kids. I had to watch it in secret(seeing as i am 12; I'm smart for my age, and a true vampire lover)!It does not actually show any nudity, but it definitely implies it. More of a sex scene than anything.6. Gore! For all the vampire, action, and horror fans out there, don't you hate it when people go "Ew..." at the sound of blood?? I do. This movie has plenty of it! From being impaled, to being shot, to decapitation, to knives, this movie has it all. A bit watery, though, but cool blood.7. Great acting! All anyone ever has to say about Kate in this movie is that we like to see her in skintight leather, but she acts very well. If you've seen what shes like off set, its more of a fun loving chick, and then you see her with guns and the stone, warrior face. There is not much of a difference in Scott and Michael, they are both normally behaved guys, but still, i was impressed that the cast said HE HAD A PROBLEM with shooting the sex scene, most guys i know would be ALL over her.BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! I've given enough reasons, if this isn't enough for you to watch it(plus the trailer) than, God, I'm getting the feeling you are obsessed with Britney Spears, or Christina Agulara. I don't care if spelled that wrong, JUST WATCH IT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Spiritual Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film measures up with the great epics like The Mahabharata, The Ramayana, or The Odyssey, where victims slay the demons released into the world. In defense of the violence in Underworld I and II, even the ancient classic epics were filled with violence -- and for a good reason: Good overcomes evil. Then there are the heroes. Selene is only superficially a monster. As a child, she is victimized by Viktor. After his resurrection, she follows him, idolizes him, seeks his help, and after learning the truth, that he killed her parents and turned her into a vampire, kills him. Michael is also victimized when he is bitten, and though they are monsters, this victimization allows us to sympathize with them.Both Underworld and its sequel take place entirely at night, where the dark forces thrive. In the end of the sequel, after the main characters kill the most powerful of the demons (both vampire and werewolf), the rising sun, the first light seen in either film, illuminates the world as the heroes celebrate their eternal life and love, and we are left to wonder how they will spend their eternity together. The Light has finally overcome the darkness. I am astonished that Underworld is Len Wiseman's directorial debut. To accomplish this great work of art so young in life is a testament to his genius.</fullReview>

To this sequel as Selene's character has to face the vampire Marcus and such. I don't want to give out the storyline of this movie because I know how much of a surprise this movie is even to 1st time Underworld seekers.

While I felt the story was very good and this movie had some incredible stunts and action moments, it just wasn't my cup of tea sort of speak.Kate Beckinsale may have something to do with it, while she's a very beautiful actress and talented in most of her movies, I couldn't believe her as a tough vampire for some reason. Also, I know there is a huge controversy of Vampire vs. Werewolves, it has been a horror fan favorite "vs." forever, but again, I just prefer the vampire flicks on their own stands.

With Underworld Evolution, Wiseman accomplished everything that he had wanted to put into the first.To begin with, I would have to say that the plot is fantastic. I've always liked this sort of movie, but with everything that happened with this, it was a notch above average.Next, the characters were very well acted out. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman play the perfect Selene and Michael. They have great chemistry between the two of them, and act well on their own as well.Special effects were breath taking. In the fight scenes, the special effects for lycans, Michael the hybrid, and the vampires were incredibly well done.Last but not least is the action scenes. The fights, which the movie is mostly composed of, were incredibly well laid out and executed perfectly.Hats off to Len Wiseman for creating a worthy, better-than-the-original sequel.Phenomenal!</fullReview>

Selene is pregnant, so whatever villain would be in the next could kill off Selene and Michael possibly after the Children have been born and then this can become a possible GREAT movie series that develops for the next decade or so because i think it deserves it.The Action was much better in Evolution. the amount of decapitations was NICE. of course i loved the new ways of the killings. the end which i wont give away was one of my favorite killings in the movie. i thought they dug much deeper into the plot from the first into this one and developed it greatly, overall i just believe this movie was spectacular and couldn't really get much better which is why i gave it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first UNDERWORLD and was stunned to see the sequel, because there were so much open questions.As ever Kate Beckinsale was great (sexy) and the plot answered a lot of questions that were open after the first part. Well...can't wait for the third part. ;) The other actors also did a nice job to create this dark mood I loved in the first part. The story was not that surprising like in the first part, but I already expected that.I also loved the production design of the movie, as it was done extremely brilliant and detailed. Some of the picture language was a bit false, but who cares, it all fitted the overall look of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off..id like to say great job and i tip my hat to you to Kate Beckinsale. Any woman who can keep up with the action and seriousness as the character of Selene is absolutely awesome! So Kate, girl you rock!! Well..when the movie began with the whole summary ans all in red i knew it was going to be great..the opening scene in a village and it jumps straight into the action. Followed by Selene and Michael traveling through the woods and finding an old mine to take refuge in. After that the dicovering of Markus and his new Hybrid God transformation. I really love the part where Selene jacks the truck and her and Michael battle Markus while moving. Its just so awesome..and amazing how the actors seem to fit in with their character. I was blown away by the ending fight where Selene kicks both Markus and a few lycans asses. Kyotaku the stray cat</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was better than I expected... it was as good as the first one. Only I think that the make-up and costume stuff were cooler! I mean, better than the last... and it created that fear in you when you looked at those werewolves. The sound effect was wonderful... the visual and special effects were good too. This one was scarier and it makes your heart thump like anything... There was a bit of swearing and a few sex scenes..., but who cares? The movie was cool, on the whole!!! the set thing, all the effects, and the story were excellent!!! And the actors acted well too and they did fit in well into their characters. Whatever the movie was a perfect one that I watched it twice... If I'd have had the time then, I'd have watched it more than twice. The sound effects and the story makes you sit and watch eagerly. Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale acted really well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tha best movie ever!!! With the ongoing tension between Selene and Michael, and their obvious feelings towards each other, this movie finally shows their temptations towards each other. The amazing chemistry of their characters makes the movie addictive (in a good way) and will stay on your mind for a long time. Although there is a certain extreme scene, the movie is that of a love story hidden between the lines. Many see Romeo and Juliet in Michael and Selene behind all the constant occurrences keeping them apart; you just might see the forbidden love too. This movie picks up where the first movie leaves off. However, after carefully listening to fans, it was decided that a smooch was not enough for Selene and Michael. Underworld: Evolution gives just enough!!! Wonderful movie... 10 out of 10. Recommend you see it (keep your young ones' eyes closed... you'll know when)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight forward sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is this sequel about? The first movie ends with a monologue; "Though I (Selene) can not predict the future, the consequences of this night will reverberate around the halls of both great covens for many years to come. Two vampire elders have been slain; one by my own hands. Soon Markus will take the throne and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night. Differences will be set aside, allegiances will be made, and soon I will become the hunted." Blood is seen dripping into Markus' coffin and he awakes with the hybrid eyes. So I went in with high hopes and certainly the first time I saw the movie, it was stunning. Thirty minutes into the film, something felt missing although I couldn't put my finger on it. The third time I saw it, it became clear what it was; a very simplistic plot. Certainly Selene can't predict the future because nothing of what she said at the end of the first movie is relevant to the sequel. Underworld Evolution is an action chase movie, unlike the first movie. All suspense is killed by three methods of introducing the movie. 1. We have text to say that actually Viktor lied about being the oldest, Markus is the son of Alexander Corvinus, oh and by the way, his twin brother William was the first lycan (werewolf). 2. There is a flashback to 1202AD where all three elders are awake trying to capture William who is too powerful and dangerous to be left to his own devices. 3. Selene's monologue, which felt like "Previously on Underworld!" with clips from the first movie. It felt like poor editing, and since no one could decide which one to use to open the movie, they threw in all three. Number one wasn't necessary and number two felt as if it was in the wrong place and should have been a revelation later in the movie. But poor editing is the theme throughout the movie. There is a pointless scene early on when Michael doesn't want to drink blood and so goes off to have human food despite being told not too; very frustrating to watch. It is difficult to convey what a character is thinking especially when the character is alone and this movie fails miserable by having an almost constant series of annoying flashbacks. There are no real questions that the audience has to ask during the movie (unlike the first movie), except why is Markus after Sonja's pendent? Since so much is revealed early on, it's not difficult to work out. I pray that there is major re-editing for the DVD release.Some new information is given as to how Viktor became an elder and why he killed Selene's family. Markus is fully explored but after two movies, a number of plot holes exist. We still know nothing about Amelia's past, why they had the chain and council and why all three elders are awake in 1202AD despite them leapfrogging through time for 14 centuries. There are also date discrepancies between the two movies. Now whilst some of them maybe explained in the novelizations or by groups of hardcore fans sifting through interviews and going through detailed process of logic, the information is missing from the movies. The result is a feeling of being cheated.This movie had a lot of potential, and still has with a lot of re-editing but the structure pales in comparison to the first movie. Sadly the writers and director have fallen into the Hollywood pit of tragedy; artistic shots, lots of bullets and fingers crossed that it makes money. The potential score is 9/10 but in its current form, 5/10. I've used the former since I'm a die-hard fan and any new info was brilliant and I hope for another sequel because there is just so much left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Underworld i really liked it a lot. I am really upset at some of the critics who are saying that this film wasn't even funny! The genre for this film is Horror/Action. I saw Underworld 2 not to far from when I saw the first one and I really liked it a lot. People if you have the nerve to check up online what some of the shitty stuff critics are going to say about a movie that you might be interested in seeing please don't. I really hate it when some high and mighty critic says (and yes I found out from a source) that the only reason Kate Beckinsale is in Underworld 1 &amp; 2 is because her husband directed it. I MEAN COME ON! What an immature thing to say. It makes me really mad when I look at a whole list of what the critics. If anyone has seen either seen Underworld 1 or 2 and you didn't like it fine move on don't bother seeing it anymore but if you did like it a lot you don't want someone saying that this has got to be the worst movie ever no one should see it. It saves a lot of frustration.I just want to say that i read comments on Yahoo and i cant believe it. A person wrote that this movie was so horrible and had porn in it! OMFG! BAH! The sex scene between Michael and Selene was passionate, the fell in love with each other, it is not porn! It meant something and when you learn not to say stuff (I cant swear on this thing) like that maybe you will find someone that will give you passionate sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on my top 5 movies and it is number 1. I would call it Very good, and well thought out. The Director did a good job on carrying on the legend and it is a worthy sequel in my book, the only one of its kind. Very Very Good acting by everybody in it. Tony Curran Is a very good actor, I don't get why we don't see more of him. It also was a pity we did not see more of Lucian, He is a good actor also. It lived up to its name of a sequel, All other sequels fall in comparison to this one. Len Wiseman is a brilliant director and deserves what ever awards they give him for the movie. Even the soundtrack is Good, I watched the first Underworld and loved the soundtrack, So what was there to stop me from buying the second one, And in my opinion Worth every penny I would buy it again and again. I Loved the whole feel that Len Wiseman gave to the movie, Not too dark yet not too sunny. Everything about this movie is awesome right down to every little contact they used.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw the first one Underworld when it first came out, and, afterwards, bought it as soon as it came out. My boyfriend and I went and saw Underworld : Evolution the Friday it came out and are still talking about how great it was. I can grantee that when this one comes out on DVD I will buy it. I was impressed with how they made sequel pick up where the first one ended. For anyone who hasn't yet seen "Underworld : Evolution", should take my advice and go and see it. It has everything the original has and has even more action that will leave you on the end of your set and then talking about it for days. I loved the movie and I think a lot of people need to stop with all the bad reviews saying that Underworld : Evolution is not as good as the first because they are both equally great and in both Seline kicks ass!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I rated this movie a 10, it is not "Gone with the Wind". But when considering the type of film it is, a 10 is what it scores. From the beginning of the film to the very end, I hardly left the edge of my seat, and the next thing I knew the film was over, time had simply flown by. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely breath taking, and the cinematography is superb. The film is full of outstanding action, but there is a story and a plot. I love the first film and I loved this the second, and I can't wait for a third. I must admit that if this film had been made with someone other than Kate Beckinsale in the lead, the movie may not have worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, Lots of gore and violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot more violence, gore and blood than the first movie - right off the bat (no pun intended). It did have more lore and more history regarding the feud between the vamps and the lycans. Which was great because I saw the first movie, but forgot the specific details of it. The movie had an equally explicit sex scene in it, I think you can guess between who. So please, don't bring your young children to the movie. The dialog was sparse, the stunts believable and the make up was very good. The story line was a little flat though. It would seem that once a character determined that firing an automatic rifle into the head bad guy really didn't slow him down, that she would use something else. But then again, we wouldn't get to see him heal quickly if the weapon was effective. Overall, I would not recommend spending a small fortune for this movie at the theater. However, if you can maneuver a free ticket, there are several landscape type scenes where the big screen is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I guess part three has been ruled out. As I watched this movie I came to realize that structurally there are many similarities between Underworld Evolution and Terminator 2, most significantly including the closing narration and the final scene. I wont mention any more than that because I don't want to throw any spoilers away. But I will add that the relationship between Selina and Michael, on the run, being hunted down by Marcus, a powerful, unstoppable vampire, the original vampire, seems too close to the premise of T2. There are also down scenes where the characters have to take shelter from the daylight, so you have again these quiet moments in between the high slotted action sequences. James Cameron would be proud, because as they say, imitation is the highest form of flattery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started with a war scene in the past where we can find out a little history about the Corvinus family, Marcus (Tony Curran), the first Vampire and his brother William, the very first Lycan. As the story continue, Marcus try to set his brother free from the secret prison built by Viktor (Bill Nighy), the former Vampire leader. Vampire heroine Selene (Kate Beckinsale) teams up with Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a hybrid, try to stop Marcus from his ambition. Kate Beckinsale and Scoot Speedman are good as the lead character, but their characters didn't have any significant development like in the first movie. The only thing that developed is their relationship. We can really feel the connection between them and how much they really care for each other. Story wise, I think this sequel is better that the previous movie. But surely these movies work well together. Won't be good if you see only one of them. Probably there's going to be a third underworld, it's clearly stated in Selene's monologue at the end of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picking up right where it left off, Selene and Michael are on the run, needing to clear their names and expose the lies spread by Victor. Marcus, the last of the ruling vampires has awoken, and is out for one thing; Selene. Selene holds the keys to a mystery that Marcus wishes to unlock, so Selene and Michael will stop at nothing to stop Marcus at all cost.In true fashion of a sequel, Underworld Evolution doubles the action, doubles the violence and gore; with a cascading river of blood, and an out of the blue sex scene to round it all off. For all this increase of action, the story in compromised and dwindles in the back. The story is convoluted, but as the popcorn movie Underworld Evolution is, it doesn't really matter. Glossing over many plot holes and the shoe string story, the action is relentless, with a constant run of walls and ceilings being brought to splinters and rubble in peoples grand entrances; the door is never dramatic enough. So with that respect it never falls in entertaining. The shining aspect is the art direction, with exceptionally detailed sets, enhanced by the steel blue wash of the film.A prerequisite of Evolution is that you do need to be a fan of first Underworld. This is strictly directed towards the fan base of the first film, as you aren't give much back information from the first film, only glimpses in flashbacks. We are given more back story, with the film starting at the time of the war, and rivalry between Marcus and Victor.Stiff and rigid is a fair assumption of the acting. Kate Beckinsale struts her stuff in her body hugging, leather clad outfit. Scott Speedman snarls and gruffs his way though. Bill Nighy and Tony Curran are both over the top, falling into comical than dramatic.Underworld Evolution is pretty hollow, but is an entertaining watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't understand why the ratings on this film have been so ridiculously high... this movie has the intellectual quality of a hamster running in a wheel... full of werewolves and vampires, gratuitous sex, and over-the-top violence.All of the sex in the movie was entirely random and completely unnecessary. Not that sex in movies is a bad thing, it's good when it has a definitive purpose, other than getting a few more horny teenagers to purchase tickets.The violence was gory, which is expected in anything involving more than a single horror creature, but some things boarded on idiotic. The most notable case was when the elder vampire, Markus, had one of his own wingtip broken off and rammed into his skull only then to be pushed into rotating helicopter blades. Plus, watching werewolves having their heads ripped in half by the their upper jaw loses its appeal after about the third time.The plot was weak, with the main premise being an old cliché: "Stop the ancient evils from killing everything." Done and buried, that one.The only thing helping this movie are some great special effects, and some memorable action sequences.Other than that, there's not much to look forward to, unless you're a hardcore fan of Underworld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first Underworld movie, I thought - okay, not very deep, but nice, moody, playing on the recently popular modern-Gothic-vampire style, well-played and pleasant to watch. From its sequel, I expected nothing less.Instead of describing the movie, perhaps I'll just describe the reactions of the audience - being fresh after watching Underworld 1, as this was a "marathon" screening. Is the audience supposed to start to giggle when quick and messy shots present a big hairy plush toy being pierced with various weaponry, never zooming out to a full set, as if it was a cheap B-movie? Is the audience expected to cringe in mock "awwww"s when a sex scene begins all of a sudden with no plot buildup leading to it, and start laughing out loud at the ridiculous positions the "lovemaking" actors assumed? Should the audience start yawning at the inside shots of a character's ribcage transformation, repeated two or three times through the movie? Should the audience almost synchronously slap their foreheads at a scene when a human-sized creature pulls a large aircraft down from the sky by just standing on the ground and yanking on a cable dangling from it? Should almost all major fight scenes end in dismemberment of the fallen, until the final "bosses" are literally shredded to pieces, having the audience cheer "shish kabob for dinner"?See, in fact it was a triple screening: Underworld, Underworld Evolution, and John Carpenter's Vampires. Underworld is a nice modern vampire/werewolf movie with some cheesy fx, JC's Vampires is pure unrestricted B-class cheese... and, lo and behold, Underworld Evolution couldn't be placed better right between the two! Not a good way to go, I'd say.4/10 - pros: decent acting, well-paced music, nice shots; cons: cliché script, "rubber-monster" special effects, bad creature rendering, unnecessary amounts of gore and nudity, repeated footage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was such a good film that I even went back to the theater a couple days later to see it a second time. If you liked Underworld, then I can guarantee you'll love the sequel. The story picks up right where the first film left off, except for a brief intro that takes us back like a prequel to build the story a bit more, but then swiftly returns to the present and boldly wages the battle forward. There's ass-kicking, gunfire, a steamy almost nude love scene, lots of blood, and great twists and turns in the story that never leave you bored. I would have to say the most impressive aspect of this film was the special effects. I thought the transformations from human to Lycan were extraordinary and so believable, it was hard to tell when CGI took over. Another bonus I enjoyed was the smooth transition of the story between the two films, where one ends, two picks up and it all feels like one big story. It wasn't your typical sequel that had a different story, but shared the same title as it's original only adding 'part 2'.If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend it, even if your not a fan of the Vampire/Werewolf genre. There is a great story to be told and a unique vision of the world of vampires and werewolves that mixes old school with modern times. See Underworld first then make sure to catch Underworld: Evolution in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damion Crowley's Review of Underworld: Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution is a spectacular display of special effects and choreography thrown over a reasonable story-line that embraces with enthusiasm the lore of vampires and werewolves.I'll be honest, I didn't enjoy the first one; I'll even take it on the terms that it personally didn't appeal to me, as the original was technically quite competent. It just didn't hold my interest. I came into the sequel just to be with friends, and left the theater pleasantly surprised.I think the strongest selling point of this movie is the special effects. Some FX may be better, but I've not seen a director who understands his limitations and capabilities and executes them so well. Not George Lucas, not Spielberg, or a host of hundreds of other directors. Additionally, make up and costumes created an environment of highly realistic appearing characters.Secondly, the plot, while occasionally dizzying and burdensome, was far more interesting this time around. Selene and Michael Corvin are on the run after the havoc from the first movie, and their journey takes them on a discovery of truth about the origins of werewolves and vampires.The combination of pacing, story, plot and special effects lead to an exciting story and quite a few moments of awe at the scenes of battle as the two immortal races tear into each other.The weakest link in the "Underworld: Evolution" is the acting. While everyone does seem enthusiastic, at least, there is a few eye-rolling moments in the delivery of dialog, the worst offender being Bill Nighy's performance. Scott Speedman does a good job as the hybrid, but delivers his lines in a dull fashion. Either the director noticed, or he lucked out, as he did not linger long on either one's acting.Certainly worth a check at the theaters, perhaps even at night-time prices. 7 on 10-point scale, 7.4 on the 100-point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has no reason to exist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is focused on delivering excitement and flash for teenage boys, and it utterly fails to distinguish itself in any way. Above all, it suffers from weak character development and unexciting, gratuitous action and sex sequences. Despite its action/horror designation, it fails to impress on almost every level since it relies on tired techniques and clichéd genre archetypes. Firstly, the beginning half hour of the movie aims to bring viewers not familiar with the franchise up to speed on the events of the first film. It accomplishes this through a lengthy text introduction and boring flashback scenes shot in the frenetic, disorienting style that has become the standard for action movie memory sequences. Many of the beginning shots are in fact recycled from the previous film. Ironically, knowledge of the original's plot is almost completely unnecessary, since the movie devolves almost immediately into a string of action scenes devoid of any gravity. The characters of this movie are all almost wholly uninteresting since their motives are incomprehensible. They rarely express realistic emotion, and any relationship between two characters seems artificial due to poor script writing. A fairly gratuitous sex scene involving Beckinsale feels particularly forced and the unnecessary shots of her bare skin suggest that it was included only to appease lusting adolescent males. In the end, I found it very hard to care about the outcome of the story or what became of any character. The failure of the writers and director to carry out any believable character interaction really ruins the experience. Then, to add insult to injury, the action itself is relatively boring and unoriginal. Aside from the fact that the enemies are Werewolves instead of Agents or Aliens, there is no innovation that distinguishes this movie from other action fare. Whereas The Matrix reinvented action through unique direction, this film relies on clichéd techniques and already established standards. Above all, this forgettable movie fails to excite, thrill or frighten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting opening third gives way to a confusing middle and downright boring finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the original UNDERWORLD, I walked out feeling like I wasted two hours of my life. But, as I usually do, I bought it on DVD anyway and ended up really liking it once I discovered the (get this) complexity of its storyline! That's right, that movie actually had a story behind it that was pretty interesting. Needless to say, I was really interested to see how this sequel would pick things up. What was Marcus going to do when he woke up? Would Selene have to go into exile? Will the war continue? So, I settled in for EVOLUTION and for about thirty minutes, I was floored! Marcus comes out like a bad mother jumper and doesn't just decapitate one character's head - that wouldn't be cool enough - no, he OBLITERATES his head! Yeah, Marcus means business. Shortly thereafter, one of the best sequences of either movie takes place in the form of an intense mountain road truck chase. So far, so good.Then, Len tries to launch us into a new bit of story. But not before stopping over for what has to be one of the most gratuitous and laughable sex scenes in recent years. I'm not kidding, people were LAUGHING in the theater! The characters are contorted into some strange position and Michael looks like he's not sure where things go - I'll just leave it at that. And not too long after, we get a gratuitous T&amp;A shot of some miscellaneous woman that feels just as tacked on. YAWN.But the real problem comes in at this point. The character of Tanis fills our heroes in on what Marcus is doing, and after three minutes straight of exposition, I finally gave up trying to follow along. I still don't understand what the plot of this sequel was! Well, then our heroes go on to meet a surprise character who, given who he turns out to be, is VERY anti-climatic. All this leads up to the final action showdown - yet by this point even poor Selene seems bored with the proceedings. I think the quintessential image of this movie is Selene firing round after round from her pistols at the head Lycan while standing firmly in one place for about a full minute or two. It's like the producers decided they were tired of choreographing fight scenes so they just said, "Eh, just stand in one place and shoot at him for a few minutes - that'll be good enough for this scene." As it is, the final dispatching of one of the main baddies is so quick that if you were looking away from the screen for a moment you might miss it. The other is somewhat satisfyingly nasty, but again the action leading up to it is pretty boring.And poor Michael - after being the focus of the first movie, he hardly seems to be able to do anything in this one besides react and ask questions. An early promise to show him coping with his new found Vampire/Lycan properties goes NOWHERE! So, what happened to our great story that the first movie set us up for? For the duration of this movie, Selene and Michael seem to be the only Vamps left in the world (plus the four or five from the helicopter at the end). Where is this war that we keep hearing about? By the time the movie was in its final act, I had taken on the idea that Selene was the last remaining Vampire in the world (which Derek Jacobi seems to nearly explicitly state). Yet in her closing monologue she refers to clans and battle lines and revenge and wars . . . oh, OK, so there ARE still others out there?? Eh, by that time I was ready to go home and go to bed. Too bad - this really could have been a great sequel if more time had been given to developing the characters and less time on sex and blood/gore/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously! WHAT is this?! You call this a story? Who wrote this script?Imagine someone offering this to a movie company or whatever... "A story? Oh, come now! Why would you bother yourself with that? We have better things than that. Like CGI or Kate Beckinsale. Dark European country of Hungary, where for some reason cops look like they guard a national border all the time and everyone looks like a bum and where you can speak Hungarian or Russian if you like..." "All right, I'm convinced! Here is your budget!"What the...?It seems to me like there is some kind of ancient cliché pattern that every Hollywood movie has to follow!In this case: - we got some old grandpa vampire and his two sons that are pure evil for some reason- one of them is trying to become a god but he first needs to get to his brother for some reason - for this he needs two keys (yes, that's right, welcome to the wonderland)- in the end bad guys die but only after they managed to kill everyone else except the two main characters (because let's be frank, they didn't deserve to live, they are just some people trying to help our two beautiful, god-like heroes)One scene almost surprised me, when one of the main characters died. Oh wait, he is SPECIAL! So he comes around to save the day at the end.Oh, and if you like clichés and irrational things in general, than you will love the ending. That is like the mother of all...- a bridge segment will collapse under a careful step of an ordinary human soldier, but if a giant werewolf jumps on it (or a helicopter lands on it), it's just fine- these are vampires and werewolves, yet they fight like some shaolin monks or street fighters- William, the werewolf who gets freed by his brother Marcus turns out to be a lame white wolf who likes to stand on the scene growling, while the others are feeding him bullets. What is he a masochist?- Oh yeah, the scene when Marcus is being held by the large door while the fighting continues is just so stupid. It looks like he needs to go but the toilet is occupied.- Also what do you think will happen when Kate starts to fight the bad guy Marcus in front of a rolling blades of a helicopter?- And the cheesy ending of Kate saying: "I look into the light with new hope..." You can't look into the light silly, you are a vampire! :)))So no, don't watch it...Seriously though - don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really amazed because of how much they referred back to the original underworld. If you had not seen Underworld before you saw Evolution then I believe you would be completely lost! The story was very well play with plenty of action. I mean honestly as far the action goes I don't believe it could have been better! I believe the story has reached a stopping point and should be left were it is. I mean honestly what could really be a challenge to them? Its not very often you see a fantasy/horror/action movie thats worth spending 9.50 to watch opening weekend. With the sequel being as good as the original if not better I recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action packed but a bit too... normal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings: at my arrival to the press screening of "Underworld: Evolution" I was plenty of doubt. I had heard comments on how it was a dull, boring and, in short, bad movie, worse than the previous one, that didn't ask at all to be seen. Well, I have not seen "Underworld", so the comparison was of no help. On the other hand, her at IMDb I had read an overpraising review, making it shine like a great action movie, full of interesting and unexpected plot twists, marvelous character portrayals... Well, that one looked like overkill. And after watching the movie, I see both takes were, to my experience, wrong.There's nothing boring in "Underworld: Evolution", at least if you expect an action packed movie. There are shootings, brawls, jumps, wounds, magic, traps, monsters, blood, kills... And they are basically quite well shot.But there's also very little "unexpected" in the plot: barely everything in the great scheme of the movie was expected right from the first, setting scene. The way to reach to the big parts of that plot *was* obscure, but in my opinion it was not a feature but an error: the story was unexpected on those moments because it was plenty of details that, in any franchise based on published material (Marvel, DC, book sagas, etc) would be evident to anybody, but only because there is no pre-existing world for the watched it is plain "obscure". And on the other hand they are constantly remembering us that "this is just the World of Darkness... but changing the names" Because, sorry: I didn't find any of the "pathos" and "character depth" announced by some. Perhaps a bit over most action flicks in the secondary roles, but very few on the major characters (both heroes and antagonists). But our regular "Vampire: Dark Ages" characters have more depth than most of this story shows...FINAL NOTE: Watch "Underworld" first if you pretend to see "Evolution", because the first 20 minutes of the film are full of references to names and events of the first movie, and even with the short flashbacks shown it's hard to get hold, for a while, of whose name's supposed to be in charge, an enemy or dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this movie was better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay - granted I like most movies people normally hate, such as the first Underworld or the Blade movies (even Electra wasn't soo bad), I believe that this movie was better than the first. It brought in some romance, which, though the movie was a little gory and violent, it helped to tone down the violence. I also think that Kate BEckinstale is a mesmerizing actress and enjoyed her performance as well as Scott Speedman's in this sequel. I found how they tied the sequel to the first movie incredibly interesting and unpredictable. Without giving any spoilers, I walked into the movie with an idea of how the plot would conspire, and I was thrown for a little twist. The plot doesn't veer off so much from the first movie that it's ridiculous, but it gives the movie something to work with. So there you have it - I absolutely LOVED this movie, but I am also incredibly impartial to action movies where women are in control and kicking ass. If you feel the same - then you must see this movie!! If you like really "deep" or drama filled movies like Brokeback Mountain or Million Dollar Baby - perhaps not the movie for you. But I loved Underworld Evolution and have already seen it 2x in theaters!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good film, and enjoyable. WARING THOUGH: YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE FIRST ONE.THE GOODS: Kate Beckinsale looks hotter without her hot leather outfit The film picks up immediately after the first one, and i mean immediately. The story flows directly together as one cohesive unit while revealing new details about the underlworld,,, umm,, uhh,,, world.Kate Beckinsale looks hotter without her hot leather outfit Michael has a great scene where he tests the nature of being a vampire by eating real food. I thought this was actually a very good touch. What does happen? It's a good thing to draw you into the pros and cons of being a vampire. Michael is just a great character anyway. he's strong but submissive and trusting. He knows that he is the rookie, but he uses his strength like a pro.Kate Beckinsale looks hotter without her hot leather outfit.The action is good, the visual looks of the creatures is good, the feel of the film is good, the acting, the direcing, etc. All of it is good.Also, the revelation of the more ancient history of the vampires is very interesting, and is really what i went to see the movie for. I love vampire flicks for their history, I mean, you have an immortal creature. Just imagine what they've seen in their time, and how much their life has changed over the course of their history. What would a man born five thousand years ago think of this day and age. It's an intriguing thought, and the movie does a good job of approaching those issues. Should there be a third film, they'll likely need to relay on that idea.Oh and trust me, Kate Beckinsale is hotter without her hot leather outfit on.THE BADS: Once again, this film kills off nearly every major character. I haven't quite understood that yet, it seems silly. A: you've destroyed anything you've created to build on. B: what is the likelihood that now dozens of these immortal creatures, who have lived for centuries upon centuries, have all died withing weeks of each other. It just seems chaotic. I really don't know where else they can go with future films, unless they just aren't planning on it. They'll have to invent some people we've never heard of before.The intesity that you felt with michaels character from the first one isn't there anymore. How great was it to watch michael running away from shoot out after shoot out. I mean think about it. He was going to get on a train. All of a sudden there's a shootout. Then his house is broken into, selene captures him, some crazy looking guy bites the heck out of him in the elevator, he wakes up to a snarling vampire, he jumps out a two story window, dogs chase him, more shooting, he gets in a major car wreck, he gets thrown out of a window, some crazy guys abduct him, etc. etc. etc. This doesn't really exist at all in the 2nd film.So watch it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>blood, guts, and gore; no more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question of the day is; How much is too much? That was the general impression I was left with after watching Underworld: Evolution.Now I enjoyed the story, and the characters were interesting. The problem was the fight scenes were too bloody, too brutal, too long, and too many. I mean, how many times do we have to watch someone bite someones else's neck half off, or tear off their jaw? How many rounds of bullets do we have to see being plugged into another body to figure out that the guy is gonna die? How much blood has to fly through the air and soak everything in sight for us to realize that killing someone is, well, bloody? I do admit, for all the skin they showed us in the lovemaking scene without revealing Kate's boobies or Scott's donger was impressive. Good uh, camera angles and editing on that, I guess you could say. But the rest? It was just way too much.The first installment, Underworld, was violent and bloody, and yes, there was sex too. But the action was not so overwhelming that we lost the story in all the blood, guts, and gore. In Evolutions, there were times when I literally turned to the person next to me and asked if this story was going anywhere or was it just one blood spilling ultra violent scene after another? The person didn't know, but did say that they thought they had seen enough blood, guts, and gore in the first five minutes, and that they wouldn't allow their kids too see this movie until they turned twenty. I must say that I agreed.So with the next installment, I make but one request. (we know there will be another, they left it wide open for one) A little more story and a lot less action would be nice. We saw all the blood, guts, and gore we could handle in part 2.my vote: seven out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Underworld Evolution. Yes it has it's moments when you are lost as to the plot, but that is one of the few faults of it in my opinion. They took what they did in the first film and improved it. The weapons are better and accurate to the real thing and the fight scenes were way better than the first one. What I mean by the guns is that the silver matched pistols she has a full auto in the first movie(which in reality they are not!)and they fixed that in this one.As to the plot yeah there were a few things that didn't match up with the first movie, such as Lucian and how he came along and what he has to do with Marcus, and in general how the war all started. But with the wide open ending I smell a trilogy in the making!I love Kate Beckinsale, I saw in Pearl Harbor and I wasn't impressed with her, but in these kind of films she kicks butt, which I like. I can't wait till the DVD comes out.If you like guns, vampires and a very hot Kate Beckinsale, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

Kate Beckinsale is excellent in this film, even more so than the first one, Scott Speedman as Michael also does a very good job. I found this film very entertaining, one of the best vampire films out there. If you liked the original at all, you will love "Evolution". The very origins of the immortals are revealed in this movie and the details are explained quite well. We also see Selene and Michael become more intimate, which was actually very tastefully done. Now obviously I'm not a skilled review writer, but I do know fiction and this film delivers everything you could possibly want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luke-warm at best, the plot was somewhat better than the first although I really don't like Selene...she is frigid to the point that the sex scene was forced, and really there is nothing worse than watching awkward sex. The visual effects are pretty good, but obviously this movie has nothing on the likes of 'King Kong' or 'The Chronicles of Narnia'...go see those movies instead!On a personal note, I would like to see the werewolf genre revived and enhanced. Since the original 'Howling' and 'American Werewolf in London' with the introduction of CGI the transformation sequences are generic and not personal. The strengths of this movie (the very few) lay in Beckinstale &amp; Speedman's abilities to convey through acting rather than makeup the supernatural abilities of their characters. And c'mon, a blue dude with black eyes is really not that freaky..he looks like an X-Men reject.Wait for the DVD if you're at all interested in this movie, its not worth the price of admission so don't encourage Hollywood to make more of these mediocre sci-fi/fantasy thrillers.</fullReview>

Selene and Michael, our two protagonists do a good job of portraying heroes-on-the-run. But they aren't just escaping, they are trying to uncover the reason the war with vampires and werewolves has been raging for so many generations. What they find is a blood tie that changes the whole face of the war. Selene and Michael both find a their greater potentials and destiny as well, while slaying the fiercest foes along the way. For action fans and gore lovers only! If you don't like plenty of decapitations, impaling and amputations, stay away, LOL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hero with a Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale is stunningly beautiful on screen. As Vampire Death Dealer Selene she is bold and sexy in her skin tight black leather with automatic weapons blazing battling both Vampire and Lycan (Werewolf). There are darkly lit scenes with her wet matted hair streaming down her face that are a testament to that amazing beauty. Beckinsale also commands "Underworld Evolution" with a strong heroic presence. Director Len Wiseman's sequel "Underworld Evolution" is captivating for its evolution of Beckinsale's Selene as a hero. "Underworld" was an interesting Gothic take on "Romeo and Juliet" with Vampire and Lycan. At the center of the story was Michael (Scott Speedman), who was a direct descendant of the Immortal Cornivus bloodline that produced both Vampire and Lycan. Corvinus's son Marcus (Tony Curran) became Vampire and his son William became Lycan. Screenwriter Danny McBride details this 800 year old mythology in "Underworld Evolution", and the quest for Marcus to reunite with his brother William. Selene holds the key to this quest.Michael is a hybrid both Vampire and Lycan, perhaps more powerful than both. Along with Selene they are discovering the extent of his power. Discovering her own betrayal, Selene is no longer aligned with the Vampire, and is on the run with Michael. The two fall in love, culminating in a sensual yet tasteful love scene. Selene and Michael track down exiled Vampire historian Tanis (Steven Mackintosh) to unravel Selene's pivotal role in Marcus's quest to find William. This leads them to seek out the mysterious and powerful Alexander (Derek Jacobi). It also seems that Marcus himself is a hybrid of sorts hinting to his immortal origins. It is unclear what the ultimate motive is or if there is a prize.Wiseman and McBride do well in keeping their narration lean in a convoluted tale, along with good pacing and great action. Some of the CGI effects particularly with Marcus are cheesy. The dialog for the most part is engaging. However, there are some awkward F words from Selene. Though intended as dramatic, coming from a 400 year-old character is a bit out of context. A "No!" would have sufficed. It's awesome to see Sir Derek Jacobi on the screen again. He does lend gravitas to the movie as Alexander in a surprising twist. A miscalculation may have occurred with Marcus (Curran). Curran seems like a gifted actor though his Marcus is so literally inhuman that there is no pathos for him as a villain. Speedman is charismatic as Michael, the hybrid discovering his vast power. "Evolution" is really Kate Beckinsale's showcase. She is confident and strong as Selene. Her Selene is so cool, smart, and understated. In this case less is more. As the evolving hero of the story, Beckinsale hints at a sense of sadness and regret which is effective in our empathy for Selene. Beckinsale is also very impressive in all action scenes whether it's martial arts or her expertise with automatic weapons."Underworld Evolution" is solid entertainment. There are parts that could have been stronger. Overall the story is captivating in this Gothic action thriller. Kate Beckinsale is a strong action star in the making. She has amazing cool, charisma, and great style. She makes "Underworld Evolution" worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolutions makes no sense.There, it had to be said. If you're looking for a candidate for the Oscars, don't go to this movie for it because quite frankly, nothing in it really makes a lot of sense.To pinpoint exactly what I mean, try and figure out where this story is set. At the dock (?) they speak French, however the police speak another language (Hungarian???), and of course lets not forget how the Vampires and Lycans speak English...although given the myriad of accents, the story could be set in London, New York, or whatever.Add to this the presence of the ship, the proximity of the "exile" locale, and one could go on and on, and what you have is a story that is ultra devoid of consistency and cohesion, with very little in the way of glue.Yet the movie is visually stunning, and features a charismatic performance by the always fantastic Kate Beckinsale as the Death Dealer Celine. The story centers around her efforts to head off the release of the first Lycan, William, by his brother and the first Vampire, Marcus.The effects are amazing, the cinematography is fantastic, and practically everyone is beautiful, with the possible exception of the Lycans and Marcus himself. A visual feast to be sure, and one that may be worth the money to see on the big screen! Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

There is also the element of mystery used to introduce some characters, and everything is explained very well as it all ties together nicely. If you like action, Kate Beckinsale, good storytelling and monsters, it will keep your interest. Remember this is an action/horror so it's not everyone's cup of tea.

		<fullReview>To begin, I love the vampire myth. Granted, it hasn't turned out the most impressive films in our time, but I always find myself willing to give them a chance. The recipe for a successful story is there, exploration of death and immortality, man's struggle over his bestial nature, the perplexing essence of blood. But in the case of vampire films, its rarely paned out. The thoughtful existentialism that would seem to naturally compliment the carnal side of the story is lacking. Like food that is too sweet and rich, it is hard swallow. When I saw the first Underworld I was an instant fan, by far my favorite film of the genre. Kate Beckinsale was a superb choice for the role; her graceful and angelic quality and skill as an actress carries both movies through some difficult terrain. In Underworld: Evolution, the story takes off directly where the first ended, seeing the first movie is essential. In the first 15 minutes the pace is quickened and for all purposes the movie sits poised to exceed its classy predecessor. Where things go awry is just after the first major action sequence. What starts out as a tender and romantic moment between the main characters, becomes a raunchy sex scene nearly identical to the Matrix: Reloaded one. After which I shake my head at all directors who throw sex scenes awkwardly into their movies hoping for an extra buck at the box office. Although slightly disappointing, it wasn't nearly as saddening as when our main characters come upon another vampire while he's in the middle of a threesome. At that point I sighed and hung my head as what I thought would be one of the coolest films of our generation degenerated into just another okay vampire movie. Other than these two ill conceived and injected scenes, the action is great, the acting believable, and the story excellent, and perhaps that makes it even more tragic. Like a really great symphony that only messed up horribly twice, all you can remember is those two mistakes, the discord poison that caused everything else to die with it. It is worth watching at least once, but you should check your expectations from the original at the front door.</fullReview>

However, when I got there five minutes to the hour, I was only to discover that it had started at 20:30 for some reason and as a result, missed out on seeing it. The 'new' 21:00 screening was this and I wasn't prepared to waste a trip so I decided to see it.Bear in mind that I haven't seen the first Underworld film whilst commenting on this and I do not make it a habit of seeing sequels before first films, but the situation that be-fell me was unfortunate to say the least. The story of the film may sound pretty basic but if you look a little deeper you have quite a sophisticated idea in the mould revolving around a war between two of classical Hollywood's 'classic monsters', i.e.; the werewolves (bizarrely named 'lycans') and vampires. However, these aren't your typical conventional classical horror vampires, in fact they are almost straight out of 'Blade' (1998) given the fact they're all mainly young, handsome, rebellious and have a thirst for guns as well as blood.Although a little tricky to follow at first, the story opens up through a series of flashbacks to what I presume to have been the first film. For me, this was vital as I was going in blind on this one but for others who have seen the first one, it seems that the flashbacks were unnecessary and, in a way to some, almost 'insulting'. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I was really in the dark when the film got going after the opening fight scene at the snowy village. Various different events and characters were building up/happening and it was rather overwhelming. The film DID regain some clarity, however, when they visited a character known as 'Tanis' (Played by an actor I instantly recognised from 'Lock, Stock...') These included the back ground on a certain key/emblem as well as rather important flashbacks the heroine has of the childhood and how everything is connected. For people seeing this without seeing the first film, I felt this scene was pretty important. Various fight scene dotted throughout the film also aided the cause.At times, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to impress the audience. Everything seemed very dark and Gothic, which I can understand it being a horror film involving vampires which have to stay out of light, but it seemed very forced; all most as if you were trying to read a comic book on a subway train with the electrics cutting out at random moments- the story is there for you to follow but it's hard to make everything out entirely if you see what I mean. There are also significant references to other action films made in the last 10-15 years. Nearer the end, it seems nothing more than a montage of Terminator/Matrix-esquire stunts and set pieces which are there to build everything up to its rather predictable climax, and that can't be good. However, the acting was all right and the camera work was rather artistic. The editing is sharp and unnoticeable, especially the few full frontal shots of Beckinsale's character in her cat suit which occur at random parts of the film which cut off to the next shot JUST as you realise what you're looking at. The fight scenes and sparse use of slow motion also keep everything feeling unique as does the constant presence of the antagonist vampire whom remains a menacing threat throughout. The film doesn't come without its gore; in fact most of the actors could probably write a dissertation on how good/bad the fake blood tastes given the amount of times we see it in their mouths, not to mention the amount of takes it probably took for them to get it right(!) Let that be a hint of what to expect along with the point blank shooting, werewolf decapitation and true 'Evil Dead' style melee attacks from certain characters. I probably would've enjoyed this a little more if I had seen the first film first (as I've explained, I haven't) but it did alright for me in the end and fans of the first will probably love this one if it's supposedly better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel, better than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most movies I wait until they get out on DVD, for one I don't have to wait in line and I get to watch the movie from the comfort of my couch. However, ever so often a movie comes along that I want to see in the theater, this being the case with the Underworld sequel. When they first advertised Underworld Evolution, I decided that this was a movie I wanted to see in the theater. I enjoyed the first Underworld movie when it came out, it was a good movie with plenty of action, a decent storyline and some nice special effects.So needless to say I had certain expectations for the sequel. With this said, lets get on with the review already; Underworld - Evolution is one of few sequels that are better than the original. I really enjoyed the movie, and it managed to keep my attention throughout the length of the movie. Usually my eyes wanders during dull moments in a film, but this movie kept my eyes glued to the movie screen, I didn't even take a moment to look at the watch. As a sequel it also filled in several of the gaps left behind from the first movie.The movie starts up only minutes later from where the first movie ended, we find Selene and Michael in one of the many hideouts that the vampire clan has, where Selene wants to leave Michael and head in to awaken Marcus before Craven kills him. The story continues with a flashback to the time when the war against the Lycans (werewolves) started. Marcus had a twin brother William, who was the first lycan to walk the earth, who's only goal was to turn more people into Lykens. Marcus turned Victor in turn to get his help in capturing William and send him away to an eternal prison. After the flashback we get to see Craven being killed by Marcus who, if you saw the first movie, woke up by the blood of a lycan and thereby turned into a vampire-lycan hybrid.Without revealing the rest of the movie; this sets up the movie nicely, and from this point on it is non stop action where Selene and Michael nesting up the newfound secrets and mysteries from Selenes past in an attempt to stop Marcus from freeing his twin brother and thereby releasing him to the rest of humanity.Compared to the first one, the movie is bloodier, the action more intense and the fighting scenes more elaborate. They also managed to avoid scenes where the presence of computer generated images was blatantly visible. Another nice touch was the use of animatronics and real humans in most of the scenes where werewolves where present.Underworld is the kind of movie where mediocre acting is easily forgotten by me because of good action. With that said, I didn't see any obvious bad acting. The two main characters Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvinus (Scott Speedman) along with the rest of the acting crew deliver a good performance. And as an added plus for me anyway, we also get to see Selene in a love scene with the hybrid Michael.If you like movies with lots of action and special effect, I think you will enjoy this movie. I know that once it is released on DVD, it will become a part of my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new twist on old vampire story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put -- I love this movie. I love both movies.Cast, special effects, soundtrack all shine through.I hope there is a third! (Crossing fingers &amp; toes) And I hope it's good!Tony Curran's addition to the cast was a pleasant surprise. I have admired his work for a few years now. His portrayal of Marcus was chilling.Selene is kick-a**, and even more so in this installment where she gets even more fight scenes. Scott Speedman's character development is coming along nicely since the first film. If there is a third installment, I would like to see Michael break out even further -- be more than just "back-up" for Selene.Was the love scene necessary? No, but it was appreciated!I also like the way this film continues to explore the immortality issue, delving even further into history and expanding the coven lineage.Some people talk about how Underworld is an allegorical tale...of war? of the soul? Whatever others make of it, it's a new twist on vampire &amp; werewolf stories, and I always welcome that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a decent sequel to the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'Underworld Evolution' Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene, the vampire death dealer. But things have changed; she has learned the truth about the war between vampires and lycans. The hunter has become the hunted. While trying to protect Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a vampire/lycan hybrid; she must also prevent the sons of Corvinus from uniting against all mankind.This movie is a decent sequel to the original. Lots of action and cool effects. It is not as good as the first, but it does answer a lot of questions from the original. However, it poses more questions and is a bit confusing. I do not remember the first movie ever taking place in Romania. In the end you are lead to believe one thing, but Selene's epilogue leads you elsewhere. Guess there will be another sequel.As an added bonus, you almost see Kate Beckinsale down to her bare nothings. I can not believe she thinks she has a fat ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice effects, not so much plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie-makers are getting really good at making crazy things look real...werewolves crashing through car windows, etc. Because it's a movie, however, your belief is temporarily suspended anyway. You're not looking for cool effects, you're looking for interesting situations and cool effects to assist them.Situations here aren't so interesting. Plot isn't anything. Dialogue, while not nearly as poor as expected, wasn't interesting either. As far as a movie goes, I don't think the story and characters make it worth paying to view the effects.My comment...wasn't long enough. So I'll end with saying Kate Beckinsale could make for a decent action hero - British accent, good facial control for delivering that wry humor, looks like she could be an action hero. She needs a decent film...something medieval perhaps?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not what you expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I loved the original Underworld. However, I was slightly caught off balance with this move (not necessarily disappointed). This Movie is very pretty to watch. The fight scenes are fun and well made. It still has the same hauntingly dark atmosphere that sucks you in immediately. Unfortunately, do not go into this movie expecting the first movie's caliber. The plot is very weak with many points that aren't quite plot holes but they are cheap ways out. I don't want to spoil anything but there are a couple of random and unneeded scenes and people here and there. And the end might leave you thinking "What?", "That was Cheap", and "I saw that coming." You have to go into this movie ready to accept everything they throw at you no matter how ridiculous, and I'm not just talking about minor changes in character attributes (Speed for example) I did like that they used pieces of the old movie and picked up right where they left off. In the end this is a great movie for when you want some awesome violence, but not for much more. It is your typical sequel. I will probably eventually buy it when it comes out on DVD, because I am a devote Underworld follower, but I won't go out of my way to see this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think it would be much better than the first, even though the first one rocked my socks. But this one went above and beyond my expectations. Unbelievable can't even come close to how great this movie was. Great fight scenes, even better story, and a little of Kate's skin didn't hurt either.... "wink" "wink". Left it open for a possible third title. Easily one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I would've like to have seen MORE fight scenes though the ones there did just fine. We learn the story behind Selene's family and the truth behind her and Viktor's relationship. Only thing I didn't quite get was the reason behind putting Evolution in the title. Was it because Selene drank some of Corvinus' blood and shes the new breed? When I first saw the trailer I thought maybe the new breed would have been bats, but that's answered when we see that Markus can fly and that he was originally bit by a bat. Anyways, can't wait to see if there's gonna be a third. Patiently waiting for the day when I find out that vampires and Werewolves ARE real and then begging one to bite me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld Evolution or Why movies in which set designers who aspire to become directors shouldn't be allowed to cast their wives in a incoherent vampire s&amp;m sex fantasy flick and force other people to pay to see it.(oh, I forgot, It's a sequel)...Pay to see it again. Now down to the basics on a film level (never mind the screenplay(laughs UNCONTROLLABLY) why this film "ain't no good"1- Starts out with a scroll: Never a good sign 2- Has Voice Over Out Of Nowhere by our lead heroine: Worse Sign then- Direction: Confusing and inconsistent at best. Mode of operation seems to be: point camera at principles killing/kicking/biting/shooting each other with shutter speed on overdrive photography without thinking about establishing shots. Oh and when said director is confused, either resort to "stylistic" slo-mo shots of his "sweetie" showing how snow flakes highlight her hair or just rip off action sequences from other movies: Upon viewing I noticed lifts from "Lord Of The Rings", "Gladiator", "Mission Impossible", "Excalibur", "Dune", "Sudden Death" (cough), "Bad Boys II" (Cough Again) and yes obviously The Matrix.Editing: More confusing than the direction. Trying to go for a mix between The Matrix and Born Supremacy and Michael Bay but just ends up headache inducing. Flashback filter effects didn't help either. Now to be fair, once the plot (again laughs uncontrollably) gets going about an hour in, at least the action sequences seem more coherent. Plus the scenes with the eldest vampire and "tanis" (an vampire in exile) give off a "this is kinda interesting" vibe. Those scenes contain expository dialog up the you know what. but oddly they are the best scenes in the movie. Could be the acting though. And the obligatory sex scene ( remember...this is decent budget sex fantasy movie for the director and his "sweetie) shows some effective eroticism. (Points off for the love interest looking like Scott Stapp from "Creed") Course, Kate Beckinsale is an incredibly beautiful woman and looks great in tight back leather.Oh, and a good roster of British and European character actors provide good acting for this sort of thing. (Tanis and the eldest Vampire being the best) And all your effects junkies out there, the CGI work in most cases works beautifully.Despite some aspects working in it's favor, Underworld Evolution ultimately fails at trying to be a dense mythology movie. UE tries to emulate much better sci-fi horror fantasy films (Dark City immediately comes to mind). Movies like Dark City and The Matrix worked because those films knew how to throw you into a confusing "world" at the same time providing genuine surprising reveals which made most of the narrative lines come together into a coherent story. "Underworld Evolution" like "Underworld" continues to be a convoluted mess that ultimately ends up being confusing.And to top it of (spoiler ahead)The big reveal concerning and prison made for a uber werewolf and how the construction of the prison relates to the Beckensale's character just isn't that fascinating.Oh and a kind of neat end to an action sequence and the affect of a sun rise on a main character become marred by a moment that reminded me of a Calvin Klein "Obsession" Commerical. I was awaiting a voice over to say "Underworld Evolution for hybrid werewolf/vampire men"(spoilers end) 4 out of 10 Let's hope the Russian Film "Nightwatch" that has the same vibe as the "Underworld" films is as good at the trailer looks end kdc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You shouldn't watch this movie.....ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I have a lot of problems with this movie. First off I would have to be completely and utterly disgusted with this movies lack of originality. For various reasons. 1. Vampires in this movie have firearms?! WTF?!Vampires should be feared and should not wield firearms! I am sick of this entire new age/tech vampire crap that is being made these days.2. Blue. What is with all of the blue? I think if this movie hadn't been so blue,that it would have been that much more appealing. I mean, what is it with the pristine blue eyed vampires and werewolves? I could have walked into this movie and sworn I fell into the ocean. 3. Blinding Lights I am not going to lie, if you are watching this movie in the theater than you should wear yourself a pair of sunglasses. This movie has some of the most painful blinding white flashes I have ever encountered in a theater.4. Story/Plot Most of the time, this movie is pointless chatting and crappy special effects, that were making me yawn. The action scenes were also extremely unoriginal and I had seen nothing even remotely awe inspiring.I could elaborate more on how extremely craptastic this movie was. But doing so would be a waste of my time, and yours. So I bid you farewell, and hope that you don't watch this terrible waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a fan of the original Movie, in fact I own it, unfortunately, this one was a big let down.Essentially, this movie is from the first screen to the last screen nothing more than buckets of blood, gore, sex, nudity, and what else? Not much else. They seem to have forgotten to include the story. Interesting that the special effects are somewhat pathetic. The blood spattering for example is excessive to the point of being stupid. In several scenes I thought the blood looked like "claymation" or something to that effect.As for sexual content. Why? The first movie was fine without it... This one was filled with gratuitous nudity. Unnecessary.In summary, if you enjoyed the first movie, don't expect this one to be very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution is terrible.I'm a huge fan of the Underworld characters, especially Kate Beckinsale's hot kick-ass vampire chick, dressed in tight fitting black latex that neatly shows off her curves with the slightest hint of light and movement. The sets in the first one were pretty cool and I think they get a little better in the sequel. That's about all the positives for this film. What a shame.I was hoping it would score high on the fighting sequences, but it was pretty poor in that department. There are some neat shots, but most of it is pretty quick, hard to follow and uninteresting. There's a whole bunch of characters in this movie that weren't in the first, but they get killed off as quickly as they're introduced. As much as I want to see Kate Beckinsale in the costume that she wears in this movie, she's in every scene! If they just had a two hour slideshow of Kate Beckinsale stills I might have been less disappointed. At least that way I wouldn't have to try to follow one of the worst scripts ever written for this genre. There's more character development in children's stories.There's a hint at a third Underworld movie. My suggestion to the director would be to put the writers of this one in it and have them torn apart in a brutal and gruesome action scene. That and perhaps some Kate Beckinsale nudity might make me want to see a third installment.</fullReview>

Also, I was glad to hear the musical theme from the first back in the sequel.I was not pleased, however, with the story-line/plot nor the character development. There was nothing deep or compelling about Evolution. In essence, the movie was just one big hunt/chase with a bunch of filler material for plot holes and history. The tempo was rushed; everything about this movie was just one-dimensional, way too linear. There was no continuing development of the returning characters, nor was there any sort of development or deep significance for the new ones either. And I'm sure we were all waiting to see Michael's true (unique?) potential. Too bad none of it was there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld: Evolution is best described like a porno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say that, I mean that the film has small amounts of plot to drive the movie to the next action sequence as soon as possible. Underworld: Evolution starts off at a really good pace by using the very end of the first film as a starting point for this one. We're thrown into as though we've seen the first and for those who haven't, we get a glimpse of how the first film played out. The interesting thing is that we get a memory of Marcus, the very first Vampire, and how his brother was captured as our first scene to the film. The whole flash back scene is not just for the audience, but for Marcus to find out what's been going on while he's been asleep.That, to me, is the best sequence we could get out of the entire film. Other than that we get a line up of scenes as follows: Action/Violence, story, action, story, action/violence, story, sex, story, action/violence/sex, story, and so on. The parts that display the plot are so small that you know what is going to happen next with the film. Even the big secret of Scott Speedman's character is totally predictable. While watching the film both myself and a friend viewing the film with me could tell who was the next person to be killed in the film. The problem with this film (and also one of the parts I liked) is that it starts directly after the first film and tries way too hard to give more back-story than is needed with this type of film. If it wanted to stay in the past, it should have. If it wanted to stay with the story moving forward, it should have as well without a lot of un-needed plot gimmicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has lost its charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the first movie, but, much like the Matrix Reloaded, Underworld Evolution has taken a wonderful thriller and converted it into your adrenaline packed nonsense-fest. Don't get me wrong, if all you want to see is expensive CGI/animatronic beasts with superhuman powers pounding away at each other, you are in for a treat. But for those of us who loved the original for its highly stylized portrayal of vampires and lycans, it is a huge let down.The reason I enjoyed the first movie so much was plain and simple: lore and suspense. While the story was nothing mind-blowing, it was revealed in small chunks on a purely need to know basis, building both suspense and speculation. This movie has been far to commercialized.Here's what I think happened in an exec's office:EXEC1: Have we got the results from the focus group yet?EXEC2: Yes. Those who enjoyed the first movie said they would like to see more action, cool powers, badder monsters, and sex in the second. EXEC1: Let's give it to them!EXEC2: Won't that compromise the artistic integrity of the series? EXEC1: Who cares!? Focus groups don't lie.If you remember in the first, most of the key plot twists were very well built up to. In some sense, you would almost anticipate them, and when they finally happened it was a great sense of satisfaction and recognition. In the sequel, there is none of that; plot twists hit you square in the face, without any forewarning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst the first film was an unusual departure for Ms Beckinsdale, the second has become more of a narrative then a true exploration into the promised potential. After leaving the first film with wide open potential, here Wiseman and company have failed to truly explore the full range of development which was available in the sequel. Whilst a bigger budget does, indeed offer the blood thirsty exactly what they had hoped for in the form of more extreme stunts, effects and costumes. What it fails to deliver is a through exploration of each of it's characters potentials. While introducing all the expected back story, Wiseman seems to have forgotten to include genuine motivations and relationships. This feels more like a glossed over narrative of unhappy families, rather then the potentially involving, deeply dynamic relationships we might have seen. Final Summary: Promising, with a significant amount of potential commercially for a third in the series. What I hope for, will be a more character driven story, as with such classics as Bram Stoker, the potential is there, it's time Wiseman and company exploited it properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let me start off by saying that i was a very big fan of the original underworld and have seen it 10+ times. when the trailers came out for evolutions, i knew it was a must-see-in-theaters movie. the trailer looked great! i walked out of the theater on Saturday night with 5 other friends... and let's just say not even the beers that followed the movie were enough to wash out the bad taste this movie left in our mouths.the movie started out great and seemed to pick up right where the first movie left off. the movie did a good job at filling in on some history of vampires and lycans (werewolves). then, came a completely unnecessary and lengthy sex scene that became a turning point in the quality of the movie. from that scene on, everything went down hill... the plot, the character development, even the rules of how vampires and lycans can be killed were changed.the movie had great special effects and had it's moments, and the movie never really dragged, except for that sex scene (yes, it was that ridiculous... the whole theater was laughing through the whole scene). despite their attempts in filling in the plot, the audience is still left with a lot of confusion in the end, A LOT of things that occurred do not make any sense if you were to sit down to think about them. for example, where exactly does this movie take place? if you're looking for a blood, action, special effects filled movie, this is a must see. if you don't like movies with cheesy one-liners and unnecessary love scenes, you might want to think twice before seeing this in the theaters.yes, i will probably watch this once more only for the sake of better understanding the plot for underworld 3 (the ending is absolutely left open for the possibility of another sequel). but otherwise, i am VERY disappointed with this sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I was a big fan of the first movie, as it took a fresh new approach to the whole vampire/werewolf genre. I was extremely impressed with Beckinsale and the Lykens. When they annouced this movie was coming out, I was excited to see it. Walking out of the theatre, I could not help but feel it was not as good as the first. Yet, it is hard to tell why it fell short.I want to say that they spent too much time developing the relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman and did not give me the "wow" factor of action that hit me with the first movie. Markus was a decent villain, along with his brother, but they went out too quickly for my taste at the end. Furthermore, they did not elaborate on how Celine has changed due to incorporating Corvinus's blood into her own.Bottom line - I would have rated the first one in the high 7s, while this one is a low 6 in my book. A tad disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only wish this review wasn't at the back, and it would help people a lot more being up the front of the list! The movie is really disappointing!!! Firstly, it's not really a sequel, in fact, it's more like a continued ending of the first. All events take place within a day or two since the first ended.Where is this new race? What's going on with having an immortal forefather just give up the ghost and show nothing of his abilities? The story had so much potential, but lost out to SONY and the younger generation.Kate is awesome, and it's the only reason I am OK with the fact that I can not get that time back in my life.I would wait for DVD folks, it's just not worth it, and I love the genre, and really tried to like it.. but, it's just bad..We need story line, not just gore and a few silly fights with puppy dogs, and people who have colours eye lenses without fangs! What's going on here!!! Oh, that's right, end part 1 with a part 2, and leave it open for a part 3 ? now we have a baby, conceived in a vampire, fathered by a cross breed vampire/werewolf, and will mature in a vampire, with rejuvenated blood from the forefather, who was immortal.. will that spawn the anti-Christ!? Possibly! BTW ? The idea of drinking from other vamps and not being able to eat food (why did they show that scene?), seems to be inherited from Anne Rice's series..Must I write a new series on the genre to get my own quality entertainment! Very sad about Underworld Evolution folks!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Evolution reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2 out of 4Underworld: Evolution is a waste of creative potential; a swarthy letdown of picture. The whole series needs to take two steps back, realize what they've wasted and, with the inevitable third film, slice and bite their way down a new direction. It has all the right puzzle pieces, but lacks a clue as to where to place them. So, like its predecessor, co-writer/director Len Wiseman throws these metaphoric puzzle pieces about, and lets them fall into an awkward, nonsensical form. What we're given is a test of our patience; a humorless, stomping march through grudgingly forced territory. Instead of fixing what was broken with the first Underworld, Wiseman lazily lets the flaws stand, flaunting their arrogant blemish throughout this unnecessary sequel. To explain the plot would be pointless. In short, it's a stupid, incestuous mess of broken legends and weakly imagined backstory. It's confusing, rife with peripheral characters, and greatly lacking necessity. Wiseman and Co-writer Danny McBride form this farce of a history lesson involving the warring clans, the Lycans and the Death Dealers (which is Underworld jargon for Werewolves and Vampires). Skipping all the nonsense of Underworld: Evolution's exposition, a hybrid of the two clans, Lord Marcus (Tony Curran) rises from slumber to wreak devastation. Our porcelain-skin, leather-clad Vampire heroine, Selene, played be the wickedly bewitching gem Kate Beckinsale, is forced to mount the offensive with her friend (also a hybrid) Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).The many legends of vampires are almost always ones of great and boundless indulgence. They delve into deep sensuality and pointy-toothed violence, forming a Gothic excess of elements fearfully enjoyable in all their guilty pleasures. The Underworld series would do better to leave their quasi-medieval backstories behind and indulge in the slick, sensually Gothic overtones it already dabbles in. What might form would be a stylish urban fantasy; a devilish merging of legends that would fall somewhere between The Matrix and a Stephen Sommers flick (The Mummy, Van Helsing). But we mustn't forget humor. As it stands, Selene is a hard-edged badass awkwardly capable of romance. What she needs?and what all the other characters need for that matter?is a hearty does of wry, tongue-in-cheek humor a la Hellboy. The film is depressingly humorless. With B-level superhero material such as this, a pinch of the funny spice is certainly called for. Fortunately however, Wiseman doesn't skimp with his action sequences. Running rampant through nearly every scene of his film, Wiseman's violence is low on inspiration, but brimming with fury. This is no PG-13 tricycle tour of tamed melee combat. No. Wiseman allows spacious screen time for his highly stylized scenes of gore and fortunate violence to stretch their limbs and rear their heads. And with a tastefully explicit sex scene of Beckinsale and Speedman, Len Wiseman assuredly knows how to do rated-R right. But with only the directorial experience of both Underworld features?both of which are room temp. duds?maybe its Wiseman's time to go buff up his directorial skills on a different project and let another filmmaker drive the next Underworld vehicle. The Underworld universe is certainly capable of lavish offerings, with its steely blue-eyed bloodsuckers and the indelibly voluptuous Selene. And with such a taste for high-octane violence, and werewolves straight out of F.W. Murnau's wildest dreams (Nosferatu), Underworld could flaunt the potential of becoming a devastatingly successful hybrid of cinema if it simply had the mind to change. -reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it just me or did she miss every shot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? I really liked this movie. And to be honest, I didn't like the first one. And I realized why on my way out of the theater. So let's break it down.Underworld was a modern-day vampire flick. What I thought was so stupid, was the fact that the werewolves (or should I say "Lycans") and vamps would use guns... And the one thing that totally ruined the movie for me, is that it took place in a sprawling city. I mean c'mon, how believable is that? Like people wouldn't notice the increasing deaths of humans who have been beastly attacked or bitten? It wasn't all-that believable. Otherwise, the story wasn't bad, it was decent, and Scott Speedman looks like a surfer.Now in Underworld: Evolution, things change up a bit. Sadly I missed the first 20 mins (I actually work at the movie theater and didn't get off till 20 min. later), but I got the gist of things as soon as I sat down and started watching from "Marcus-attacks-the-truck" scene. That scene, in fact, was kind of decent. A little on the dull side, is the fact that everyone gets shot in the face 235948 times and don't have any scars to show for it. But then again, vampires and werewolves are in this movie also. The story in this movie isn't any better than it's predecessor. Not a bad thing, just not a good one. Now here's the thing I liked about this movie: It's setting. The one reason the prequel was so dis-likable (in my eyes) was it's locales. But in this one, it takes place out in the mountains and on and island and a ship. That's much more believable since not too many people would notice these places and it sorta brought back the whole Gothic-style, early centuries vampires.Then of course there was the inevitable love scene between Kate &amp; Scott (who still looks like a surfer when not in "hybrid-form"). But I must admit, it was very well done and mature. And Christ, Kate Beckinsale had such a beautiful body. And uh, Scott Speedman has a surfer butt I guess (j/k). So eventually things boil-down the hot and heavy session known as The Final Battle. I don't wanna spoil anything, but OH MY LORD it was perfect. Whoever thought of it should be blessed. So if you like action movies, despite some mild cheesiness, you should catch this one while it's still in theaters.Oh yeah, the title of this review is due-to-the-fact that it seems Kate's character, Selene, misses every shot since all she ever hits are rocks and walls and her enemies seem the least bit hurt when she fires. And I guess the ending sort of left it open for another sequel, in a way. I wouldn't mind that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now before I invoke the wrath of the great and the good, I would like to clarify that, as stated in prior entries, this is an excellent film for fans of the first film, and for the genre as a whole. It gently probes past elements of many of the characters history, filling them out from the otherwise two dimensional highly entertaining figurines that they were. It has sharp editing, an excellent director of photography, and it does exactly what it says on the tin. But. It could have been so much better. It falls foul of The Sequel Rule, it is forced to spend so much time explaining all the elements of the first film that a lot of plot lines that could have been detailed are passed over in a far too rudimentary manner. There is far too much relying upon flashback and voice-over, both of which are sure fire pointers to a poorly handled plot. The guns, the leather, the extensive use of contact lenses, the assumption that the viewer has a brain, all the successes of the original are here. Watch it, you'll love it, and you will be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first movie, bought it on DVD. I would not buy this movie. There was no character buildup, they kept throwing new characters at you and quickly giving you background info on them. I didn't care about anyone in the movie. I feel that the first one was an intelligent vampire movie. The second did have good special effects, but the fight scenes weren't as good. Everyone keeps saying don't watch it unless you were a fan of the first. Well, I am, but I could have missed this movie.**Spoilers follow**For instance, they introduce the old man and one thinks he's a bad guy. But then we find out that he's the father and he has been cleaning up the mess of the vampires. And from the first scene, one would think that Marcus is a good guy, taking up for his brother and all that. But he's a major bad guy. From blood memory of the others, he should be able to see that werewolves have evolved and he might could actually "save" his brother with science. But noooo, he just wants to set him free. Oh well, I just think it had some inconsistencies and could have been a much better movie and didn't meet the standards of the first one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie held up to my expectations quite nicely. That said, you still have to expect a little typical vampire/werewolf movie "cheese". But compared to all others of the genre, this is definitely on top of the list.The movie completes the mythology that was touched upon in the first installment. I've very happy that most if not all characters/actors from the first movie came back to paint a much deeper background story for Celine.I'm sure some will say that it lacks a certain thrill/suspense of the first one, but since the action scenes are a little more tasteful this time around, hopefully it won't diminish your hunger for good old action scenes. On a semi-technical note, I'm glad the director didn't follow the popular trend with a lot of slow motion fight scenes because in my opinion they are really well done.I kind of wish they would stop there because it would be a shame to go for a trilogy with a bad third movie. But, you a get a sense that such a third film would have to go the way of tragedy to be at all successful, such as a play from Shakespeare we all know.A definite must see in theaters for fans of the genre, and a good cheap night treat for the casual moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically brilliant, but still missing the most important ingredient: captivating writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Len Wiseman, apparently, is a fine fine director, particularly when it comes to perfecting the technical and visual aspects of film-making, and for that, I still enjoy "looking at" his Underworld movies.Sure he's shown some improvement from the previous installment. He's backed off of some of the horrid clichés of Gothic culture and concentrated more on being serious about the characters and their world. The hard goth rock music is gone now, and the matrix-like shots are toned back to reality, making the film feel less gimmicky. The vampires are no longer sitting around sipping wine and smoking in a mansion for no apparent reason. The irritating and corny character of Craven is not in the movie for long. Tony Curran's design, although not groundbreaking, provides us with something new to look at for those of us not involved in the story. These are good improvements.However, the biggest problem with the first film was not these things, and it continues right into the second one without wavering. It was the story and its structure. It was the screenplay. It was the writing itself. The problem with the writing is that it does not get the virgin audience involved in what is going on. There are too many names to memorize. Too much back-story to keep up with. All the characters, including the protagonist know way more than we do, even after the inciting incident. We don't care what she wants to learn. The mystery is meaningless to us, in the same way a mechanic would try to get a soccer mom interested in knowing what exactly is causing her carburetor to fail. It's over our head. All the characters are dead serious, have no complexity, and are one dimensional. They're all immortal, important and dangerous. That's all they seem to be, and that's all they are. The main character has issues about loyalty, but we feel nothing. We just don't care where it's going. We don't want to know what happens next. We have no burning questions in the back of our mind, except "how long is this movie, again?".In "Hellboy", we have this character who is a powerful demon from hell who is of great biblical significance to the entire universe, but how does he act? Does he act like a pompous Shakespearian actor in a goth club, like every single character in the Underworld movies? No, he acts like Bruce Campbell, puffing on a cigar, while having a soft-spot for cats. Which character would we rather watch? The one who plays the opposite to his stereotype. (Bear in mind, Hellboy isn't a completely unique character. We've seen this kind of juxtaposition in Army of Darkness and Big Trouble in Little China, so just using that idea as is will just be another cliché, but it's a step in the right direction.)I think Wiseman is salvageable as a great director, and I think McBride and his fellow writers have some great ideas and concepts, but they really need to learn how to get the audience to care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who are MAJOR Underworld fans you will not be disappointed by this sequel. Though not as extensive as Underworld 1 it gives the same hardcore characters and amazing settings. There will be one or two shocks for those of you who haven't seen it yet. And there will be some disappointment for some things, but it is all forgiven by the end. Len Wisemen has once again given a beautiful masterpiece. The audience learns even more about Selene's past and it gives her more a emotional side compared to the warrior that she plays in the first. Micheal also gets to show his own warrior side, given that he has become the perfect immortal. I will say that the lycan effects are not as great as they were in the first. They modified the hybrid and lycan look, which makes them look slightly LESS realistic, but that is to be expected since they probably cut out some things in the first for their smaller budget. (not sure about that..but it would seem that they were given a bigger budget this time). This definitely deserves at least 3.5/4 stars, compared to the 1/4 given by a yahoo critic.</fullReview>

I really thought the first Underworld had a great story line but the second was complicated and did not need to be. I think the writers had this fantastic winged creature and tried to build the story around it. They kept adding and adding until the whole thing came out a mess! Vampires and werewolves is enough. You don't need to complicate things with a bunch of hard to follow, complex, misunderstood, hanging by a thread story. Had it not been for the effects I would have given this a 1.

		<shortDescription>Everything I hoped it would be--and more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Len Wiseman managed to surpass the effort of the first Underworld movie by giving us Evolution, a movie which depicts the battle that Selene and Michael Corvin fight to keep the last Vampire Elder, Marcus, from unleashing his brother William and initiating his own brand of Death Dealer/Lycan hybrid: one that basically ruthlessly destroys anything that gets in the way. In one respect, the movie appears to buy into the belief that more gore is better, which is something that I typically steer away from, but in this case I feel that the gore was not excessive. Honestly, I don't know how else Wiseman could have depicted the type of sheer animal brutality that Marcus holds within him. In a sense, this is what allows us to look at Selene and Michael and even Corvinus himself for their humanity.I was completely captivated by the plot. I suppose if there was one thing that I especially enjoyed it was the revelations surrounding Selene's importance to the resolution of the story. The acting was good, the creature effects were just plain awesome, and the only drawback for me was the unnecessary skin/sex scenes. Yes, I do believe that they could have minimized the one scene between the two lovers and still conveyed the basic idea just as well. As for the other scene with the historian dude (can't remember his name), it did nothing for the plot.This movie and this franchise have really impressed me. I can't wait to go out and buy this movie, and I hope for the addition of a third one sometime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is possibly the worst movie since Doom 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got around to see this movie, and I've gotta say that it is a let down. The entire film consists of three type of characters, the main characters, the explainers, and of course, the cannon fodder.The main characters are of course Selene played by Beckinsale, and Michael played by Speedman. You might ask, "do any other main characters from the original return?". Well yes and no, they all became "explainers"; which means they show up to explain something (usually telling us why the bad vampire is bad, which is kinda bloody obvious, no pun intended) then gets killed.The last type of characters is of course, the self-explanatory cannon fodder. They are basically there to get killed, and lots and lots of people get killed. In fact, if they're not named "Selene" or "Michael", they'll most likely be killed. If you played a drinking game where you took a shot every time somebody got killed, you'll be sufficiently drunk by the first 5 minutes and be spared the rest of the movie.Speaking of the rest of the movie, it's one clip show after the other; the basic structure of the movie consists of the following: clip show &gt; killing &gt; clip show &gt; more killing &gt; explosion &gt; explainer explains &gt; killing of explainer &gt; clip show &gt; killing of some random folks &gt; lousy sex scene &gt; killing &gt; killing &gt; killing of the final boss. The story is only there to excuse the next killing or explosion, but never quite delve into the characters or their reasons. And most of these plots were told by the clip shows or flashbacks, which are mostly from the first movie.You might have noticed the "lousy sex scene" there, which is exactly accurate. First of all there is no nudity from Beckinsale, which is more than disappointing. Second of all considering the position of her partner relative to herself, one can come to the only conclusion that either Michael has no idea whatsoever how to have sex, or his "transformations" have somehow transplanted his penis onto his knee.If you're one who needs only gore in a movie, this will possibly be somewhat enjoyable. However I felt the whole thing is just an excuse at stealing money out of people's pockets. There is literally no story (again, CLIP SHOW!!!) and no characterization (they're either busy killing or be killed). This is possibly the worst movie since Doom 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good popcorn flick but nothing to really hype up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld is a very interesting cinematic phenomenon. The two movies essentially are enjoyable provided that you shut off your intellectual faculties. However, upon closer inspection it's very obvious that the movies have taken a lot from White Wolf studios, a successful role playing company whose games Vampire: the Masquerade and Werewolf: the Apocalypse form the basis of their World of Darkness franchise. The games feature an opportunity for gamers to play sympathetic, humanized monsters struggling to maintain their humanity. In the story plot for the World of Darkness series, werewolves and vampires are immortal enemies. It comes as no surprise to me that the entire conflict between the two antagonist in the movie seems ripped right out of the pages of White Wolf's role playing guides.I found the plot of the movie conceited. To say that these two monsters spent the past milling fighting over the fate of mankind, using fear and violence as their tactics, must now hide their monstrous existence is inconceivable. As is the idea of the creation of a superior race, which smacks of Hitlerian dogma, something that has become standard fare in sci-fi, comic books and every farce of the evil scientist. Further, the writers need to explain how science has advanced to the point where Vampires can harness the powers of the sun into a single round and use it to kill other Vampires.Action-wise there is nothing new in Underworld 2 that a viewer hasn't already seen in an action flick since the premier of the first Matrix film. In fact, the fight scenes were not filmed very well and the choreography came off very slow and lacking in fluidness. The gun play had a lot of generic qualities since Hollywood started aping Asian cinema. Speaking of guns, one of my main complaints in the film is the need for Vampires to wield any weapon at all, seeing how they are supernatural. If the viewer is to take these monsters seriously as threats, then the need for them to arm themselves against humans and Werewolves only makes them appear even more weaker and pathetic. One of the biggest disappointments in the film is the lack of powers associated with the undead.Another problem with the vampires in the movie is that they are too humanized to the degree that there is no monstrous quality to them. In order to have them serve as a protagonist it is necessary for them to have "a" quality that the audience can relate too. But overall I found them a little too human to the degree that the audience at times forgets that the heroine is a vampire. Indeed the Vampires were nothing more than super-powered humans with fangs and a fear of the sun. At no point did any of the principle vampires in the film succumb to their lust for human blood. Nor was there any driving conflict between their dark, blood driven hunger and this "human" quality of theirs.There is not much of a truly Gothic feel in this movie. Pale-skinned women clad in tight pleather wearing their hair black is not Gothic. I think folks need to read Poe, LeFanu, or Blackwood so they can understand the elements of horror a little better. The main characters are more stock and token caricatures of the genre. To sum, this movie is all flash and glitz, packing little in the way of substance. If this movie seems appealing it is only because the target audience have built this movie up in their heads. This movie definitely will not make the top ten vampire or werewolf films of all time.</fullReview>

In Underworld, the plot seemed to race a little bit faster, and have a twisting and turning, and less predictable pace. In Underworld: Evolution, the setup seems very basic, the characters' roles are easy to decipher, and there also seemed to be some things that were just thrown in without a purpose for this movie, granted that some of those things that were thrown in will have a purpose when the studio decides to make a third installment. Other than the points listed above, its always great to watch a strikingly beautiful girl in black leather garb kill giant scary monsters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened to the dark, mysterious underworld? What happened to the seductive yet frightening, tough yet feminine Selene? It's all missing, everything that made the first movie so original and entertaining has been lost in the time it took to write and make this sequel. Sadly. Gone even before Selene sheds her leather outfit to have a less-than-memorable love scene with Michael Corvin. Who came up with that meaningless tangent, which should have been implied rather than exposed? Takes away from the stylized darkness of the film.All in all, a sequel was something I wanted made but got one that simply did not live up to the legacy of the original movie. Sure, we get a lot of gore, leather and blue contact lenses, a couple of suspenseful moments ... but it all feels empty. No memorable characters. No memorable sets. No memorable weapons or evil laboratories. Sadly.Then, just toward the end, as Selene drinks some blood from Corvinus Sr., we hold our breath, hoping she will become the "future," as implied by Alexander himself. However, all we get is an angrier, more powerful vampire but no cool special powers. No evolution. She doesn't even grow those spiky wings! I feel totally cheated.I suggest watching the movie, venting a little, and then screening the original Underworld for some consolation, hoping that if there will be another Beckinsale-Wiseman episode, it will recapture the spirit of number one. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to see such high rating for such lowly piece of movie.Let alone the facts that you get hardly anything portrayed from this vampire world and what little you get is one stereotype after another...But honestly you need to decide if the following matters for you when choosing a movie to watch: - stupid speeches in the middle of a fight scene, - out of nowhere and sloppily performed travesty for a sex scene, - ridiculous "I'm your father, you're my son" reasoning to fill the holes in the script, - zero character development; in fact hollow characters altogether, - straightforward reminder flashes for the dim-witted.I believe that where the first movie barely succeeded in terms of a plot, this linear sequel fails completely. Don't expect any surprises, everything is laid before you like a paved road in the desert. But do expect components I have mentioned above.I would also like to say that there is a complex and thrilling world where vampires walk the Earth and I would love to see some movie based on that since vampires get more and more attention in media in the last years. It's called World of Darkness or Vampire:the Masquerade and I'm sure some of you know the books or pen-and-paper RPG games or a card game or even computer games based on this setup. Most notable piece of perfectly executed vampire story is the latest computer game from World of Darkness named Bloodlines. The plot is as thick as a pitch and the dialogues are just polished and rich (I produced a rhyme by accident :). Comparing Bloodlines to U:Evolution I can only laugh how weak this movie is. Truly a junk food for the masses powdered with flashy eye candy.I do not recommend this movie to anyone, not even the vampire fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the series, I apologize, but I went into the movie having seen the previous one but having no expectations other than, "eh, nothing else going on tonight..." That being said: I thought it was pretty bad.I dunno, the first one was a spot of cheese itself, but this one took the cake. Like they had armour circa 1200 AD or something like that...except it was designed like there were freakin' elves working on the stuff - pretty, fantasy design, completely impractical. Or the fact that the "sex scene" everyone seems so excited about, I guess they decided there was no where else to stick it in (no pun intended, kiddos), so they found a random spot in the movie to say, "hey, let's go to it." Considering at the time, they were still "on the run" from something, it seemed a tad contrived. And those stupid contacts? Or the way...no...no, I'm going to actively stop. It's a good "background" movie to be playing while you're doing something else...like not paying attention to it.Oh, and Bill Nighy, the guy who played the dad in Shaun of the Dead, he's the ex-head of the vampires, and wow, what a stinker - he acts as his zombie self (don't say that! say what? the zed word...) in Shaun of the Dead, except trying to deliver lines. Dreadful. And when the lycans turn, it's like something out of those old school claymation monster movies.Notice I'm being nice and not even going after the actual story line which at times seems to ask for a complete suspension of common sense. Not only do they break the "Show, Don't Tell" policy on many occasions, but in other aspects, they seem to completely blow off otherwise very important information, assuming (I assume) that the audience will quickly forget and move on if they have some big explosion or maybe a cleverly bewildering boob shot...wait, what was I talking about? Now see, I tried to stop...and it just...it upsets me more and more when I think about it. If you're just craving something generic with vampires and werewolves, um, here's your movie. I'm going to go sulk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible--a big disappointment that's a pointless nonstop show of gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I'm a reviewer who a) absolutely loved the first Underworld movie but b) still thinks that this one is terrible. I mean, I was looking forward to this movie with much anticipation and excitement--but from the opening clay-mation-like battle scene(that's how bad and fakey the special effects were in that part), to the end, there was pretty much just violence, violence, blood, and gore (with a little sex in between) with nary a plot to sustain it. While it may not be gratuitous in sex scenes, it most definitely is in violence--impalement is the operative word of the movie, it pretty much happens to everyone in a bloody fiesta and spectacle of guts and gore. Basically the movie consists of Selene and Michael running from Marcus in the Czech republic (how on earth did they end up there anyway?) and shooting at him. Over and over and over again. And then shooting at anything else in their way, to almost no effect (I wonder why they kept doing it--I guess just to keep up the standby of pointless blood and gore and violence). In the middle, they meet a vamp historian who tells them the truth of why Selene's family was targeted (finally some interesting plot! And the exposition promised by advertisers!), and then they meet Alexander Corvinus, the father of the Vamp and Lycan races. Then they go to stop Marcus from unlocking his bro the first Lycan using Selene's memory,and manage to chop Marcus's head off with a helicopter blade--thus they win for the time being, and set up for a third movie a la Matrix (though I have to say that the Matrix was a lot more plot-filled than this one, and less of a nonstop aimless gore fest.What I loved about the first movie was the ambiance, the the plot, with Selene trying to uncover Kraven's betrayal and save Michael--I liked seeing the way the vampires lived, with Selene's friend (played by Sophia Myles), the ceremonies of Awakening, the many vamps lounging glamorously in the Mansion. These are the things that I miss so much in this film, which weren't there--they only go to the mansion once, and that's just to see Marcus kill everyone and wipe out the Kraven threat in two seconds. We don't even get to see the rest of the vampire or Lycan clans even ONCE, besides the few who were with Kraven in the one "Marcus-killing-all" scene. And I think there's more violence than dialogue. True, there was violence in the first film--particularly the subway station scene in the beginning--but no where NEAR to the scale that exists in this movie. In this movie, the violence just takes over and overwhelms and swallows the plot, making it a journey from point A to B with mostly just violence and gore, a sex scene consummating Michael and Selene's love, a tiny bit of interesting exposition, and a tiny bit accomplished in the end. I hope the third will be better, but I won't get my hopes up too much this time, and will probably wait for it to come out on DVD to see it.But if you just like nonstop, pointless blood and gore and violence, then sure, maybe this movie is for you. For me, though, I like plot, and so I'll stick to the first Underworld film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>gave the first movie an 'A'. I thought it was slick, very stylistic, and as well acted as that type of movie could be.Underworld II was at the other end of the pole. The story was disjointed, full of holes, and too expansive for the time allotted on screen. The key to a good story is to make the unbelievable seem believable. This story was just too hokey for me. Characters did things that made no sense and they were driven by little more than the will to kill each other.The acting was weak. It's OK to have average acting in a movie like this, but at least put some effort into it. It seems, and I certainly wouldn't doubt, that the major roles were shot in a couple days. That is sad.It's hard to say anything about the direction, when the rest of the movie was so weak. I'm not sure what the director could do, with a grade F script, to turn it into a stellar film. I noticed Kevin Grevioux wasn't a real part of the script writing this time around. I can't say or not whether this is why the script was bad compared to the previous movie. Maybe he can write the 3rd installment and prove himself. Unfortunately I highly doubt Beckinsale will agree to a third movie without some major compensation.The visuals are what you would expect from this type of movie. It was more frenetic though than the first. While it was a dark film visually, the true Gothic feel seemed to be missing. I would have liked it to have slowed down a bit. Also the costumes were absolutely horrid.The good thing about this film was the action. If you like pure action with little plot and dialogue to get in the way, then you picked the right movie. While the fight scenes are not overly intricate, there is lots of gore and explosions.Overall it's one of the biggest negative turnarounds from one installment to the next that I can remember from recent memory. I would say probably the degradation of the Matrix films from one to the next come close. Sometimes it pays to stick to what works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes bigger than what the shotgun left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a preview screening of U:E. It was entertaining enough. A few good fights, but nothing spectacular. An awkward PG sex scene, but nothing spectacular. Good acting, but nothing... well, you get the point.The movie was a bit of a disappointment. Without spoilerafying it, let's just say that the plot didn't make any sense. It picks up where the first movie left off, but then takes a nintey degree turn and heads straight towards WTF-Ville. The plot quickly shoots to hell the entire timeline established in the first movie, then proceeds to shoot to hell the timeline IT establishes in the first five minutes of the movie. Just pay attention to how long ago the opening scene claims to be, and then pay attention to how old Seline is. Then think about it for a bit.The movie then goes on to pretty much completely ignore everything else the first movie set up. Everything from the hierarchy of vampires (Council? What Council?) to that whole "one elder sleeps, one elder rules" thing.The plot of the movie continues to contradict itself, sometimes extremely blatantly. It uses constant flashbacks to the first movie, and to the first half of itself, just so no one forgets what's going on. I really wish the writer had tried to remember. It would have made for a more enjoyable movie.So, in the end, a rather ordinary movie. Some fighting, some blood, and a lot of indestructible leather. See it if you must, but try to see it on a cheapy day.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first film as light entertainment and expected no more from the second. My low expectations weren't low enough. This sequel is a mess, mostly due to horrible writing. The story is full of cliché. The world and characters simply don't hold together in any sort of internal logic, and thus I lost interest in them as the film wore on. And it did wear on... me. The creature effects and cinematography were well done for the most part, though there are some obvious compositing glitches in the larger sets. The gory violence was actually the high- point of the film.Not scary. Not exciting. Not interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...what happened???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so the first underworld contained a strong plot, action, and the classic romeo and Juliet star crossed lovers. The second Underworld portrays none of the previous elements and is a gory mixture of gratuitous use of blood and random and unnecessary pornographic scenes. the class in which the first movie was developed seems to have given way to the classical shoot 'em up bloody and oversexed typical violent vampire movie. Some elements were very well carried out such as explaining the relationship between Selene and Victor, but having Markus turn into more than just a vampire from lycan blood from the first movie only resulted in a bat like creature instead of normal vampyric appearance. the random addition of the founder of the Corvus clan is random but adds a delightful twist at the end of the movie. color plays a much bigger role in the sequel and Michael is a side kick w/ about 4 lines in the entire movie... over all it was a disappointment considering the potential of the sequel. an OK movie but no where near the first underworld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend you watch the original Underworld before jumping into the sequel. I find that Evolution did not explain the original story as well as you would find if you watched the first movie from beginning to end. It's simply because Underworld, like the Matrix sequels, pick up right where the original left off. With that said, Evolution is excellent. Like a true sequel, it has more guns, more sexuality, more gore, more of everything really. But the best part of Evolution, is we have a story here that is flesh and blood and can complete the original. Wiseman did an excellent job keeping the original cast, to finish off a story where we, as movie viewers of the first, deserved to see a better ending.The final living elder, and the first vampire, Markus seeks his incarcerated twin brother William, who was the first werewolf, with Selene and Michael doing all they can to stop him.Aside from a steamy sex scene, I found Evolution continues a campy comedic route that was left from the first. The film is far more entertaining than the original. And, as a fan of continuity, I was much pleased to see the two Underworld stories put together nicely. If you loved the first, you will not be disappointed by its sequel. The climactic end battle is enjoyably worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stellar sequel...the series keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the recipe for a great sequel is double the action, double the gore, double the sex then Underworld Evolution nailed it home!! What Underworld began with being the only unique Vampire/Werewolf film it continues with Evolution. Rather than rehashing the original storyline in any way, Evolution picks up the back story behind some of the elder characters from the original. In fact Evolution creates nearly an entire new storyline from the original. I'm not sure that all the facts and plot points match to the original film but I can't say for sure so I won't nit pick that. Len Wiseman picks up the helm of co-writer and director once again and flawlessly pieces together an incredible sequel.Kate Beckinsale takes up the lead role of Selene again. This time Selene has even more of a bite to her. The character seems more rounded like Beckinsale has really come into the role and it's even better than before. She's dark and deadly!! She still creates one of the best action heroes in film history!! Scott Speedman returns as Michael Corvin, Selene's love interest and the only vampire/werewolf hybrid in existence. Both of them are on the run following Selene's murder of Viktor, the vampire Elder. She desperately needs someone to believe her about Viktor's part in starting and continuing the feud between them. The story definitely focuses more on Speedman's character than the original did which in some ways is unfortunate because Speedman is not as good as the rest of the cast. He's adequate and the chemistry between him and Beckinsale is okay but to rely the entire story on him is a big movie. All the original cast members return either in the story or in flashbacks going back to the ancient origins of their species. Tony Curran takes the role of Vampire elder meant to rule Marcus who is more powerful than imaginable after being awakened. All he desires to do is free his brother who is a Lycan from eternal imprisonment. Although Curran is buried under make up for the film he is still a kick-butt bad guy and seemingly unstoppable. Veteran character actor Derek Jacobi takes the role of Corvinus, the father of Marcus and his brother. He's not in the film much but he does well in the role as he tries to help Selene contain his sons.The story is far more intense than the original and slightly easier to follow although I promise you you'll enjoy the sequel 100 times more if you've seen the original immediately beforehand. The two films definitely meld together the story. It's a very complex plot for an action film and you must watch and follow closely. The romance heats up ten fold between Speedman and Beckinsale culminating with a rather steamy sex scene (I hope Wiseman took that day off when his wife was shooting the scene!) The action is beefed up with some incredible stunts and much more hand to hand combat than gun play like the original. And the gore...well the original had no hint of being a horror flick but the gore is quadrupled from the original. There is some really gut wrenching, blood soaked moments that are pretty damn cool!! If you saw the original you absolutely must continue and see the sequel because this is one second part that is even better than the original. Continue this franchise for the love of films!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought of the new #1 box office hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie a black screen rolls over and it explains in a few short words what happened in the first and where the second is going. Next takes a step back to develop some background story. Then instant action. The movie is left holding you with a tight grip around your neck as it were wondering where your going next and how the characters are going to get through everything that comes. I really enjoyed the movie. It has countless shots that are from the first movie that they re-shot and it still looks flawless. Almost every character (excluding Erika, Raze and Soren) return for the movie which I was also very glad to see. The movie just riveted off the screen and pulled you once again into the Underworld that I fell in love with in the first one. Kate Beckinsale does fantastic again. Everything in the movie has taken a step up from the gore which raised significantly to the love relationship between Selene and Michael to the history. It also explains so much that you were left wondering about the first one, like the necklace for instance. All of the fighting scenes were flawless and the soundtrack is great. There was no part of that movie were I could let my eyes off the screen it's the movie version of a book that you just can't put down. The plot makes sense, tasks are interesting, new characters introduced, and the movie is watcher friendly it makes sense. The stunts are a little better than the first which I thought were brilliant, and of course her awesome eyes are back. I didn't see a point of the movie that in anyway was less than I expected and I went to see it three times in one week and was just as excited to see it the third time as I was the first which is why I gave this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're at all interested in vampires, werewolves (also known as lycans in "Underworld"), then this and it's preceding film are great to see. There have been so many movies about vampires, werewolves, and demons, but none could provide the feeling of having your heart torn out in a good way until now. Kate Beckinsale (Selene) and Scott Speedman (Michael) are great together throughout both "Underworld" and "Underworld: Evolution." They play out roles of different kinds of supposed evil in an attempt to stop the war that was started long before their times. What grows between them is one of the best stories of love that I've witnessed in a film that wasn't considered cute, like "13 Going On 30", or tragic as in "Romeo &amp; Juliet". This love is and was breathtaking, in my opinion. Well, I'm done rambling. See both "Underworld" and "Underworld: Evolution" if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually appealing, but poorly directed (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Mild Spoilers ***First off, I'm a fan of the first movie which I found original and gripping. It was a frenetic ride that didn't let up until the last scene. Underworld: Evolution, however, does not live up to the high standard set by its predecessor.It was beautiful to watch and action-packed -- it was just very poorly directed. Lets face it, any move that needs a bunch of scrolling text, a voice-over narrative, AND a flashback in the first five minutes in order to set the stage needs some serious story work. Even with this setup, the movie never really hits its stride. There's an annoying amount of redundant exposition and a distracting profusion of flashbacks from the first movie. That wouldn't be so bad, but by about 15 minutes in I WAS WISHING I WAS WATCHING THE FIRST MOVIE -- the flashbacks just seemed to rub it in.Don't get me wrong, K Beckinsale is truly a wonder to behold in her skin-tight latex outfit. Too bad the director couldn't figure out a way of showing us her rear during every minute of every scene -- at least then I'd have had something to keep my mind (ahem) occupied.To wrap up here's a comparison of the two films:1. Kick ass fight scenes between scruffy werewolves and moody vampires? Underworld(Y) Underworld:E(N)2. Hotter-than-molten-lava K Beckinsale on continuous display? Underworld(Y) Underworld:E(Y)3. Irritating wussburger "hybrid" lycan-vampires running all over the place? Underworld(N) Underworld:E(Y)4. Dumb-as-a-stick male lead that gets his s#!t ruined repeatedly despite his immense powers? Underworld(Y) Underworld:E(Y)This one is definitely a rental.</fullReview>

The ones that asks you "Would you have enjoyed this movie with vampires?"With NO regards to the artistic value or creativity.The title "Evolution" has no meaning.Sound engineering was horrible. Just there to blow your ears.Excess use of poorly made flashback. It would have had more meaning if it wasn't used as often, and I might even have liked it.Shots of Kate Beckinsale usually entail moaning or some kind of sexy shots. I was trying to figure out whether she's enjoying the hits she's getting or not.I felt that this movie was a sexual fantasy of Kate by the director.if it had 5 more seconds of sex scene, I would have declared it as a Porn.IF you like stuff blowing up, sex, nudity, blood, gore and stuff, and EXPECT them from a movie, you'll love this and rate it 9 or 10IF you are moviegoer who wishes to see the humane side of the society and go to movies for dramatic realism, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

		<fullReview>I loved everything about the original film! The STORY, the scenes, the ending. The sequel, however, didn't live up to my expectations. It made up in action for what it lacked in story, but the story, in my opinion, was very weak. I don't feel that the history of the war between the 2 species (lycans &amp; vampires) wasn't told well at all. I had hoped there'd be more background info on Lucien, his wife and the vampire elders. Instead, the story went in a different direction.I also felt that there was no need for Alexander Corvinus to have been in the 2nd installment. Michael was more of a sidekick than a main character and I didn't like Len Wiseman's choice for Marcus. Ugh! Despite what I didn't like about Underworld 2, Kate Beckinsale was as great in it as she was in the 1st one! She was the best thing about the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a better than expected story continuation. I didn't know what direction this "sequel" was going to take but was very happy with the end result. Other movie sequels in the past have left me disappointed beyond belief, not U.E. The story added new depth to the first film and has answered some nagging questions IE: the medallion Lucian wore, why Viktor killed Selene's family and how Marcus fitted into the picture. The writers have done well to tie the two movies together and not get carried away with making another Vampire/Werewolf schlock fest. I'm of the opinion they have taken the right amount of time to get the stories to compliment each other. To watch these two films back to back would be easy as the story picks up from where it left off, which can quite often be forgotten in the movie industry. The growing love interest between Michael and Selene has gone to a whole new level in this movie which poses some very new nagging questions for future installments, hopefully the writers will get it right again. If you like the genre and more so the first installment then go and see what this new one has to offer you may be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale join up once again to create a great double team and they really do pull this one off showing on screen chemistry that helps you believe that what you are watching is real. Len Wisemen really has stepped up the violence as well and within the 1st 5 minutes of the film starting you know what you are in for with the most graphics violence securing it an R rating.

If you're looking for a Merchant-Ivory snooze-fest, then don't bother. But if you like vampire flicks, shoot-em up sci-fi fare or comic book action, you're in the right place.

		<fullReview>An excellent sequel to the series. Even taken at face value, the action, visual effects, and directing are excellent. The acting well above this class.Embedded below the superficial story, for those who like to explore hidden meanings and symbolism, this film (and indeed the series) are a very clever (and fresh) representation of another famous supernatural script. Interchange the words supernatural for spiritual (not that different). In the film you have a race of beings who's (supernatural) survival is based upon drinking blood ? the Vampires (can ya think of a mainstream religion that turns red wine into blood and drinks it for spiritual survival ?). And another race of beings who's hairiness sets them apart ? The Werewolves (think of another prominent religion who's members are not allowed to shave). Anyway, as the story goes these two races have been fighting for thousands of years. Between each other, and between themselves (switch on CNN and see how the analogy holds up..)And you'd never guess it, but in the film it now turns out that the two races (Vampires and Lychens) are actually born from the same father. (In our real life analogy, the father's name is a bloke called Abraham).In the film, the war finally ends, only when our heroin wipes out the two leaders, by defeating both sons (The Vampire and Lychen leaders).However, to do so she needs the blood of the father (of the two races). And in doing so she gains new power, representing something new (evolution).Analogously, in that book about Abraham,the final battle is fought (and won) by the one who by definition has "the blood of the father". Not one race or the other (anymore), but a new evolution.Does seem to be allot of films lately on this topic. You could be mistaken for thinking all hell was about to break loose in the Middle East :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...for this movie to make much sense; I didn't realize how much lore was communicated in the first one, and had to re-watch the first one after seeing this one to tie it together. It turns out they want to try to reference Hungarian mythology, but the new movie begins in 1202, and the ruler Corvinis mentioned isn't referenced historically until the mid 1400's, so the folks supposed to be his "sons" couldn't yet exist in 1202. I also think the lichens looked better in the first movie I thought, and the first movie did seem a bit more polished in some respects, but was also a smaller film in some ways - the action seems to take place across a broader area in this one, or at least some more elaborate sets.One error - the amulet that features prominently in the first film that belongs to Lucius the Lichen returns, but it's gotten thicker and larger somehow :-) Definitely recommend watching it for the steamy scene with Kate and Scott. All in all it's a good action romp, and it's not a bad sequel at all - it does seem to tie things up nicely. I wonder if they'll make a third?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but not on any great cerebral level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it's just nice to watch a movie with your brain out of gear, just enjoying the visual and auditory experience. Sometimes the movie lets you have no choice in the matter. This is one of those movies. If you expect to make too much sense of it all or get all arty and/or literary about it, then you're going to be disappointed. It is after all about Vampires and Werewolves, basically trying to kill the hell out of each other, for no good reason other than to entertain us with some seriously gratuitous gore and some delightful ass-kicking eye-candy in the form of Mrs B (don't get too excited - it's no skin flick - but her undersized leather suit is given continuous stress- testing).Who comes top of the food chain in this film is irrelevant really, because sooner or later, based on the voracious and very non-recyclable feeding and killing habits of either race, you suspect there will ultimately be no food chain to be top of (that's viruses for you). You really don't care anyway, because neither race has any real virtues to speak of. The werewolves are basically creatures who go around biting people. The vampires are basically creatures who go around biting people, albeit with a little more style.Enjoy the film for what it is rather than what it isn't. It's fast paced, stylish, sexy, well directed and photographed, has good atmospherics and lots of ultra-violence, with the gore volume switched to max. It isn't a film to be taken seriously or understood on anything other than a superficial comic-book level. If you liked the original, you'll probably like this a little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld: Evolution may be a muddled mess, but it is fun enough to recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something to be said for dumb action movies. That is that instead of huge buff guys shooting countless amounts of grunts, we instead have very slim, sexy girls going around and karate-chopping zombies and vampires to death. Underworld was among the first of this breed, and stands leagues above other movies in the same vein such as Resident Evil, Catwoman, Elektra, etc. Not only was the action much more satisfying than the others, it also contained some elements of a plot and even a decent twist. Sure, it was nothing exceptional on its own merits, but it was a good, fun action flick that didn't leave nearly as bad a taste as others of its kind. A sequel was kind of inevitable, and so was me seeing it, even if the first film was more of a nice diversion than a truly good movie. Thankfully, the second is the same, even if it is extremely muddled.Evolution starts off basically where the first movie left off. After a brief flashback that recounts how Selene (Beckinsale) was betrayed by her vampire kin, teamed up with vampire-werewolf hybrid Michael Corvin (Speedman) and killed vampire elder Viktor (Nighy). We are brought back in to see Michael and Selene still on the run from the vampires and Michael coming to grips with the fact he is no longer human. Any plans they had for a peaceful retreat go to hell when Marcus (Curran), the original vampire now infused with werewolf blood, goes after Selene in attempt to get her blood memories in order to find and release his brother William, the original werewolf, who was imprisoned by Viktor centuries ago.And, well, that's pretty much the whole plot. Aside from the introduction of a sex-crazed exile and a mysterious old man, the plot remains in a solid state of inertia throughout the whole movie. In other words, it only seems to progress in the last five minutes. Other than that, it boils to down four steps, which are fight Marcus, run away from Marcus, Marcus finds you, rinse, repeat. It really makes the movie feel much shorter than it actually is, and much less satisfying than the original.Also, if you have never seen the original, prepare to be extremely confused. In fact, even if it has simply been a while since you have seen the original, odds are you will be confused as well. Despite the numerous flashbacks to the first movie, pretty much all plot points are muddled to the point where if you didn't see the first right before seeing the second, you won't even know what is going on until an hour into the movie.Of course, who really needs to know what it going on in a movie like this? All we really need is a bunch of ghouls getting their asses handed to them to make this worthwhile, and Underworld Evolution certainly delivers in this regard. The numerous fistfights are extremely fun to watch, and spaced out pretty well. Any fight between Michael and Marcus is lots of fun, as they seem very evenly matched. The gun fights are a let down, as while plenty of bullets are spewed, they seem to do little to no damage. For example, Selene takes a shotgun to the gut early on the movie and does not even have a scratch in her clothing. It makes all the bang-bang considerably less satisfying.Of course, what would a vampire movie be without buckets of gore? Underworld certainly delivers in that regard. Why, not three minutes into the actual movie, some has their head chopped in half in the middle of a close-up. Throw in plenty of stabbing, slicing and jaw-ripping and we have a good old-fashioned gore fest that is sure to amuse action fans everywhere.As for acting, this is one of those movies where you can feel free to say who cares. Of course, if you look hard enough, it is pretty horrendous. Sure, Kate Beckinsale works very well with a sarcastic British attitude and is drop-dead gorgeous in skin-tight leather, but the same quality can't be said for the others. Speedman really never reaches the emotional height of Michael, which is only attempted once in the beginning, leaving the character as just a tag-along for the rest of the flick. Curran also never impresses outside of his hybrid makeup as Marcus. Overall, it may not be great, but you'll be to preoccupied with everything getting blown up to care.All in all, Underworld Evolution is a bit of a mixed bag. Sure, it has a handful of sweet action scenes and the perfect amount of gore, not to mention one of the less cringe-inducing hyper-action heroines around today, but it lacks with a muddled plot and pointless shootouts. While it doesn't reach the level that the first did, it still stands strong as a detour worthy for action fans. Of course, if hyper-action isn't your cup of tea, stray far, far away. 2006 is starting off decent.Overall Rating ? 69%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I do have to admit I couldn't wait till part two came out, so I bought the book Underworld:Evolution first. I have to say the movie is exactly like the book. Of course the book has more inner thoughts and goes into more detail, but, pretty much was the same. I was not disappointed. I am such a big fan! I hope there is an Underworld 3 sometime in the future; the action and drama were great. I would also like to recommend the prequel book to the first Underworld, "Underworld: Blood Enemy." That really explained the Sonja / Lucian relationship and romance; it was wonderful! I would love for them to make a movie on the "Blood Enemy" prequel book; it really made me really care for the character Lucian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first Underworld. Cheesy as it was, I sill enjoyed the story and action sequences(I would give it a 7/10). The sequel however has a big bag of problems. First off, did they really need all the back story stuff? And I don't mean the Midievil opening, that was *mostly* pretty cool (Some of the werewolf-attacking-vampires-on-horseback shots looked like crap, more on the special effects later.) Move on to Marcus, the first vampire ever who was in stasis along side Victor, whom was released and killed in the first movie. Marcus has wings that give Marcus apparent VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) capability while also stabbing people with their tips too. Marcus can also drink someone's blood and gain all their memories which we see as quick flashes. Get use to this for you will see it quite a bit as Len Wiseman uses this expositional crutch Ad Nausium (although this might not be entirely his fault, I can see the studio saying "make sure this will make sense to a fresh audience!"). So we are flashing through shots from the first movie which I don't remember and I'm gaining next to nothing here, so its only an annoying waste of time, GET TO BECKINSALE KICKING ASS! This is the only thing the movie does absolutely right and we get so little of it, very annoying.So, those wings on Marcus, they total suck, seeing him float alongside a truck Selene and her Hybrid friend are trying to get away in just pulled me right out of the film. The physics of what I'm seeing make no sense: How can you be supported by beating wings on your back while floating in a static manner (no bobbing) in an upright position?? Compare this to Lord of the Rings, to the Fell Beast or the Egeles, who have great weight and wind resistance characteristics, you buy it because its completely convincing. On the other side of that scale is Marucs flying around. The sad thing is this problem could have been easily solved if Wiseman had taken a page from the first Alien movie: Less is More. Four seconds of great looking establishing shots that show Marcus flying and threatening our hero's far outweigh the thirty some odd seconds of totally unbuyable crap. Then the rest is close ups of him where special effects can be less intensive. I understand and respect what this film is trying to do here, but if you can't do it right then don't do it that way.There is more silliness involving a revelation about the true origin of vampires and werewolves, but I can't go into detail with out using spoilers, so I won't. Just know that its mostly disappointing and the whole thing with Selene's past gets really sappy and annoying. All this subtracts into the negative against the kick ass fighting Selene and Michael portray. I say stick with the first film, where you get plenty of killer action, this sequel amplifies the weaknesses while diminishing the strengths of its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, an improvement over its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically takes up where the other one left off, with Beckinsale and the male bimbo/sidekick alternately running from and fighting the first vampire, who was accidentally awakened, apparently, at the end of the last movie. Sequel is far superior to the lackluster UNDERWORLD and is not half-bad more generally. While the script isn't exactly Tolstoy, it's better than the first one and especially deserves commendation for trying to patch up obvious story holes. The acting ain't really great, but it's better than the last one, especially Derek Jacobi's twenty minutes. Best of all, there's far more vampire/werewolf fisticuffs, something that was sorely lacking in the first one.Movie suffers from still not making a great deal of sense, from being shot under the now-requisite blue light that's quickly becoming a cliché, and from (surprisingly) some jumbled up action sequences. My guess is that quick editing was used to camouflage flaws in the CGI: for whatever reason, though, it's a step backward. Still, despite it's flaws it's fun. How can you hate a movie where so much stuff blows up, where so much blood gleefully flies, and which even has a little gratuitous nudity? You can't, that's the thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! But Not Better Than The First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of Underworld fans will tell you that Underworld: Evolution is better than the first. This is simply not true. While it is an amazing movie, it relies too much on lightning quick action scenes and not QUITE enough on back story or plot. Most of the plot holes from the first movie are filled in yet even MORE holes develop in this one! One major hole is the account of Selene being "saved" by Viktor and him turning her into a vampire. In the first movie, it is made to seem like she was only recently (recent in vampire years being 200-300 years) converted. Yet her back story in Underworld: Evolution is that her family built William's prison and Viktor had them executed so Marcus couldn't get the location from them. That would mean that she was around for the "fall" of Lucian and she would've known the story behind it without having to look it up in the history books as she did in the first Underworld. I'm still trying to figure out the logic behind this and how it all ties in.All complaints about the inconsistencies with the story aside, it was nice to have a much more fleshed out history of the vampire and lycan races. The fight scenes were incredible to watch and the CGI and puppet work (for William) was extremely well done. The lycans looked much better than they did in the first movie and their movements were much more smooth. The opening sequence to the movie has to be the best I have seen since Gladiator or Equilibrium.Overall this is an incredible movie. The story and the action don't quite fit together but the film is still greater than the sum of it's parts and I can't wait to see the next installment!</fullReview>

Go for the eye candy, and you'll be pleased.I give it a 7 out of 10, based solely on the amount of violence/gore in the movie, as it rounds out at one hour and 46 minutes, unlike the original which spent almost 2 and 1/2 hours explaining the plot with little action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) "Underworld: Evolution" traces the ancient feud that began in 1202 between the immortal vampires and werewolves. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is the beautiful vampire warrior, who joins forces with Michael (Scott Speedman), a werewolf hybrid to discover the truth about her ancient bloodline. Selene and Michael not only unite as a team, but as lovers. Selene is on the run from her vampire tribe, because she killed Viktor, the leader of the Vampire world. The son of the original vampire, Marcus (Tony Curran), has been released from his tomb, and he is looking for revenge and his brother.(Comment) If you liked the first movie, you must see this one, because it is better. The action in the opening segment sets the pace of the movie. The special effects and action are great. The scene where the winged Marcus is pursuing Selene and Michael in a truck was impressive. Kate Beckinsale does an awesome acting job as Selene, and her fighting choreography was outstanding. It is rated R because there is a sex scene between Selene and Michael. We learn of a new power that the original vampires have when they drink the blood of other vampires. There will probably be a third movie, because the audience likes Kate Beckinsale in this part. (Screen Gems, Run time 1:46, Rated R)(8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't catch the first film at the cinema but bought it as a bargain basement DVD, and thoroughly enjoyed it - with the exception of one unbelievably weak performance; whose character thankfully gets hoist on his own petard early in this chapter! Before popping along to see the movie I caught the review on the Empire web-site - a one star drubbing; but by a reviewer who confessed he dis-liked no. 1.I really enjoyed this film. It continues straight on from Underworld with barely a pause for breath. I dragged my wife along, who has a great penchant for letting her eye-lids drop in time with the lights - she loved it; and now wants to re-watch the first film. Bear in mind that Juliette is a 47 year old mum, although a bit of a all-right if I say so myself, and you'll see that this is hardly the demographic this would be expected to appeal to. I believe that the factors that helped are the more linear story arc, good performances, and good chemistry between the leading actors.In fact the acting was of a good standard throughout. Beckinsale can undoubtedly act, although she has been in some prize turkeys - including Van Helsing and Pearl Harbour. Derek Jacobi, would you believe, lends some gravitas turning in his usual excellent performance in what is a key role to the selling of the story.The issues in the screenplay were not so glaring as to pull me out the story....and certainly a magnitude less than a lot of films released over the last few years.Overall I have enjoyed both the Underworld films far more than the Blade movies, the stories have simply been more interesting to me....and however good Wesleys' performance Kate does a lot more for me in her leather gear! A very strong recommendation for anyone who enjoyed part 1; this is better. If you didn't enjoy the first instalment then this will probably be a waste of your time.</fullReview>

I mean, i've seen so many vampire movies, which tells that there's only one true vampire called "dracula" or the kinds, but in this movie, everything sort of fits together. The two and a half hours didn't feel like it, more like 30 minutes. The actors/actresses were brilliant act. i'm loving it and i'd like to watch it again. the only downside is they need to make it longer. I wish the 3rd underworld will be out again and probably talking about the true-blooded vampire family, that'd be cool ;p.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I went to see this movie first and foremost because of KB, it was for a different reason than most of the male reviewers, I love a strong female lead and I got that in spades in U:E. Scott Speedman ain't so bad either, but make no mistake this is Kate Beckinsale's movie. She has this character down pat, warrior with a femme side. The great British actors Mr. Nighy (Victor) and sir D. Jacoby (Alexander) lend credibility to a much maligned genre and to this script. I have to say many accolades to director Wiseman for how he chose to shoot this film it an homage to film noir. The action, set design, cinematography and story are compelling and virtually seamless. Hard to believe that each film takes place over a span of 2 days, with so much packed into each film and in a cohesive manner as to follow without getting lost. Now with Selene and Michael evolving into these incredible beings, there are questions left to be answered, like what of Amelia's Coven, and the other Lycans? I have already seen this movie twice and will see it again soon. Hopefully Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman will grace us with a third installment. I can't wait!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a hardcore defender of the average popcorn actioner, and I'm a sucker for Vampires and Werewolves, but suffice it to say that the first Underworld was so bad I was compelled to see this only out of morbid, masochistic curiosity.The dialogue is bad, but they might have gotten away with it if everybody didn't take themselves so incredibly seriously. Every single line is announced with the sort of mighty import usually associated with pessimistic news from a trusted family Doctor.The leads actually manage to have even less chemistry than the first go round, a pretty serious problem given that their relationship is supposed to be strong enough to transcend all sorts of terrible obstacles. And the sex scene is catastrophically bad - never before have attractive people made for such boring nudity. It must surely be remembered as one of the worst of it's ilk. Beyond Matrix Reloaded, maybe even on par with Showgirls.The plot manages to be both incoherent and contradictory. Characters behave nonsensically and the plot holes open into plot maws with every increasingly laboured revelation. However, the streamlined pace compared to the first at least make this less irksome.But for all that, it is a big step up from it's predecessor. The action scenes borrow even more heavily from Blade, but the action editing and fighting in general is much improved. The CGI is more convincing, and the stunts are better. Not worth seeing in the cinema, certainly, but for a last resort rental you could do worse. Equally though, there are much better films in this vein, Constantine or Blade both maintain a similar dark stylised look without so many po-faced speeches or dodgy plot twists.</fullReview>

Finally a Vampire/Werewolf movie series where we get see Vampires, and Werewolfs use all there immortal powers. There is a lot of story info going on, and its really geared towards people that already know the basics of Vampires and Werewolfs.

		<fullReview>First I have a problem with the Quote that is posted on IMDb.comIt was Tanis that said "You don't scare me, Selene." Not Kraven.IMDb check your facts when posting information.The movie at times was confusing. The fights scenes were good but the dark lighting and speed of the filming for which the scene was shot, made it difficult to see who was hitting who and how they were hitting their victims. You end of saying to yourself or to your movie buddy, "what was that?" "Did you see that?" "Can you make out what just happened?"The love scene between Selene and Michael was nice. It wasn't as awkward as some love scenes can be. Points to Wisemen the Director for a nice scene between his wife and another man.Performances by Michael (Scott Speedman) and Marcus (Tony Curran) are the best in the film. You might leave the show saying Michael was Hot and Marcus was cool as the villain.You don't need to see the first to see the second, the director took care of that with flash backs, but then again, you will be happier with the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld 2 is an excellent sequel. Its by no means a perfect movie but it does manage to better the original or at least match it. In terms of its mix of story and action, this film combines the two elements quite well. Unlike the first, which i thought lacked the action that the previews promised and went too far in with the details. Which isn't always a bad thing but thats what expectations can do for a movie.In this second coming of Selene and Papa Smurf aka Scotty Speedman, the Vampire nation is shaken by the deceit and secrets of their former leaders Viktor and Kraven. Selene and Michael are now on the run looking to escape their enemies which are pretty much everyone on the planet.The movie starts off well with a scene detailing significant events that shed light on how things in the world have become and also shed light on Selene's family and past.Underworld Evolution does an exceptional job of explaining the unexplained elements in the first installment, and also leaves just enough room and mystery for a third film to complete the intended trilogy. Unlike Matrix, this sequel was well planned and executed, and unlike the Matrix it did not have to live up to critical praise or commercial hype. The critics ripped this movie unfairly and they should really remove the object that was up their behinds and just try to enjoy this action packed popcorn popping' ride.10 out of 10... only because it does what its supposed to well, without anything more or less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is a great way to follow up the first. It takes you back, all the way to the beginning when Markus (the elder) and his brother were at war. Being an avid fan of the first, I wouldn't say this is better - but it definitely comes close.As far as plot continuation, this rocks. The follow up to Celine/Michael and the finish of the first is perfect, revealing the history of Celine and the Corvinus-es. Without spoiling anything it reveals a lot about the unrest between the elders. The development of Michael (the Hybrid) is also well done, continuing in the path that he still hasn't figured himself out entirely in some ways but has the ability to control his transformation and beyond. The powers he has come upon are beyond those that anyone saw - superb.If you don't like the violence, of course because some people don't, then DO NOT see this. The fight scenes are unbelievable, absolutely amazing, with a wide array of endings for people killed.The film is actually less about vampires/lycans than I would've liked, and in some ways I think it's very military based. The whole plot of Lucian/Kraven/Viktor/Celine from the first is remembered but not really played upon so much.I went to see this and can honestly say, it's the best spent ?5 in a long time. Definitely, if you liked the first, go see this film. Top notch.</fullReview>

It certainly isn't a great classic nor is it as bad as some of these critics seem possessed to make out.I will say this..fans of the original film (just 'Underworld')like me will follow the sequel just about keeping up with the names such as 'Marcus', 'William', 'Viktor'etc.(has been 3 yrs since original!) The vampire vs werewolf family lineage is a very clever and interesting root to what hopefully will be a trilogy. A family of immortals father (Jacobi wonderful as ever) and 2 sons in the an inner and tragic circle of conflict with the consequences of their actions and shear will creating an outer circle of war involving 'Salene' AND 'Michael'.BUT on the other hand people just fancying a good old Friday action/horror flick at the cinema without having seen the original will get rather confused with the afore mentioned characters...'who was Marcus', 'who was William again?' were the mutterings as bemused but satisfied punters left the screening room.This is where I can understand critics having a look in. If you don't follow the sequence of events from the first film the second (on its own) can be interpreted as clumsy. Yet that is where the negativity stops the action sequences and wonderful life like and NON CG effects come to full bloom.. The vampires especially Marcus look wonderful (reminded me of Coppolas Dracula bat). Minimised CG works beautifully with werewolves and vampires changing into their respective forms effortlessly satisfying the audience fully and realistically. The gore is crisp and will please those inclined towards it and the cinematography like the first is beautiful, haunting and balletic. Acting is so so but Bekinsale 'Salene' in corset and wetsuit constantly diverts your attention from such mild shortcomings (women will be equally diverted by a buff Speedman 'Michael').All in all A rare and satisfying SEQUEL movie. To those going to see it watch the first one (especially the extended edition) and go watch this you will at the very least be entertained for 2 hours and at best be absorbed in to a fantasy/horror/action film with an engaging story line and director who keeps the plot at the centre of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it at a preview showing last night. I enjoyed myself a lot. However, Alexander Corvinus's ship was for a me a symbol of what is wrong with the movie. Large, cool-ish looking windows in the bow? A modern ship capable of landing a helicopter apparently made out of wood for no apparent reason except that it allows the vampires to break through it? Nope, looks good, but makes very little sense. Also it features one of my pet peeves, the intricate, ancient mechanism which still works perfectly after centuries of neglect including immersion in water. Also, the helmets worn in the opening scene look like they were elf army surplus from Weta Workshops rather than say something that looks like it was worn in the Balkans in the 13th century.However, the action is cool and if amusingly over the top at times. Derek Jacobi puts in an interesting performance as the viewer is unsure for quite a long time which side, if any, he is on. You get a sense of him having lived too long as an observer and being unable to decide how to act. You get a sense of great weariness from having lived for centuries.All in all, good fun, but it ain't going to win an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the first installment on DVD, and loved it. I went to the theaters for this one, and though I did not find it to be disastrous, I thought it was much inferior to the first one. The story is pretty bad. The dialogue is only OK. Without disclosing much about the movie, my feeling is that it loses out compared to the first one, by not being set as much in an urban environment, where your vampires and lychens could interact with humans more freely. You also had a nice "Gotham-City" like atmosphere that you totally lose in this one.Having said that, the cast has to be somewhat blamed here. Decent, at best performances, from everyone, aside from the truly evil looking Bill Nighy, can't pull this average story anywhere. Kate Beckinsale in particular should thank her lucky stars that she looks amazing in tight latex spandex-o-pant-o-glue-on-thingies, because unfortunately her acting skills were clearly saved for another movie (hopefully not Underworld 3).I don't think anyone will find this movie satisfying at the theaters. For the die-hard fans out there, if you haven't seen it already, wait until it comes out on DVD. For anyone who has not seen "Underworld" (i.e. the first installment), save your money and rent that on DVD instead.Kate Beckinsale (Selene) - 4/10 - Gorgeous actress who looks great in latex tights, but really doesn't show much acting skill here.Scott Speedman (Michael Corvin) - 5/10 - Decent, but should not quit his day-job.Tony Curran (Marcus) - 6/10 - Decent, but non-issue.Derek Jacobi (Corvinus) - 6/10 - Decent, but non-issue.Bill Nighy (Viktor) - 8/10 - Scary as always. Check him out in the Constant Gardener.Len Wiseman - 5/10 - Must bear some blame for pretty bad acting throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but just doesn't live up its own great concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While its more entertaining and faster on its feet than the original, underworld evolution suffers the same problem as the original-it just doesn't justify its undeniably cool werewolves vs vampires concept.A story that pits werewolves against vampires promises a lot more than this film and its predecessor delivers.Its all a tad disappointing really.Like the original it looks stunning , has nice action sequences and lots of intriguing ideas but the story just isn't engaging enough to work as a whole movie.Plus the characters, particularly the two main heroes , just aren't that interesting- you really wont be shocked or upset if bad things happen to them.Also it makes the mistake of taking itself waaaay to seriously and skimping on the humour .If you laugh then it will probably be at the unintentionally hilarious sex scene that just felt tacked on for those with short attention spans who will no doubt struggle through the films many lengthly exposition scenes.Its not a bad film -there lots of great comic bookish action to keep you sporadically entertained but on the whole underworld evolution (much like part 1) emerges as a disappointing take on a brilliant concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, however, there's not enough story to warrant 105 minutes of cinema !This is a typical Americanish-method of Hollywood !Wishing Underworld-Evolution 140 minutes !(Those with higher artistic tastes can enjoy !)Tony Curran is a weak villain, although most of the time the makeup department gives him a boost !The only cool character was Kraven(Shane Brolly )in first Underworld and now he is only 10 minutes in this Film !(Kraven is an aristocratic Vampire monarch who is infatuated with power. He has secured reign over the Vampires during Viktor's hibernation. He is the epitome of the evolved Vampire species, a highly refined prince of darkness lavishing in the pleasures of sex, parties and manipulative power. On the surface, he maintains a calm distance from the archaic bloodbaths and violence of the relic Vampire covens. Yet underneath he is mischievous and conniving, using his lieutenant, Soren, to do his dirty work. Kraven's debonair charm disenchants the only thing his power cannot grant him: the unattainable love of Selene !)Unfortunately, there's little wit or genuine suspense to elevate the proceeding's above the level of a cheesy comic book. Beckinsale looks quite fetching reprising her trademark dual gun firing pose -- hell.Kate Beckinsale, as the vampire Selene, clad in the tightest form-fitting black latex imaginable. Even the love scene between Beckinsale and her boy-toy Scott Speedman seems awkwardly and abruptly placed. Sure, fans of the original will enjoy the hot werewolf-on-vampire action, but with such flaws, it's not likely to win over anyone who isn't already a monster.When he's not human, Marcus looks like a mucus-covered Nosferatu, but he brawls as if he is a dancer who happens to be on "Ultimate Fight Championship." In one terrific scene, he flies after the truck Selene's driving with Michael the were-pure in the cab. No matter how many times Marcus is impaled or UZIed in the face, he keeps coming back .The movie also exhibits a cool eroticism .Michael needs fresh blood to survive. And to save him, Selene once lets him drink from her wrist. Later they run from the sunlight and into each other's arms. Their obligatory lovemaking, however, suffers from being ordinary. Sucking on her wrist was hotter!Visually, the second Underworld replicates the first. Everything is blue and grimy, and there's a monochromatic, metallic look to each scene. Instead of using dissonant rock on the soundtrack !With an American Director Wiseman ,this is a very Americanish production ! Sorry , I had been waited for a long time , at least , a little old-English chemistry and atmosphere !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, you can't talk about this movie, without talking about 'Underworld 1', the first movie was rich in details, but the story was lame, cheesy and ultimately unconvincing, it was a weak movie but entertaining, because it had it's moments, mainly because of the well directed action scenes, i gave it a 5/10.Now, this movie here, is extremely boring, they try to portray an even over the top, exaggerating cheesy story, I won't get into details, because I don't wanna spoil the movie, but it's the same old, same old, breaking all the rules, the first one, world domination, blah blah, the usual, the cast is unimpressive, good looking, but unimpressive, the action scenes are very cartoon like, the soundtrack is boring and the story is predictable, what a waste of money and time it was to see this movie, the worst is that at the end we hear some lame monologue practically announcing 'Underworld 3', sigh, I gave it a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable movie and worth the price of admission. I enjoy "girl kicks ass" movies.It has a lot of action and gore, but is not a horror or suspense film. I would not take anyone under twelve to it.If you are thinking of seeing this movie I strongly recommend seeing the original Underworld. Otherwise, you will be a bit lost.In comparison to the original, this movie is short of character development and emotional connection. Not that there was much in the original.I liked the craftsmanship on this movie. The movie was well-paced. It didn't have incessant tiresome action scene after action scene, but neither did it get bogged down.The CG was good except that the helicopter didn't look real when it was flying. Yes, the werewolves and vampires looked real. The helicopter didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire Devolution, more like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirkman and McBride's 'Underworld: Evolution' is near-impenetrable toss.Kate Beckinsale - the poshest vampire in the whole wide world ? poses and pouts her way across Eastern Europe, looking rather fetching in her ever-so-shiny leather and rubber ensemble. Bill Nighy chews the scenery, and much of the script ? oddly managing, at various points, to sound as though he's faking an upper-class English accent (mind you, he's probably just over compensating, as no-one is quite as posh as Kate?not even the Queen!) ? which, as he was bumped off at the end of the first film, is something of an achievement. Derek Jacobi, wearing a rather fetching 18th century uniform, tries to take the whole thing seriously, and probably gives the best performance in the film. That, however, isn't saying much.'Underworld' was a pretty, if derivative (it ripped off elements of 'The Crow' to a ludicrous degree) shoestring-budgeted sleeper. It had a cack, muddled script, and uninspired performances, and the first third of this film is spent pretty much knocking-off supporting characters from that movie, recapitulating it's more convoluted plot-points, and effectively re-writing the in-house mythology. Once that tedious business is out of the way it gets on with being what it really is ? a silly, fetish-friendly Gothic gore-fest. You want heads and limbs ripped off? You got 'em! You want guns a-blazin' in a selection of crusty Carpathian castles, populated by b-list British character actors and CGI monsters? This is the place for you.There are a few muted attempts to hint at subtlety, as Selene and her werewolf/vampire hybrid boyfriend take the first tentative steps towards the foundation of a new 'path' for their tribes. These are, however, delivered with all the subtlety of a sandpaper suppository. Mostly Big-Guns-Go-Bang.Another sequel is inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the storyline and plot of the movie. But they completely trashed the entire movie by adding the scenes with sex and nudity. if it weren't for those, the movie would be great. They went a spoiled a good thing they had going with the first movie, by adding things that didn't contribute to the plot at all. it was cool that they started out with showing how the war started with William, Marcus, Viktor, and Amelia. if they had less gore it would be cool too. They also couldv'e taken out all the language and they would still have had a good movie, with the exception of the nudity and sex. for example, Blade wasn't too bad of a movie, take out the scene at the rave party and it would've been excellent, minus the language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While doing research for the new Underworld: Evolution, I was moderately surprised at the success of its predecessor, simply titled Underworld. The first film pit vampires and werewolves (or Lycans as they were called) against each other with Kate Beckinsale all clad in a leather outfit caught in the middle of the all out war.What surprised me was when in googled the overall gross of the original film. Made for just over $20 million the film went on to a world wide gross of $100 million. Add on the DVD revenue after that and?. Fuggedaboutit! And let me add that it was well deserved. After viewing Underworld at the 2003 premiere, I was impressed with everything from the color usage (or lack therefore), the story, the effects, the action. In short, the movie.Not aware of the following for the film, the trailers for a sequel intrigued me. Luckily, this time Hollywood was smarter than this guy who sits on a soft chair in front of a word processor.Underworld: Evolution takes place right where Underworld left off. Well, sort of. After a brief history as to how all the chaos began centuries ago, the film quickly takes us back to our two heroes, Selene (Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) who are on the run after having killed the leader of the nightwalkers ? Viktor.Note: For those of you who have not seen the first, you would be well schooled if you did, but be assured that there are enough flashbacks to act as a paint-by-numbers set.This time, the whole world seems to be against them. The vampire family is after them for killing one of their own. The Lycans are after them because Michael is a rare hybrid (I'll spare myself a paragraph and just refer you to film one). And the humans take shots at them whenever they get the chance just because they know they are at the bottom of the food chain. But these three parties don't even hold a candle to Markus ? the evil 'first vampire' that has been awakened and is out to free his brother from centuries of captivity. His brother, as luck would have it, is an uncontrollable Lycan.Got all that. Sounds a bit confusing, but that is all part of the fun. Where most thriller/horrors of his sort elect for the KISS standard (Keep It Simple Stupid), Underworld : Evolution has action, adventure, scares and thrills, but keeps you on your toes with a better than average storyline to go alone with the carnage.The end result, is a movie that is a lot of fun to watch and is a true departure from the seriousness of the dramas still hogging all the theatre screens being the Oscar silly season and all.What exactly do I mean as 'fun'. Well, a fight between the Lycans and the Vampires in an ancient village fun. A truck battle between the turned Michael and Markus that as heart pumping as it is, is still the second best action sequence of the film fun. Chopped heads, ripped out hearts and tongues, punctures, stabs and blood gushing neck bites fun. What can I say, it's a perfect date movie.Now to say that Underworld : Evolution is not for everyone would be stupid as if you didn't know what you were in store for before you laid down a mortgage payment to get a ticket then you don't deserve to be entertained. But those that appreciate this genre will revel in the fight between evil and more evil. All while suppressing your own impure thoughts watching Beckinsale run around in an outfit that I would sell my home for if ever put on e-bay.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I would like to say that what critics say about this type of movie means nothing. Most movie critics have their strict narrow view of what makes a good movie. In my mind, I want to walk into a movie and be entertained. This movie had a decent plot. We don't go and see these types of movies for plot, but for action. The action sequences are pretty good. The gore is a plenty. Lastly, Beckingsale is stunningly hot. I would watch any movie she is in. She not only brings a beautiful presence to a movie, but she can also act. I love action and horror films. So, a bit of both is great. What can you say about the special effects is that they improved it for this film. I would love to see a third if they make one. Nuff said!!!</fullReview>

The fighting was awesome as was the special effects. More details were padded out and the beginning had a short overview - so that those who step into evolution without seeing the first Underworld - can easily follow .Excellent Job.

		<fullReview>Awesome film, takes all the action a step up from the last. Its so rare these days to have a sequel pick up directly when the last one left but this does it! Kudos to Len Wiseman for having the almost the ENTIRE original cast reprise their roles and not replacing the ones that didn't. I kind of missed Raze though. Selene is a much better ass-kicker in it. Thumbs down for not upping the booby factor. I guess when you wife is the star of the film, you might be a little reluctant to get her naked, but I'll be happy with what we got. Much better villain in this one. A bit drawn out, but well worth it. Might be a little difficult for people who have not seen the first to understand, but it did a great job trying. GORE GORE GORE WAAAAYYY up in this installment. Hopefully the DVD will include some stuff we didn't see. Can't wait for the next one!!! I can only pray that it isn't ruined by using the obligatory pregnancy angle that might be used...don't dissappoint me Len.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, it was amazing how I could have thought that this movie might have been half-way decent. I went into the movie not having seen the prequel, but by the time the credits rolled I realized that it didn't matter anyway. Here are a few things wrong with the movie:The special effects were way cheesy. William, the were wolf that was locked away by Selene's father looked like something from an X-files. It can in no way hold up to King Kong or even Harry Potter (the dragon.) The original vampire guy (I think he was Marcus) also looked X-files-ish with his alien-like face.There were way too many things copied from other movies. A couple of cool sequences that are borrowed would be OK for me, but to name a few:-Selene uses the same reloading technique as Lara Croft with the double pistols.-The whole vampires fighting super vampires theme was already done in Blade, and Underworld didn't bring anything special to it.-Michael (Selene's werewolf friend) did the "get away from me" line from Hulk (also a crappy movie but still.)-Selene's costume reminded me too much of Trinity from the Matrix, with the all black skin-tight look.-The beginning scene where the first vampires were fighting the first werewolves looked too much like in Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings where the orcs are fighting the Elves - there's nothing new there either.Finally, it seems to me that the filmmakers decided to throw in a sex scene to throw in some variety, not for any special plot purpose. It was obvious to the viewer that Selene and Michael loved each other without having them strip down right after being chased by Marcus and start getting it on in a car garage. Besides, it's unrealistic. Would you seriously want to do the Humpty Dumpty right after you almost got killed by the vampire-freak?Overall, a pretty crappy movie. Please, PLEASE, don't waste your money. Watch Blade, The Matrix, or Lord of the Rings instead.-UCanCallMeBob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Len Wiseman really likes the word 'hybrid.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay--Mr. Wiseman obviously likes repeating the word 'hybrid' all over the place. I agree with what I've read on some other posts about this movie. It wasn't awful...but it wasn't very good either. I know there's a lot of folks that really, really want these movies to be incredible, but they just aren't. The strength of the first movie, which had much less action, was in the vamps/wolves backstory and all the betrayal involved. That's gone here. In fact, I don't think there was a single pure "Lycan" in this film--just the monster-don't-revert-to-humans-ones. Okay, fine; but I miss the clear-cut war that was talked up so much in the first film.I wish also that Lucian and Viktor could have played a bigger part, even though they're dead. Bill Nighy does so much acting in the little frame of dialog he has its kinda funny. He's gonna make sure you remember he was in this thing for like four minutes. But the real problems are in the story and pacing; things are getting murky fast. There is no good outline of what Marcus intends to do in becoming godlike--he just goes to get his brother ( a big dumb monster-wolf named William who didn't really do anything). Who exactly is the character of Alexander? I understand what they said in the film, but this could have been better. And he's so old and powerful but chinks out with the whole " I don't feel like it" routine? Fine.Who is Tanis? Better yet, who cares? Now, the hybrid thing is getting silly. Marcus, Selene, and Michael?! I thought Michael was cool for being different, now he's not. These people keep suckin' and bitin' each other like this, and the whole bunch will end up as some sick creature. I dunno, I just think it was silly.At least Kraven died right away. Sorry, I'm just not a fan of this underworld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werewolves, Vampires and Quick Cuts! OH MY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the original, I can say I had high hopes for this film when I first walked into the theater. When I walked out, I was less than disappointed. This sequel stands as more of a joke than the original did, which is sad simply because both had the necessary elements to make a good film. A decent story of a family inner war that became a world's problem, a struggling couple looking to find their own place in that same world, and most of all a war that has raged on for centuries due in part to the family inner turmoil.With that said, I will now say that the film does not fail because of cheesy acting or over dramatic fight sequences. Those are new defining elements of the action genre and I full heartily expect them as so should all of you once you walk into the movie. If I see werewolves growling, I'd expect some limbs flying off and men being ripped to shreds. The makeup and character designs were, in fact, down right petrifying at moments. Marcus and William both stand out as classic movie monster villains and Marcus does an excellent job of keeping up with that role in his acting. Even the locations are dark, graphic and fitting for the movie in which they are placed. A pure blend of the Gothic elements of old Europe and technological means of today gives the movie that time line of the characters that they have been around for a long time, but still are able to move along with the rest of the world with each new enhancement of life.Where this film fails is simply put, the editing. The attempt at a fast pace, razzle dazzle approach to this film makes for the fight sequences to make the audience say "what just happened?!" or "my eyes hurt from the flashing!" I warn those prone to seizures to stay far away from this movie at all costs. With that said, the character of William is only scene really on screen for a few key moments at which point his terrifying presence is brilliantly displayed. Unfortunately through editing, the poor beast becomes a less than formidable foe due to the quick cuts and pans that ruin a perfectly choreographed fight sequence.This film has been compared to Blade and Matrix for the action sequences, the vampire nature, and even the art work of the film. However, what the Matrix and Blade did right was allowing the actors to show their fighting skills and have the camera just far enough back to focus mainly on the fight, but Underworld: Evolutions tragically got up into the face of the fight making everyone in the audience as disoriented as possible.If you have ADD, this film is a perfect mix of just the right elements to keep you entertained and not squirming in your seat. If you are looking for mere enjoyment out of the vampire versus werewolf tale, you also will not be entirely disappointed. However, if you are looking for some more interesting action sequences other than a rather steamy sex sequence between the main characters, you may want to save your money for the DVD release or go rent the original... Awh, hell, the original is worth another look anyway.</fullReview>

The story behind the blood feud emerges, showing off Marcus and William--the first of the Corvinus clan--the first vampire and werewolf. This movie while it is a fun watch, is also extremely complex. Themes such as love, hate, rage, revenge, etc. are expressed, showing that these creatures possess ounces of humanity even when they shun it. This movie was well-worth my 10.25, and I'd be willing to pay as much to see it again. If you were a fan of Underworld, this movie is a MUST SEE for you!

Okay, okay...I don't mean through the entire movie, in fact, the reprise music from the original Underworld which acts as the love theme music was a welcome return. But the main theme music...awful. Killed it. There was nothing wrong with goth metal and trip hop music that lingered in and out of scenes in the first movie. And the Selene saves the day themes were good in the new one...but man, I thought I heard people laughing at how cheesy the music sounded during the opening credits as the title comes up.Kubrick once said that music can make or break a film...On Underworld Evolution...break. Oh but other than that I loved...Hold on...Okay the Helicopter had a bigger part in this movie than characters with actual speaking parts. Worse than that...it looked super fake in some scenes. I had such high hopes that this movie was gonna rock more than it did. Too much re-telling of events with flashbacks.So now you're probably wondering why such a high rating...the movie kicks ass. It really does...but its just not as dark as the original. What happened to the rain? It was almost non existent. Plenty of artificial lightning from a guy holding a strobe light albeit. Why did the exterior shots of the car driving on the mountain side road look inexcusably Second Unit? By this I mean its execution and style compared to the first one. But people keep knocking it for the wrong reasons. I give it a 10 because I still love the idea of Vampires Vs. Werewolves. I love the characters...I love Selene. The action was cool. The special effects for Marcus are amazing. And people cheered during the movie. Thats always a plus...its part of what I pay for. The overall experience if you will.I give it a 10 because the PG-13 vibe I was getting while watching it, even though it is in fact rated R, gives me hope for an extended Director's Cut DVD. I give it a 10 because I hope it looks better on its IMDb user ratings. I give it a 10 because I hope Len Wiseman reads this. Silence sucks...eerie music playing in the background during exposition is good...its worked for years...it worked on the first film please remix the soundtrack and score to Underworld-Evolution. Or I'm afraid my rating will change once it hits the small screen. Finally...the sound effect used to show little Selene and friends during a flashback which is supposed to be children playing has been used in every movie for the last 10 years...Len Wiseman has handed this movie over to the wrong people in post production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Contains mild spoilersIt was the fall of 2003 when the original came out and it was considered a success in the box office totalling over $50 million domestically. DVD sales also did tremendously well. This results an instant sequel. And here it is.Leather-clad Kate Beckinsale returns to the Underworld for a second time around to kick some serious Lycan's butt. The war between two creatures of the night has waged for centuries - war between Vampires and Werewolves. The movie starts off with a little narration and summarization to everything than happened up to the end of the original. (If you haven't seen the first one, prepare yourself for some major spoilers.) We also get a little taste of their history. Alexander Corvinus has two sons: Marcus who was bitten by bat and William bitten by wolf. From what they've shown, William, unfortunately, cannot control his wolf form thus results chaos and destruction to poor villages in 1202 A.D. Viktor took William captive and sent him away to a remote location for all eternity. His brother Marcus was not so pleased with this decision.Kate and Michael has been living on the edge because of Viktor's death and deceit. Back in the mansion, Kraven returns to destroy Marcus' body while he is still in hibernation. Little did he know, Singe's blood has waken him up making him stronger than ever before. He is able to sprout humongous wings that could literally rip a person in half. Now that he's awaken, his one goal is to set William free. Those who are bitten by William will turn into werewolf and can never go back in their human form. On the other hand, it turns out that Alexander Corvinus still lives and he's the one who's been cleaning up traces of battle between vampires and lycans. Kate and Michael learned the truth and purposed of the medallion through Tanis( a newly introduced character). Kate, Michael and along with Alexander's soldiers, they must stop Markus before he releases his evil brother.If you liked the original or you considered it as one of your guilty pleasure movies, then this movie will definitely worth your time. This sequel surely beat the crap out of the first one. There is more action sequences in this movie than the first one put together. This movie is Blade 2-ish to sum it up. It is action-packed. Also quite gory in some parts. Unlike the first one, the screenplay is polished and the pacing of the film is much better. The director sticks with practical creatures mixed with a little CG and that resulted a visual masterpiece. Rental or theatre? If you hated the original, you'll probably going to hate this too but in a lesser degree. If that's the case, rent it just to see what happens to the characters you hated and/or fell in love with. The love story between Selene and Michael grows stronger in this sequel. Biting each other in the neck would've been enough but NO. It turned out to be somethin' like this..Michael: "We've just been through a very rough day. You know, we could have sexual intercourse right now." Selene: "You read me like a book, loverboy."+ Selene cursing. + Kraven gets what he deserved. + awesome fight scenes. + Selene wears her leather suit once again. + Nude vampires. + Selene half naked. + Good creature design.- Selene doing the 100 foot jump again. - Shirtless Michael. - Unnecessary and overdone sex scene. - Alexander Corvinus' death. - No wide open window for another good sequel. - Too much memory flashbacks.If it was someone else playing the role of Selene, I would easily give it a 6/10. Kate Beckinsale steals two bias pointsMy Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What? You were expecting me to say that this is an exception to the rule about sequels being much worse than the originals? Why belabor the obvious? Just like the original HIGHLANDER film, we get a creepy foreword. Just like the 007 films, we get a slam-bang prologue. And, then, after the flashing of the title, we get an update on Michael and Selene from the voluptuous vampire herself.It's the same night as their showdown with Viktor (Selene's sire) and Lucian (the Alpha Lycan). The latter two are dead. But, the sole surviving Elder Vampire--Marcos Corvinus--is up and about. And, the blood memories he absorbs (from the aptly-named Kraven) immediately put him on the fugitives' trail.He wants to avenge the Final Deaths of his two fellow Elders. Right? Wrong! He's out to find his long-lost twin brother, William. The Adam of Werewolves!!! And, so uncontrollable, that he had to be locked away (hopefully forever) in what you might call a "Silver Maiden." As if that's not enough, there's a third party seeking the fugitives. A briefly mysterious character played--with convincing pathos--by Sir Derek Jacobi.* Along the way, we have action-packed battles featuring further metamorphoses by Michael (the genetically-engineered "lycanthropire"). Cleverly spliced-together flashbacks that reveal just how much of an amateur Kraven was, in the Duplicity Department, compared to Viktor. And, best of all? A love scene between Michael and Selene that was delightfully under-stated.Full nudity, mind you! But, shot from the their sides. And, with just enough shadow in the foreground, so as not to cheat those of us movie-goers who prefer to use our imaginations in such scenes.Some of you will doubtless wonder why I only gave this a nine, if I liked it so much. Simple! I watched the TNT debut of UNDERWORLD, just to refresh my memory. And, I confirmed that it was supposed to take place in a big American city. So, how come everyone is suddenly in Eastern Europe? Are there that many American doctors studying in former Iron Curtain hospitals?That nitpick aside, I will definitely be going to see it a second time. And, if you're smart, so will the rest of you.*How many out there remember him from the Masterpiece Theater mini-series I, CLAUDIUS?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Underworld.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the people that really liked Underworld, but I don't want everyone to think I am giving this a good review just because I liked the first. Underworld Evolution really is better than the original. You can tell Len Wiseman had a bigger budget and a little more experience as a director. The creature effects are better, the action scenes are cooler, and new aspects of the story are revealed. The story picks up directly where the first ended. I suggest watching Underworld again just to refresh your memory. If you like blood and gore, then be happy because there is much more here than in Underworld. Some scenes made the whole audience cringe. Still a good movie that I recommend, especially to the Underworld fans out there. If you aren't an Underworld fan, still give it a try. You may be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, Dark, Intense Action-Horror Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a historical romance about vampires and werewolves with lots of action and Kate Beckinsale in leather. What's not to like about such a flick?Seriously, I really like the historical romance features ... very much in the wonderful tradition of classic horror films tracing back to Frankenstein and Dracula.Acting was exactly adequate to the purpose, although acting as such was hardly more important than plot to this movie. The plot of this kind of movie is far less important than the sense of History, of Story Unfolding. I really loved the cinematography and the overall visual feel of the movie. Throughout we have this sense of overwhelming, all-consuming cold, snowy, icy, rocky, craggy, ruinous darkness. Rust and chains and foggy, wet gloom are everywhere. Through all this world of damp, cold darkness, the action is sustained by a more modern sense of romance between Beckinsale's Selene and her companion. Plus great fight scenes with loads of modern gunfire. For this movie is fast-paced, full of action in the midst of the horror atmospherics. There is some feel of a video game, and some feel of a slasher movie, but one thing there is not: a sense of irony or sardonic humor, the kind that suffuses some of the more campy horror movies these days. This is a big plus in my book.The special effects were superb, and the opening sequence in particular simply wonderful. I haven't seen the original Underworld, I've just gotta find it and check it out. Regardless, this movie clearly stands well on its own.Great flick, gang, check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah the "critics" have panned this movie but most of them hate every movie that is made for the general public (a.k.a. any movie not made for major awards only and only a handful of people ever see it).The visuals were excellent and while there was not a major amount of explosions like most action flicks the audio was beyond perfect. I mean you could hear Kate's vinyl bodysuit squeak in some scenes. While that may seem like an odd thing to say I am sure people would agree that a woman in a skin tight vinyl bodysuit could never move around so much without making a sound (even if she was a vampire). Nothing says sexy like a woman who commands your attention by being completely covered up but shows all her sex appeal.Yeah a few scenes dragged along but those only lasted seconds but otherwise this movie was off the charts. I have not seen a movie so visually stunning since the original "THE CROW". I mean there were effects that made you cringe while wondering "How the heck did they do that?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sure was a ride, some people have commented that the plot has been weakened and that it ruined the world the first created. I would like to ask those people what world this was and what plot they really saw in the first movie. Lets face it this series was really famous because of the subject matter it was dealing with and because of the action it held. This movie has increased each of those categories 10 fold giving all you blood lusters out there exactly what you will want to see. If your looking for a top tier action film go check this one out as it has some of the more creative action scenes/deaths that I've seen in recent history. If you like vampires or werewolves go check this one out because its the only movie where you get to see both at once. If your just plain looking for a good movie with ups and downs and love and explosions then go check this one out. I personally plan to see it again, i cant exactly explain what made it such an experience for me but i know i was not alone, as the entire theatre was gasping and whooping with me. Don't let idiots ruin this one for you, check it out in theater's and enjoy the show, I'm personally hoping for the supposed prequel the director has been talking about! Oh yea and by the way, Kate Beckinsale is just as hott as she ever was.</fullReview>

What I really liked about the first movie was the realistic element of the Lycons. Seeing obvious CGI Lycons was a let down, but I guess it is to be expected in the days of CGI.Kate is once again the shining star. Though she was not known as an action star before Underworld and Van Helsing, she is fantastic in blending acting chops and the ability to physically pull of the role of Selene. She is a little more vulnerable this time around, yet even more powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but still very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd actually give it an 8.5 if I could, or maybe even an 8.9. Underworld 2 was truly an excellent and very entertaining film; but it didn't have the flow and pacing of the first. It just seemed a bit too sporadic to really enjoy fully. Another minor criticism is that too many curve balls and departures from typical Vampire/Lycan lore occurred. The following may or may not be considered a spoiler... There were simply too many deviations from what I personally could readily swallow. The existence of other hybrids (other than Scott Speedman's character), then the revelation of a father figure to all Vampire/Lycans (some super-hybrid himself apparently), and then Selena (Kate Beckinsale's character) supposedly becoming some sort of hybrid herself. It was as if the creators were bored with the original races and wanted to mix it up--but not a little bit, entirely. I would've respected more a less outrageous story. It came off as if they were pissing on all the lore they'd honored and developed in the first one. Annoying. Lycans and Vampires just weren't interesting enough so they had to go and make the story about hybrids.I know I sound like I hated it, but I didn't. Considering how much I could've hated it for all the liberties they took with the fascinating lore of Vampires and Lycans (a good example would be the butchering of mythology or history that Disney sometimes does to make it fit the story they want to tell more conveniently), I still really enjoyed it. Visually, it was incredible. The effects--by and large--were outstanding, the set designs sumptuous, and the direction superb. The dialogue was also good. Most of the problems I'm grousing about were underlying screenplay structure and story idea problems. All that to say that I still consider the first to be the best. However, my guess, if you enjoyed the first you'll probably enjoy the second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie for Kate Beckinsale and that's about it. What we got was a fairly interesting, well-paced followup to the events of Underworld, much more convincing action (specifically, I appreciated their not repeating the mistake of having vampires just stand there snarling as Lycans transformed right in front of them and proceeded to beat the crap out of them, as in the first movie), a more interesting villain, and a plot that someone actually sat down and thought about for a few minutes. Also, a goodly length Beckinsale love scene, my fellow males :). Much better than I expected, much better than the first. I'd say it's somewhere between a 6 and 7, and in trying to get past my prejudice from the first movie's crappiness (because this one really doesn't deserve it), Evolution gets the benefit of the doubt, a 7 it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...in Memphis, TN, with my girlfriend and several friends from our local goth club. You may take from that what you will as far as pre-conceptions go. I enjoyed the first movie, and expected to enjoy this one--I was not disappointed.The story picks up moments after the end of the first movie, and the pace is almost frantic as events unfold. It needs to be. I marked off for the screenplay raising more questions than it answers, with the extrapolatable timeline being very tight, and full of loopholes/pitfalls. The introduction of the archivist allowed for some important backstory to be filled in, as do the many flashbacks throughout the movie. Oh, if you are like me, and despise the character of Kraven, then you will be pleased--'nuff said...:-) If you enjoyed the acting in the first movie, you will enjoy it in this one--similar performances all-around. Contrari-wise, if you hated it, but still feel compelled to see this installment, I doubt you will have your opinion changed.I marked off for a basically gratuitous sex-scene between Michael and Selene, as I felt it could have been handled much better. One aspect I liked from the first movie is that the female protagonist (Kate Beckinsale) was clothed throughout it--something of a rare bird in today's Hollywood.The visuals are top-notch--period. Solid CGI, good action (even if a few moments are expanded a bit for some "take that you fiend" dialog, which doesn't add much, but at least doesn't detract), and the costumes what you come expecting to see (or not see, as the case may be ;-). The weakest part I could see is the armor worn in the 1202 A.D. combat-scene, and so very few movies bother with historical accuracy in this area that I feel it appropriate to suspend disbelief in light of the effort shown in this movie--not perfect, but passable enough with some shadows and mirrors.It ends with an almost guaranteed third movie hinted at, and given the questions left open in this one I hope they make it soon--I'll be there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is certainly worth the price of admission...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NO SPOILERS)UNDERWORLD was a hugely successful movie that was rooted in MATRIX sensibilities, or perhaps even those of BLADE. I wasn't a huge fan, but I did think it had enough potential to keep it interesting, and I grew to respect it as a low budget movie that made the most of its extremely modest means. All said and done, it was a 'B' movie that postured (confidently) as an 'A'. What it lacked in scope, it made up for with Kate in black leather. Great effort produced a slightly better than average film, and that of course (inevitably) produced the sequel, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION.The cast of the first film returns for another installment, and this film most definitely treads safely in the 'sequels that are better than the original' waters. 'Evolution' is the story of where the two warring factions of vampires and werewolves come from, why they fight, and where their future lies. It's also an evolution of the relationship between a vampire, Selene (Beckinsale) and a vampire/werewolf hybrid, Michael (Speedman). This film picks up right where the original left off.While this movie is still a 'B' posturing as an 'A', it is most certainly bigger and better. Where the first film lags occasionally due to a two hour running time, this one cooks at just under an hour and forty. The new cast members are solid, and make the most with what they've got to work with, which isn't bad. What prevents the film from elevating itself any higher is a relatively weak story. The dialogue is passable and often interesting in that it suggests character traits and past actions that are not shown on screen. In addition, what isn't spoken is equally revealing/ interesting at times. Unfortunately though, the story is only average. Most of the time it serves only to get our players from one action sequence to the next, relying heavily on flashbacks. (Though there is more meat here than in the first film) The question is: is there enough here to peak your curiosity, give you something to think about, and maintain a certain level of say...audience commitment for 96 minutes? My answer...yes, I think there is, and here is why.What it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in presentation. I tend to look at a film like this for what it is. It's an action/ horror/ fantasy movie about warring factions of vampires and werewolves, and as such, it should deliver the goods. This film does. The visual effects are top notch, many of which will go unnoticed. (Seemlessness is always a good thing in VFX, and there are very few misfires in this film.) I also like the fight sequences. While they may not be as grandiose as those of the 'Crouching Tiger' variety, they are not without style and character. Michael's battles are absolutely brutal, while Selene's are more finessed. (Marcus, played by Tony Curran, is an absolute wrecking machine.) UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is dirty, grimy, and bloody. (Absolutely freaking Bloody) There is more than enough carnage to satisfy fans of the genre. A film like this should know its place, know its core audience, live in its world, and deliver (in full) on all accounts. UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION (for the most part) achieves that. Will it bring in any new fans? Who knows, but I think it might. It's action packed, extremely violent, and much more sexy than the original. It may not leave a lasting impression on it's audience, but it is certainly worth the price of admission...which is more than can be said for a lot of movies these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love vampires, and you love genealogy, this is for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of shooting, growling, and roaring happens in "Underworld: Evolution." This second installment of the centuries-old war between werewolves ("Lycans") and vampires ("Vampires") evidently picks up right where the entirely forgettable first part ended. Director Len Wiseman seems to appreciate that the particulars of the first film may not be so fresh in our minds, and helpfully includes a flashback montage that, I believe, is actually the entire first movie in fast forward. And there's still all of this one to get through. It's like an unintended double feature."Underworld: Evolution" opens in the 13th century, in what appears to be a department store Christmas village set. Vampires and Lycans fought then, too, but the vamps then wore "Lord of the Rings"-style chunky armor with nose pieces, rather than skin-tight leather. Right about here - that is, the beginning - I stopped knowing or caring just what the hell was going on. This film delves so absurdly deep into monster genealogy that one so inclined to be concerned with it all would need a flow chart to keep up.We rejoin the pale yet comely Selene (Kate Beckinsale) from part one, on the run with her ally Michael (Scott Speedman), who is coming to grips with the fact that he's a new, evolved breed of wolf/vamp, with the happy result that he occasionally turns blue and grows long fingernails. Selene is intent on waking up original elder vampire Marcus from his tomb to catch him up on all of part one's treachery. Turns out that Marcus has already gotten up, though, and himself is intent on eating Selene, because her "blood memory" contains the location of the eternal prison of his brother William, the original Lycan. Marcus wants to free him. Also, their father is still alive, and lives on a ship with an army. Or something. At this point, some questions may occur to you, such as:1. How come one brother was a wolf and one a vampire? 2. Doesn't blood constantly regenerate itself? How can it have a memory? 3. Did the effects team from "Land of the Lost" also work on this film?The answers, as far as I can tell, are:1. Because 2. This is VAMPIRE blood, remember 3. It appears so.Surprisingly, though, "Underworld: Evolution" isn't as bad as the above implies. True, family trees are only interesting if they're your own (and usually not even then), and the film showcases the same goofy effects from its predecessor, but there's no denying that both films have a stylishness about them. The winged Marcus, whose appendages are weapons as much as transport, is a superior villain to the punky wolf and geriatric vamp of "Underworld," and the movie mostly keeps moving, making comprehension of its finer points utterly unnecessary. "Underworld: Evolution" contains some mumbo-jumbo to the effect that killing Marcus and William, the progenitors of their species, would destroy their entire lines. So by the end, when they're all chopped up and such, and Selene's voice-over starts talking about more battles ahead, we're again reassured that it's fine to just watch these films without any understanding of what they're about. Maybe it will all get cleared up in "Underworld: Intelligent Design."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen the original, but persuaded by a friend to take a peak because he'd enjoyed it, I have to say I haven't spent such a balls-achingly tedious time in the cinema for many a year. This from a man who has sat through three Pokemon movies with his children! Now, I realise that many will say that not having seen the original I clearly didn't understand the sequel. Please, grant me some intelligence. I caught up with Lost's first season just by watching the last two episodes. Given there was so much exposition from Tanis (Steven Mackintosh: the only performer on show to do more than phone in a performance), alongside the plethora of flashback, playing catchup wasn't difficult.The biggest problem was: why? Why, when vampires and werewolves are at war, does the king of the vamps want to release his lycanthropic twin? Why is Corvinus - portrayed by the slumbering Derek Jacobi - so easy to kill? The geezer's an immortal! More importantly, why - when Selene sucks from Corvinus' blood (told that she will become something more - clearly this is the "evolution" of the title) do we get a girlish licking at his slit wrist and no clear effect? Every time any other character has sucked on another's blood they received the memories of their victim (it's a great notion, blood as inheritance as memory - but it's not thought through). But here - where she's taking the last drops from the grand-daddy of all the warring monsters what do we get? Nothing! This from a film that throws in the kitchen sink (or a helicopter) to mask the gaping plot holes.Stilted dialogue, charmless characters, appalling editing, and sexless sex scenes all mark this out as a sequel too far (one!) God help us if there's an Underworld 3! Ignore the adolescent fan-boys gurgling over Ms Beckinsale on this site - this vampire flick is more "drek" than "Dracula".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Underworld, as many have said, had an original flavor ? graduated from the gimmicks of Hollywood "let's make this marketable!" attitude. The story showed a phenomenal amount of character depth for the genre (action fantasy), and ended with a cliffhanger that left us drooling for more.Cut to the sequel. In this story, the depth of character is sacrificed for more gosh-wow and special effects. The respect that the first movie held for "absorbing one's memories" has turned into a trifle tool. The characters, Selene and Michael, have turned into two dimensional characters. Markus is a single-minded "villain" as well. I didn't understand why he was a villain in the first place. Each of these people are set in one attitude and path through to the end, which makes for a more boring plot.On the plus side, incredible graphics and action sequences. If only they had this kind of budget and flair in the last one.I was sorely disappointed by Evolution. It forgot the philosophy that makes movies of this nature timeless, that is ? the fine balance between depth of story and the relevance of the action.Once an hour into the movie, I realized that nothing had really changed. The direness of the conflict was not set in stone. I felt no real sympathy for the plight of the main characters ?&nbsp;and there are a few plot holes that are hard to pass up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love this movie as much as the original. Kate is great and the action sequences are just awesome. The story was great and filled in a lot of unanswered questions from Underworld. Other reasons I loved this movie was that it finally told us the whole background of Selene and the origin of the Vampires and Lycans. The one thing I think they could have done, is not use so much graphic gore. I don't mind some realistic violence/gore, but some movies go too far. The main villain, Markus (played by Tony Curran I believe) was great. He also played Priest in Blade 2, another great movie. I really like the fact that Kate is a good enough actress to pull of being a strong female lead. As for the rest of the cast, they do a superb job as well as the special effects. The Lycans effects were very good and the Lycans looked very realistic. I am wondering if there is a 3rd movie, what will the story be. Maybe the offspring of Selene and Michael? I can hardly wait for the DVD in unrated form to come out later this year. This is definitely a movie worth seeing again and buying on DVD. I am hoping for a 3rd movie and hope it will continue the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Evolution: The war has evolved but has the influence from other movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Len Wiseman's Underworld Evolution is, unlike most sequels, better than the first. The movie opens with vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and hybrid warrior Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) anticipating the awakening of Marcus (Tony Curran). We learn in UE about the characters' pasts and they, shockingly, have many twists and turns. We find that Selene's induction into the vampire family wasn't as it seemed in the original Underworld. Underworld Evolution, surprisingly, earns its "R" rating. The special effects have definitely evolved since the original debuted in 2003. There is more blood and gore than ever before. This movie contains a sex scene that has every characteristic of a porno except the cheesy dialogue. Though the storyline war between vampires and werewolf-evolved Lycans is original, the movie parallels numerous others. Marcus transforms into a monster that sadly resembles that of Jeepers Creepers 2. The characters adopted the same black leather wardrobe as the cast of The Matrix trilogy. This Romeo and Juliet storyline ends somewhat differently ? happily. The movie ends with Selene narrating. She looks "to the future with hope" just as Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2.I give this sequel a 'B' rating because I dislike how the final fight scene plays out. Other than that, it was a great success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once, a decent sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good film. I won't say a great film but certainly worth seeing.Picks up well from where the first left off and the impressive introduction and fast but well paced flashbacks nicely tell the story so you don't need to rent out the first film before seeing it.The action is literally wall-to-wall and start to finish. There are few moments when the screen isn't full of fights, gun-play and monsters. Just the way we like it! The use of CGI is very subtle for the most part and some scenes have been made perfect with the use of animatronics and real life set pieces instead of the usual CGI action that actually bores me these days.The acting is very good for the most part but the actors don't really have much to work with. The actual amount of talking in the film could be written on a few sides of A4. This is a film that lets a picture tell a thousand words and it does it well.While bloody and gory, it is never excessive or over the top. Unlike other films that just add more blood instead of proper plot, this one delivers visceral reality for fights between powerful supernatural creatures.On the downside, a few of the location changes are tenuous at best, impossible at worst. Also, the lack of dialogue does make it seem like the talking's only there to fill in time before the next fight scene.Altogether though, a good film in it's own right and a great sequel. Can't wait for the third!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money, this movie has no plot, cheesy acting and so-so special effects. I don't think anyone could possibly enjoy this film. The worst thing about this movie is that it takes itself seriously...if it was a "Horror-Comedy-Action" film, it might have earned a "3" rating but as it stands, this movie is just lucky that the ratings don't go below zero! The one redeeming quality of this film is its cast of B+ list actors including Kate Beckensale, who is very pleasing to the eye. Unfortunately, she is cast in a movie without a plot, character development, or a screen writer who has a grasp of the English language. Whatever you do......do not go see this movie, read a book instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced exciting vampire/werewolf battle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 1/20/2006, 7 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Fast-paced exciting vampire/werewolf battle with Kate Beckinsale doing an excellent job as the vampiress heroine. If you can get thru the gory/bloody details in the fight scenes you will enjoy this adult-oriented adaptation of the video game, part 2. After watching this sequel, I'll probably go back and watch the original to help me fill in the pieces because this movie was definitely harder to follow when you hadn't seen the first. Beckinsale if wonderful in this role and the rest of the cast do a good job in portraying this other-worldly underworld. This is an effects-loaded movie that doesn't let that get in the way. The story is at the forefront despite this, although most of the characters are not completely developed but this may again have to do with not seeing the original. I personally think a television show is forthcoming due to the complexity of the story and what can be explored in this unique setting. I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the story because, #1 - I'll probably get some of it wrong, and #2 - the actions is what sells the movie to me. If your looking for a fun-filled action packed film with a great leading lady who can pull off sweetness &amp; toughness then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreadful film devoid of any entertainment value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1 is probably too high for this excrement. I could not see one redeeming feature. It wasn't even laughable. The effects were so poor that the werewolves occasionally changed into silver grey teddy bears. The dialogue made no sense at all, if it was meant to explain the so-called "plot" it failed miserably. I have just returned from the cinema and apart from Johnny English this the only time I considered walking out of the cinema since there was nothing to keep me there apart from the warmth on a cold winter's evening. Fortunately I do not pay for my tickets as I buy a season, otherwise I would have been tempted to demand a refund. How on earth a renowned actor like Derek Jacobi could have agreed to take part in this laughable travesty of a movie defies imagination, he must be getting his pension together. A totally wasted evening, should have stayed in and watched Big Brother, even that would have been preferable. No risk of any plot spoilers here, it was ruined already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first one had brains, this one has brawn. Not bad, though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As horror/action/monster movies go, this is one of the good ones. I found myself thinking of the Alien saga watching it. Of course, as Alien 1 presented one creature, its life circle, its motivation, the second was with marines shooting at a lot of angry aliens. Such is the "evolution" of Underworld. The sequel is so action packed that it leaves very little space for plot. The story is thus reduced to Lichen/Vampire level 3 battles with Lichen/Vampire level 2, while the poor level 1 creatures from the first film are way weak and powerless.Sounds like a video game? Well, it sure feels like it. I just hope that, as with Alien, the brain will return to the story, like in Alien Resurrection. Else, all is lost. Kate Beckinsale already has a boyfriend one does not want to mess around with and the bad guys are all gone, even the big and scary ones, so another more evil and more powerful would just push it too far, like poor Blade 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evolution Can't Save This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A more appropriate title for this movie could be: THE WORLD IN BLUE (Why? Everything is filmed in blue light. Except sex.) Or better yet the title should be: THE MOVIE THAT BEGINS THREE TIMES (1.First it begins in 1202 AD, 2.then it cuts to to montage/flashback of clips from the last movie for review, 3.then, after the title is displayed, it begins again in present time. Actually it really begins 15-20 minutes after that. They should have cut at least the first half hour and put more money into story development and its execution than was put into the gallons of blood that added nothing to what little story there was story.)Typically, it is understood in the movie industry, that basically a story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION has 3 beginnings, and one long middle and then stops. This movie is a waste of money, time and film. What happened to the Len Wiseman who made the first UNDERWORLD film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smacks of Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must firstly admit that I am not the biggest fan of the first movie. I thought it had amazing potential to succeed, but I thought it was squandered away by taking the cheap way out every chance it could. Despite this, it sits in my DVD collection and manages to find its way into my DVD player from time to time.That said...The sequel was pure dreck.It seems that upon paying $10 we are greeted to a constant series of plot holes and logic gaps.Gone is are the sleek visuals of the original with their overtones of white blue and black... replaced with what look like shots from any other film. In the films opening sequence, I felt like I was watching the armies of Isoldor battling Orcs instead of a historical battle between vampire and lycan. During several scenes I thought perhaps we were being shown a misplaced reel from a Tom Clancy film.While the first film had its fare share of head scratching moments.. the second leaves you completely flummoxed more often than not. For instance, Selene and Micheal seem to not only visit an exile, but drive to the coast and take off to into the mountains all in the expanse of one night making you think perhaps we have entered the movie Dark City. Selenes gloves dissolve in the sunlight, but her exposed skin is relatively untouched. A man who gets shot... not bitten mind you... but shot... becomes a lycan! A lycan is killed by being stabbed in the eye... another dies from a shot by one of the vampire killing UV bullets! Also, where does Micheals shirt go? Every time he goes through his transformations.. his shirt just vanishes. He removes his jacket, but his shirt is just gone.We are also greeted with plot points that try to explain things we didn't need answers to- Memories of things we saw in the first movie seem to only show up now instead of when the item inspiring the memory is first introduced. We find out who is cleaning up the bodies the war leaves behind... never mind that in the first movie the carnage spilled into the streets in plain view of mortals... they have to hide the bodies and pretend it never happened.Also, despite the way the original film ended, and what we're told early on in Evolution, there's no proof what so ever that anything has changed in Marcus. Marcus simply wakes and is angry over something that happened hundreds of years ago, making you wonder why all of this didn't happen the last time Marcus was awakened.So.. you're probably wondering... was there anything worthwhile in the film? Well.... I'm not sure. The visual effects were lackluster, the acting was hammy, the dialogue was stilted, the ending wasn't spectacular (and left me feeling like someone had watched Raiders of the Lost Ark a few more times than they should have while penning the script.) and the hints at a 3rd installment elicited a groan from me and several others in the theater.However... no... no I can't really think of a however to contradict all of the bad things I've listed.So, if you want a movie thats as well written as the menu in a Chinese restaurant with effects that remind you of something produced direct to video and is more derivative than such miraculous works as 2 Fast 2 Furious and League of Extrordinary Gentlemen... than Underworld: Evolution is definitely the movie for you.If you're looking for a good vampire movie, however, or even a movie written by a competent scribe or directed by someone with some strength behind the camera.. steer clear. Please dear god, steer clear.</fullReview>

The action scenes are phenomenal, especially if you enjoy Beretta 92FS fully modified for automatic fire. What ever happened to the theory that vampires do not cast shadows, and vampires can only be killed by direct sunlight exposure or a wooden stake through the heart. Are we re-writing the rules?? What about vampires being able to transform into other creatures and fly?? Looking forward to Evolution as well as Retribution. Any idea on the release date for the DVD??

Of course this is not a MASTERPIECE it has a lot of its own flaw...well considering the subject tackled was a war between vampires vs. werewolves vs. human. Do not expect The Godfather...or Forrest Gump. However having said all of this Underworld has done very well and I am sure to watch the third sequel in the years to come.

		<fullReview>This was AMAZING! I went to see it at the first showing at the theater when everyone was at work and school to avoid crowds. I have to say that this movie is much better than the first, and I still love the first. But it gives you the whole back story on the war and shows you the first Vampire and first Werewolf. You also see more about Selene's past and WHY she got turned into a Vampire, and there's more reason than just reminding Viktor of his daughter. The effects were amazing and the plot twists were great, just everything you weren't expecting. There was a lot of blood so if you don't like that this probably isn't your movie. But this is still a must see! I recommend it strongly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare to see a sequel that is anywhere near the quality of the first film. This is one of those rare movies, it really is even better than the first.About half way through the movie I realized that there was nothing that I immediately said "oh jeez, that's fake". Nothing. Everything looked 100% real to me, though perhaps after a second viewing some things will come to attention. Overall, just beautiful effects. I doubt very much that all the werewolves where makeup, in face, I'd say none of them where. The movement was just to realistic, the way they crunched into their prey...to be honest, there are some very shocking scenes in this film.In Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Art you see a little bit of a red mist when a guy gets ripped up by an airplane blade. In Underworld Evolution, you see one of the many monsters shoved directly into a crashed helicopter blade, torn to bits. And it looks real.I agree with a previous reviewer about the scene involving a flying creature (I won't give away who it is) pursuing Michael and Selene who are in a truck. This really, really looks like there is real monster flying around the truck. There is nothing to give it away as computer graphics. This carries over to the rest of the film in that I have no idea what shots where CG and which where makeup, etc. You really cannot tell.Amazing graphics, interesting story, good character development, surprising twists, great pacing. Over all, this is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to say too much in fear of saying...well...too much. I think overall they did a good job with this sequel. I was not completely thrilled and amazed, but the story stayed pretty strong throughout the movie. There were, however, some pivotal, high-adrenaline parts to it. The end left me speechless.Once again, as in the first one, the characters were made up and designed amazingly. The chemistry was shaky between Michael and Selene, but under the circumstance of impending doom how much time should be wasted on their relationship? The sex scene that everyone else has mentioned was well-shot and a nice transition, although it was a little too in-depth for me, and yes of course I wanted to see Kate Beckinsale's ta-tas...o well.The fight scenes were good, although not overly thrilling. The highly-anticipated truck scene was kinda a let down. It wasn't long at all. Although, like I said, I was not completely thrilled and amazed, they played out the story ever-so-perfectly and did not butcher this sequel. Go see it!Oh and yes...how could I forget...the stupid questions that people will ask.No, not better than the original, but not worse either. (haha...figure it out for yourself) Yes, Tanis' women have nice boobies.And no, no concrete signs of a sequel and/or prequel.-Peace-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No better, but No worse. What I call sequel success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, my favorite things that happens in this movie is Kraven (Shane Brolly) is killed within minutes of it starting. He has always stood out as the worst part of the first film and I was dreading another ninety minutes of that character moping around the neo-Gothic mansion whining about not being in power. Now, to get more into what actually transpires in this highly anticipated sequel, at least by me, it runs like a mixture between sequel and prequel due to a heavy amount of flashbacks helping to further explain Selene's (Kate Beckinsale) role in the foundation of the Vampire clan. Her and Michael (Scott Speedman) finally get to get it on this time, which Scott admitted to being very weird since Kate's husband is the director. Just like the last film, this one practically lives in the blue/black nighttime zone and has lots of Kate walking around in her perfectly cut black plastic Death Dealer outfit, but what this particular installment embellishes on in the realm of gore, it seems to fall behind in the realm of cool. The first film had a bit more attitude with Kate and Lucian's characters that made them, as my friends are fond of saying these days, "badassssss", but here in "Underworld: Evolution" I found that missing in favor of showing off brute strength by a number of heads being torn off by the jaw and other such coyness. All in all I would not put one film over the other, which in the realm of sequels is highly considered a success.</fullReview>

Kate Beckinsale is a gorgeous actress with talent to boot and once again plays the role of Selene with passion. It was just a wonderful move that I recommend to anyone who like the first one,this was 10 fold better and the first one was awesome. This is also a much darker movie carrying a hefty and unwarranted 18A warning. Selene and Micheal find themselves fighting for their lives after Markus is awaken as a hybrid through the blood of the slain Lycan doctor in the first movie. Markus sets out in a quest to find his brother William the first of the werewolves. It is an epic battle with lots of action and gore. The evolution of Selene and Micheal are really well done as they become lovers and share a really passionate scene in a storage container. Also we learn Selene's past and why her family was killed. Once again, an awesome movie with a great cast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Underworld: Evolution' Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to 2003's 'Underworld' continues the story of the war between vampires and werewolves known as Lycans. The film follows Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer presumed to be a traitor to her coven, and Michael (Speedman), a werewolf/vampire hybrid and Syrene's only current ally. Selene and Michael must face off against Marcus (Tony Curran), the very first vampire, as he searches for William, Marcus' brother and the very first Lycan.'Underworld: Evolution,' as well as its predecessor, falls into an odd territory. Critically speaking, the movie lacks a lot. The story is interesting, even if it lacks originality. But the acting is mediocre and the directing is poorly done at times. The special effects, while done very well at most points, look terrible at other points (primarily when Lycans are going into werewolf form). While the script manages to highlight the background of the story and characters, sometimes it feels like it's just there to fill in scenes when there's no fighting.Yet even with all these critical downfalls, 'Underworld: Evolution' remains entertaining. The action-packed fight scenes are terrific, and the story has enough of a sense of mystery to keep you wanting more. Kate Beckinsale may not be the greatest actress, but she knows how to kick serious Lycan tail while remaining wonderfully hot. And it's great to see Speedman getting to try out the role of Michael some more as he gets more fighting time to try out his unique abilities.The real acting gem, though, is Tony Curran as Marcus. Though he spends a majority of his screen time in serious make-up, his line delivery is wonderful. And during the points that he is on screen without the vampiric effects, he emits an evil feeling making his character the most believable of all of them.Overall, don't go to the film expecting a wonderfully made movie. Go to it to enjoy yourself. I consider both 'Underworld' films to be guilty pleasures, something to enjoy simply for their entertainment value. And that is one thing that this movie really does have a lot of!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great scifi/action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this film is not garnering praise from critics, but there's nothing new in that scenario. If it doesn't involve politics, gay love (not that I'm anti), or campy dating humor, why bother, huh? NOT! This movie does an excellent job of picking up where the first left off, and with this one taking place over only a couple of days (like the first one), the story and action seem exceptionally dynamic. Oh, and is there ever action. From opening sequence to credits, this film will keep you wincing, gasping, and twitching. If you're squeamish, save your bucks, but if you want to see what it would really be like should vampires and werewolves face off, then definitely RUN to the theater, because this is no-holds-barred war. As far as the sex scene being called"soft porn", there are no anatomical displays, and folks, this movie IS RATED R. In other words, for adults. If you're an adult and can't handle a little skin, then stay home and play MadGabs with the kiddies or something. I mean, don't we all express love and passion in that manner? Hmmm. Anyway, overall this is a must-see for scifi and sci-fantasy fans, and if you liked the first one, this shouldn't disappoint. Coupled with A-plus directing and cinematography, I just don't feel you can go wrong for sheer entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Better Than Revenge of the Stith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics are writing this movie off because they simply don't like the genre. Although the action at times overshadows the very fine acting by Beckinsale and Speedman, Underworld 2: Evolution is an outstanding cinematic achievement, both in the horror-fantasy and action genres. This is especially true for a sequel. The casting is perfect and the mythical world Wiseman and company create is logically consistent and highly entertaining. Underworld easily outdoes the latest Star Wars entry: the relationships and dialogue are more mature and lively, the fantasy world is drawn with more forethought and in greater detail, and the directing is geared more for adults than adolescents. The plotting of this movie is clever and doesn't hold back in borrowing from Greek mythology and Shakespeare. I would give Revenge of the Stith, its childlike dialogue and wooden character sketches, two stars, and Underworld 2 three and one-half stars. Once you take out brand name and the infatuation critics have for George Lucas, it's easy to see the creators of Stith could learn a great deal from Len Wiseman and Danny McBride when it comes to making fantasy for adults.

		<shortDescription>brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i thought underworld evolution was amazing, the amount of gore in it was brilliant, I'm a fan of blood and guts. i liked how Michael was able to just rip the jaw off of Lycans, however i was disappointed at the strength of Marcus in the final battle, as i expected him to be significantly stronger, faster and better in general.best film i have seen so far this year... this is out of Just Friends, Jarhead and Man On Fire. Hopefully there will be an Underworld 3 as they left it open for it, but also made it end just enough so if they decide otherwise it finishes well.If there is an Underworld 3 I'm hoping Cate Beckinsale has those same Blue contact lenses. They were definitely one of the highlights of the film for me and all my friends. Even the girls acknowledged the pure genius and beauty behind them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the first Underworld, I was 100% positive of one thing, this would spawn at least two sequels. The first film sets up a major and epic tale of lies and deception, that lead all the way back to the beginning of all immortals, whether Vampire or Lycan. The beginning of this film sets back to the dark ages, in which the newly set up Vampire army, lead by Viktor (Bill Nighy) and Marcus (Tony Curran) face a deadly enemy in the form of William, the first Lycan and brother to Marcus. William, unlike other Lycan, cannot return to human form, and is more vicious than any other Lycan after him. Viktor orders William to be imprisoned for all time, far away from his bleeding hearted brother. All of this, of course, occurring the very same night in which Selene's (Kate Beckinsale) parents are murdered, and her quest for vengeance begins. The film then picks up where it left off, with Viktor, Amelia, and Lucian dead, Kraven escaped, Marcus awoken, and Selene and Michael on the run.Things are not all well, Michael is now a hybrid, and he is uncertain of what lies ahead. Marcus, the most powerful of all vampires is also a hybrid, due to the blood spilt by Singe (Erwin Leder) at the hands of Viktor; Marcus is now more powerful than ever. After executing the traitorous Kraven (Shane Brolly), Marcus feeds on his blood to learn what has transpired in the last few hours, his result sends him into a rage. The mystery becomes even more unclear when two important medallions, one worn by Lucian then handed over to Michael, and one hidden within the chest of Viktor's corpse spark the interest of Marcus, and the mysterious Lorenz MacKarrow (Derek Jacobi).Selene and Michael interrogate the exiled, smarmy, and overly sexual vampire historian Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), to whatever information he has been keeping locked away for the last few centuries. He reveals that Marcus is the first true vampire, not Viktor as everyone was lead to believe, and that the tale of Alexander Corvinus and the three sons (one bitten by bat, one by wolf, and one to walk the lonely road of mortality) is, in fact, true. Tanis then sends the two heroes the way of Lorenz MacKarrow, who is revealed to be the father of all immortals?Alexander Corvinus. From the confrontation between Marcus and Corvinus, to the final battle between Selene, Michael, Marcus, and William, this film is exciting through and through. With the visual effects, costume and set designs improved ten fold from its predecessor, this movie more than lives up to the original. Once again garnished with awesome performances, including original players like Kate Beckisnale, Scott Speedman, Shane Brolly, and Bill Nighy, along with newcomers Steven Mackinstosh, Tony Curran, and Derek Jacobi. Curran delivers one of the most forceful and villainous performances I have ever seen. His Marcus is more violent and physical than Nighy's suave and intimidating Viktor, yet he also adds more of a complexity to his character as well, mostly concerning the love for his brother. Jacobi gives a sterling and powerful performance as the immortal Alexander Corvinus, who steals most of the film away. It was also a pleasure to see Bill Nighy returning to the role of Viktor in a brief but sensational cameo. Overall this film is a perfect blend of action and good story telling, with a solid plot line, brilliant performances, and dazzling special effects to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much different from the first, but definitely better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very good indeed. I personally loved it. It had the same feeling that the first one had, but contained in my opinion, much more gore and, well, sexual tension. I was entranced the entire time, though I had to shield my eyes for brief times because of the gore and such. After the movie was over I just wanted to sit there and watch it all over again. If you loved the first one, you will for sure love this one. Though time and time again I was forced to hold back tears in the end it's kinda a happy ending, depending on the view point. But if you're squeamish before blood, and immature to adult content, you should rather just wait for it to come out on DVD/VHS. After all I did not think I wasted any of my money and it was a time well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>less blue than the first (bigger budget)...a few continuity errors (broken windows and dented cars), other than that very good. needs a bit more character build up...faster, more intense is the name of the game. the special effects are still amazing, very believable...Wiseman always surprises and surpasses expectations, especially with this one. dialog is a bit thin, but really, what can you possibly expect from a horror action movie? this is a movie worth seeing a few times, pure entertainment with a hint of depth. the introduction of an array of characters (both mentioned and not mentioned in the first) provide color and action to this sequel. Note: from beginning to end there is constant motion, something is always going on. there is no boring part, the pace is fast before the opening credits. oh, and the trailers included with the film are worth paying admission for in themselves (X3, silent hill, stay alive). prepare to enter the theater to be entertained and to leave very satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than what I'd heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first Underworld film when it first came out and loved it. Then I heard about the possibility of a second one, and I've just been to see it today at the cinema. I'd been in town with some friends prior to going to see the film and they were all telling me it was rubbish, and the ones who hadn't seen it but didn't like the first one were telling me it'd be crap. In my opinion, it wasn't. I thought it was good, all of the characters from the first film that were alive were in this one rather than the sequels where they have different actors. I thought the Marcus monster-bat was awesome, and the way that they buffed and bad-assed up William was pretty good too. All in all, I give it a 10/10. Not to say everyone who watches this film will love it, but it's my opinion of the film, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved underworld evolution, bottom line it was a great sequel to the first. I loved the first one so much i went the day the 2nd opened and went out and bought the first one as well. I loved the storyline especially the growing love between Selene and Michael. The action sequences were well choreographed, just as the first. The plot twists were amazing just as the first film i was thinking throughout the entire move of the whole story and left the movie theater thinking more, trying to go over in my head the complete story now that evolution revealed the secrets the first underworld left. Having the lead character Selene being a woman made it even BETTER. The role could of easily been played by a man but having the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale play the role made the film even more sleek and sexy!! The whole romeo and Juliette feel to it was spectacular and I truly hope that the Len Wiseman decides to bring audiences back to underworld in the 3rd movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale really preformed to my expectations again. You can tell the entire cast put their all into making the sequel at least as good as the first Underworld.I admit it dragged a few minutes in the last third, but all in all I was impressed.I liked the special effects, they were a little blocky in some of the fight scene movements, but putting together the scene in a fluid movement with such great 3d rendering would have meant the movie would still be in production. I won't think twice about Recommending this film to all my friends!I might be wrong but they kind of left it open for #3 at the end.One can only wish that they put their hearts into the next if any, as they did the first two.I didn't time the movie but it seemed around 1:40 or so by the time I got into my car after leaving the theater.Micheal, played by Scott Speedman matures quickly midway into the plot and holds his own in the end. A great job of character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sets a reliable trend for the Underworld series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it succinctly this a great action/monster/fantasy/scifi flick. If you like the raw battles of the first one, then you will probably like this one even more.The original Underworld leaves you hanging with the pending vampire retribution after Selene kills Viktor. This movie settles most of these questions, and more, giving some history of the Lycan/Vampire ancestry and focusing on key characters in that lineage. Evolution continues its vampire vision color scheme, and generally seems to be a well conceived film. It lays out a lot of interesting details that profoundly encapsulate the Underworld mythology.When you go to this movie, you will see the dynamic duo, Selene and Michael, in action. They will take on Godly foes, and bands of Lycans on their quest of survival. New adversaries will emerge that put Viktor and Craven to shame. Selene's struggle in Evolution has more apocalyptic implications that go beyond Vampire/Lycan power struggles.Most films leave a little room for a sequel, and this one is no exception, so hopefully they will carry this winning formula to a future chapter in Underworld. Go and see this excellent picture. As far as I can see there isn't a bothersome thing about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is very catchy, the action scenes are realized really precisely, and the scene where Selene and Michael make love is full of erotic energy and tenderness.It's perfect.I loved this movie. Hope you will too. "Underworld : Evolution" does not quite continue the story in Underworld, because if the werewolves rages were so dangerous and couldn't turn back into humans, how did Lucien fell in love with Viktor'd daughter and had an affair with her ?? From what I can understand between Whilliam's imprisonment and Selene's turning into vampire is a too little difference for werewolves rages to evolve.(about 10 years ?)A little mistake I guess, but it doesn't affect in any mode the magnificent movie that "Underworld : Evolution".Hope you will enjoy'it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to say that Kate is awesome as Selene and is perfect for the part. I would go out on a limb and say that this is the best Vampire movie ever made and would definitely pay full price to see it for a third time. It was nice to see Craven killed off before any horrible inappropriate acting ensued. The first film should have done the same. Excellent use of a helicopter rotor blades. The only gripe is that I would have liked to see a more realistic winged vampire. More research into the physics of winged creatures would have helped but other than that I'd have to say it was better than the first and would definitely like to see a DVD directors cut version. Acting, Effects, and story were appropriate but flash backs were some what distracting if you saw the first movie.</fullReview>

Having said that I didn't once feel the need to look at my watch and was kept thoroughly entertained throughout. I urge each and everyone of you to go and see this film, but don't just watch it 'cos Brokeback Mountain is sold out, you wont enjoy it that context, go and spend two hours watching a film which has been well put together and requires nothing but your attendance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see the movie, I was hoping for an epic film, but all I was expecting was another regular old sequel. Without a doubt this is better then the first! In the first film you touch on events that happened throughout Selene's Past. This film goes in depth and explains everything. I was very pleased with this sequel, it stayed true to the style and overall feel of the original Underworld, but throws in a great story and some intense action.The computer graphics were done really well, and the animated wolves moved very realistically. The script and acting was excellent as well. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole film.The events unfolded well, and might surprise you in a few spots. So if you haven't seen this movie, I personally, as well as the friends i saw it with highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to say this movie is basically a flop. The new characters were not fully developed, and it was too long and drawn out. This movie is actually a prequel not a sequel. The story on a whole didn't make any sense. There was hardly any action except at the end. The movie reminded me of the Matrix if it was drawn out and made by high school film majors on a limited budget shot with a camcorder. It was actually so boring that I fell asleep constantly. Rather than spend ten dollars to see underworld I would spend twenty dollars to see the original Blair Witch Project. My opinion save your money for something worthy to come to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, which I anticipated with some level of excitement, on opening day with mediocre expectations. The first time I saw the original I was at a drive-in and it was too dark to tell what the heck was going on, so I went back for a second viewing and loved it. I know the plot is loose, I know the characters sometimes shallow, and I know that the whole concept is silly... but you know what? I ate it up.After seeing the sequel I was surprised by how my expectations were greatly surpassed... It had the same energy, pizazz, and attraction as the original, only with way more blood, gore, and sex... and let's face it, I don't go to these kind of movies to be enlightened. If I want enlightenment I'll stay home and watch "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring." If you liked the first one, and you weren't sure exactly why, and everyone you know talked smack, then this movie is perfect for you. The plot is loose, the characters are shallow, and the whole concept is silly... but it kicks butt and takes names.I left the theater feeling like I should've when I left the Matrix:Reloaded, no offense of course, but there's just something about cool looking monsters that chew each other up for mostly incoherent reasons... This one is definitely going in my collection.Plus it's Kate Beckinsale in tight leather for two hours... who the heck is complaining and where are their expectations at?!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so happy that there is finally a sequel out there that is just as good if not better than the original. The movie had all the elements; drama, special effects,a love story and great action. I think what made the sequel so great was the fact that the movie took off right where the first one ended. Unlike some other movies that leave months or years of a gap unexplained, Underworld: Evolution showed what happened right after the big battle between the lycans and vampires where Selene ended up killing Viktor. Plus, Kate Beckensale and Scott Speedman had chemistry together. The love scene (we all know there's a love scene) was so hot! Kudos to Len Wiseman who directed both films. He really did an awesome job with the plot and special effects. In my eyes, it is possibly the best vampire story ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale was awesome in the movie. Micheal was definitely up to the task as the new hybrid of Lycan-Vampire. I was impress as to how they displayed his adaption to his new life. This is a movie that all horror flick-addicts should see. I hope that there will be a follow up to this movie. Maybe Seline and Micheal have a baby and they will follow how the two races co-exists or continue to kill each other just because of the years of hate between the two species. Seline, with her new powers, maybe Len will work on how she is transformed by her new powers. She is now the new force and power in the Vampire ranks. There is much that could be done it this realm of the movie. Micheal is still learning his new powers. There is so much that can be done in this area too. I really did like the falling back to give the audience a view of how they were when it all began. This had everything that one would want see to enjoy a excellent vampire movie. Kate Beckinsale has proved her ability to carry a movie by herself. She is the new action female and I hope to see her in many more movies. She has an allure that draws in the audience. It does not hurt that she is a very beautiful woman...ouch...that was my wife hitting me. I recommend this movie to all adults that enjoy action and vampire movies.-- Dexter F. Stowers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great for me. However, if you are planning to watch this movie, take a few things into account. If you liked the first one, then go for it. However, there's nudity (Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman have a love scene) and more gore than the first one. However, both main characters are more developed and act better. Even the smaller characters are better in this one. There is a bigger variety of weapons in this one, including Uzis, grenades, and throwing stars that explode on impact. UV ammo is still used, even though there is no use for the silver nitrate ammo. Almost everyone dies in this one, so don't get too attached to any one character. This one is more action packed, but still has a great storyline, like the first one, and still manages to stump the audience. It makes you think about the plot after you leave the theater, but you'll figure it out. However, if you still manage to be stumped, you should purchase Greg Cox's novelization; it's a great read!Kate and Scott acting have improved. In one scene, Kate almost made me cry. Now, I'm not an emotional person, so her acting must have been pretty powerful for that reaction.Len's directing has gotten better. The film still has that bluish tint, but has a more light feel to it. All the rain in the first one has been replaced with snow (it was filmed in Vancouver), and the CGI and wire work as well as the creature designs have improved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I liked the first Underworld film when it came out, I've grown to really love it in the intervening time, having watched it at least half a dozen times on DVD. The style, the action, the look of the film, the way-out action and the characters have all grown on me, and I've become a staunch fan of the movie in the two years or so since it came out.I knew a sequel was in the works, but I was leery, because Underworld seems like such a one-shot proposition; how could you combine all the right elements again, when it was such a tricky balance in the first place, and you killed one of the best characters, Lucian (Michael Sheen)? Sure, it was possible, but I was afraid it was unlikely.Underworld: Evolution is not so much a sequel as the second half of the first story, which, while it left itself open to continuation, never felt unfinished. This film picks up almost the moment when the first one ends; Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run after killing elder vampire Viktor (Bill Nighy), and, as expected, they must do battle against the sole remaining vampire elder, Marcus (Tony Curran), who, like Michael, is a hybrid of the two species, werewolf and vampire.In all fairness the movie takes a stab at bringing you up to speed, summarizing quickly the first film and delivering a neat pre-credits sequence set in medieval times to give you the backstory on Marcus and his first-ever-werewolf brother William, but really, unless you are somewhat familiar with the first movie, you'll be a little lost. Underworld had a lot going on underneath its slick surface; this film has even more, and builds on many of the details in the first film. If you aren't up on the first movie, rent it or pull it off the shelf before you go see this one; it'll help.The real beauty of this film is that, as a sequel, it delivers more of the same hyper-kinetic action and immortal double-dealing while expanding and enriching the details of the first film. The flipside of that is that if you didn't like the first film all that much, you won't like this one, but if (like me), you did like it, then you'll love this one. Underworld:Evolution manages to fall in that rare category of sequels that can be described as "the same thing, only moreso." The movie shares the same strengths and weaknesses as its predecessor; the action is lightspeed and amped up, which some will love and some won't. Like the first one, there's a maze of a story behind all the shooting and sneaking around, and you have to pay attention to catch all the little plot twists. I was pleased that they took at least a few scenes to devote to character moments (Michael trying to eat normal food, refusing to believe he has become an immortal stands out) among all the action and plot.Beckinsale seems even more comfortable playing her bad-ass vampire, and she completely sells the action, much as she did in the first one. Speedman is better here, breathing life into Michael, assuring, especially early on, that his character doesn't get overlooked. And Derek Jacobi is very sharp as the father of all immortals, Alexander Corvinus. Tony Curran is suitably menacing as Marcus; he had to spend half the film in what must have been an extremely uncomfortable latex suit, which was work all by itself, but when freed of his latex confines, he's a far more convincing and dangerous villain than the first film's Kraven.Overall, as I've said, it all depends on whether you liked the first film or not. If Underworld was your cup of tea, then you will really enjoy this film; if it wasn't, then this movie won't convert you. Personally, I loved it, and can't wait until the DVD is released; to my mind it delivered everything a sequel should, and was suitably cool, stylish, and clever in its own right. Director Len Wiseman and company deliver the material with even more confidence this time, making this film every bit as enjoyable as the first one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about the plot of the original "Underworld" (vampires versus werewolves!), I automatically thought the hurdle was set far too high and far too stupid for anything worthwhile to be achieved. I was wrong. Not a single dumb catchphrase or other Hollywood cliché tainted the movie. It was a thought-out script, wonderful casting, mindblowing special effects (so good, in fact, they truly show how lame ILM and Imaginary Forces have become), and all around entertainment. I was and still am blown away. So, when I heard there was a sequel being made, I got all the usual doubts. Sufficit to say from my rating, I was slapped in the face again. Slapped in the face and then kissed real real deep, so deep my lips started bleeding, because they were being gnashed on by a once-again wonderful, cohesive, and relevant script, loads of new eye-candy, and new cast as good as their successors. If you aren't into vampires, or werewolves, or both combating each other, obviously this movie won't mean much to you. And obviously, you are totally lame, brah!! To the fans of the first, however, don't fear. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a hardcore fan of Underworld, Evolution was a bittersweet experience. As often happens in Hollywood, the action and blood and gore was seized upon at the expense of what made the first one so cool, which is action balanced with a very deep rich universe and story. Like the hybrid fighting Viktor, it was cool, but fell short. I felt like i was watching a rough draft of what could have been an extremely awesome sequel. Time was wasted by unnecessary flashbacks and expose which the audience would already known having seen the first one. The love story was better, but the romance was more believable seeing Selena's emotions at Michael dying and restoring at the end with the musical score. Like the matrix sequel the sex scene was unnecessary and wasted time. Further more, in order to carry audiences into a universe of this sort, good character development is needed. Perhaps it is because Kate Beckingsale is married to the director, but Selene seemed to be the only character that mattered. Michael is the hybrid, but is treated as simply a useful sidekick. Although he evolved in power, fighting skill, and monstrous look, he was still easily defeated by the bad guy. His subplot of coming to terms and food scene had no place in the overall arc. Alexander Corvinus is the father of immortality, but his character was not very explored, killed off too soon. I expected interaction between him and Michael, being of their relation. I also thought it a lost opportunity that Michael and Marku didn't talk, being related and both being hybrids. Instead it is Selene who fights Markus. Markus was a ferocious monster, but not evil enough that i could see him killing his own father. William was the best werewolf i have ever seen in a movie, and the idea of a plague of dead people coming back to life like undead werewolf zombies was so fascinating, but once again their screen time and development was not as much as the movie could have allowed. In summary, Wiseman and his fellows didn't learn from the mistakes the first one. Not only was the sequel not as good as it could have been, it was weaker than i expected. As a hardcore fan, i am worried about Wiseman's statement that a third one will depend on fan reaction. I can only hope that fans are more forgiving, and that Wiseman and company will mature by the time a third one is made, if a third one is made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These sorts of things have to get quite a few steps right to succeed. First is to find a lode of notions that are stylish (so you can actually show them) and that drive the identity of a counterculture (so you have an audience base).Then you have to create a cosmology, a system of forces and laws, then groups representing and manipulated by them. Again, you need both the core notions and the means to communicate them.The first movie had these overlain on our own reality. Beings that live amongst us as humans have double identities as one or the other warring factions. This was a powerful notion, allowing for transmutations and symbol-laden clothing. I thought the movie very well put together up until this point, but failing dramatically in the actual visuals. The visual imagination of the thing was simply juvenile and the charisma of the heroine limited to the glisten of thighs. Now they decided to forgo the overlap of beasts and humans, and just depict the war between the two factions. Humans ? real, ordinary ones ? appear only in the slightest of contexts, though there is a lot of talk about keeping things hidden from them. The action is all between warring individuals. The twists in the story are several. They all have to do with family dysfunction, so clearly the writers understood their target audience.I could have gotten into this. I like style, and excess when it is cinematically centered. Yup, I'll sit through and enjoy anything that has visual oomph. That's why I actually enjoyed the similarly position "Lord of the Rings" stuff. But this isn't cinematic. Not even a little.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only watch this movie if you REALLY loved the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had a unique experience: I enjoyed a movie even though I knew that it was awful.If you want an impressive, well-thought-out, surprising vampire/werewolf movie, then go rent the first Underworld. If and only if it completely steals your brain should you watch this movie.I liked the first movie so much and felt so involved with its world and characters that I was able to sit down in the theater, enjoy the good moments and coast through the rest of it, which was mostly incoherent babble.Writing: Underworld: Evolution is missing most of the strengths that made its predecessor so believable: The dialogue was poorly written, poorly timed and repetitive, as if they thought their viewers had the combined IQ of a moldy kumquat and needed to be reminded of what had happened a few minutes earlier.Story: There was a similar effect with plot points: In the first movie, no one bothered to reiterate information that the audience already knew, even if some of the characters present didn't. The first movie gave the viewers four steps and allowed them to figure out the fifth themselves. Not so with Underworld: Evolution.Tone: Gone is the straight-faced, humorless elegance that made the clichés of the first film workable. Also, certain moments that seem to have been meant to be meaningful just didn't make it. Supernatural indigestion, for example, doesn't need dramatic background music.Characters: Although the protagonists on the screen were still very much Selene and Michael, the new characters were not developed well. Marcus's and Corvinus's motives were understandable on only the most superficial level. I missed the tortured, hypocritical Viktor who was just kind enough to care about.Pacing: What disappointed me most, I think, was that there were moments of attempted drama with no buildup. This movie could have been much cooler than it is.Continutity: There were a few major errors. I kept waiting for Marcus or Michael to remember Lucian's enzyme and either apply it to the problem with William or explain why it wouldn't work. Casual paint on a stone wall doesn't last for eight hundred years.Lycans: (sigh!) For all that they need a cooler name... Sure, we see plenty of werewolves in the fight scenes, but I miss the brutish complexity of lycan _characters._Effects: The special effects are mostly of the same relatively high quality as those of the first film. I'm mostly complaining about what they did to Michael's face in his hybrid form. He is not fun to look at any more. Come on, Mr. Wiseman! The guys all get to see the lovely Ms. Beckinsale in a tight costume. First you don't bring back Wentworth Miller's character, and now you make Michael ugly. Give us ladies back our eye candy!Blood: I don't mean the fight scenes. This is a vampire movie; there is going to be some use of blood as a metaphor for intimacy. There not much bloodletting in Underworld, but that only made what little there was more resonant and moving. Here, someone gets slurped every fifteen minutes, but surely it just not given enough time and emotional energy. (Yes, I'm saying that the first movie SUCKED LESS! Let's all get that out of our systems.)Bright spots: The interaction between Selene and Michael was pretty good, mostly because their characters were already established. In the first movie, Michael is pretty much an object, just reacting to what happens around him and it was nice to see him take a more active role. Also, the fight and chase scenes were pretty strong, if not always well-paced.The biggest plus here is that this movie was bad in a way that isn't going to take away from my enjoyment of the original when I watch it again ...which I will. A lot.Like I said, I enjoyed this movie, but I can't really recommend it to someone who's not already invested in the story. I have to warn you, it takes a lot to turn me off to something once I've decided that it's worth my time. Just to give you a hint, I didn't stop watching "The X-Files" until season eight. That's right! A whole year of, "What happened to our male lead?" before I gave up! Use that as your guideline. As for me, I'll cross my fingers and hope that they get their act back together for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die hard, let me say it again DIE HARD ! Vampire movie fan. Do I care that Len (Wiseman) has not given me a whole bible as to why these monsters are here and what their grand design is? NO! I don't even know why we humans are on this planet so what do I care about a sci-fi movie meant to entertain! Selene is my kick ass heroine of the millennium (my 5 year old daughters too!) The story picks up right after the fight with Viktor and I thought that was great! It is as dark and gritty as the original (uh hello, lil boy from Brazil, vamp movies are supposed to be dark!). The action scenes were great, unlike the nerdy dweebs who sit in theaters and analyze every digital frame of a movie, I pay my money and sit back to enjoy the imagination of my fellow vampire loving man. Kate and Scott did not have enough sappy scenes in my opinion but what was offered will hold me until Len grants me my wish of a 3rd installment. Lighten up people, the story is good and fun and fast, just like I love em! And I saw it twice and both times the audience in the theater with me (predominantly male) let out hoots and hollers at the finale! We all loved it and if you loved part 1 then it will most definitely not be a waste of money, but for you skeptics that are also cheap there is always the matinée. Que vivan los Vampiros and Lycans!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the movie tonight... and honestly, everything made 150% sense to me. If things didn't make sense to you, see it (and the first perhaps) again... all the facts are there and both were incredibly well written.I missed Underworld in the theatres the first time. A lot of people did. It seemed to slip under the radar and when I rented it simply out of interest, I was floored at how rich the movie was in characters, plot, and a wide array of other great cinematic characteristics. They played so many parts of the movie out in such great taste, that when Underworld: Evolution hit the news, I was a little surprised. Not in a bad way; I mean they did leave a lot of open-ended things for a sequel, but the movie itself was pretty complete on it's own.The opening scene of U:E just left me in awe. Hollywood does a lot of things wrong when it's creating sequels and one of the biggies is REcasting characters. Seeing the ORIGINAL cast members play the roles in U:E was perfect. And the writers for Underworld in general, I must say, are pretty brazen and brave for killing off people who you probably EXPECT to carry on in the sequel. Craven's near-immediate death in the beginning leaves you in shock - which is great. But even more immediate was their entrance into the chamber which PERFECTLY gave you the sense that U:E picks up, to the minute, where Underworld left off - I loved it! In comparison to other movies of it's genre - Underworld plays more like a book or a full-fledge story where the HISTORY, and the overall STORY, take precedence over the characters. Take the Blade movies for instance - they're based off of a comic book. They completely revolve around Blade. Underworld however is based on a war... a war that's lasted for such a long time that they can go ANYWHERE with the story. And if written as well as U:E, a third might be a success as well.The entire 'amulet' following in the first movie - until U:E I thought, like most people I'm sure, that it was just something sentimental and not a huge detail... but important enough to stick in my head. Then to find out it's just a speck in a much bigger story? That was excellent.Overall I think U:E was incredible. I'm always wary of sequels, and to convince myself to fork over the insane amount of cash theatres want these days, I really need to want to see the movie. I'm glad I re-watched Underworld last night and U:E tonight - the timing was perfect.The only two drawbacks, which weren't even really bad at all, that I felt in the movie were: The 'sex' scene - I'm sure many people wanted such a scene, but a many times, without good direction it's just a tawdry waste *cough* Matrix *cough* But they did such a tasteful job of it, it wasn't really bad at all. The other was the end... death by a helicopter blade? So overdone, lol! Selene's close call was great, but the blades should've died down on their own before the scene's climax - I really felt that would've been a good twist.Now with the buzz of a third... prequel or sequel, I'm a little worried. Hollywood is going nuts on this "Trilogy" kick and some things may be best left in pairs... but they're in the business to make money, right? A prequel would be interesting, and a sequel (I think) would be difficult... maybe a baby? How does it age? New leaders? There have to be more elders, right? Alexander stayed under the radar for that long... Who knows!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME!!!! So good I watched it twice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to go see the movie at 5pm today, first showing in my town. I was so blown away by it that I paid to see it again, at the second showing. I can tell you this....I will be seeing it again next week, as I still have the free movie ticket from best buy to use. I'm definitely going to do my part to get the box office take big enough for a third Underworld movie.This movie was great both as a sequel or stand alone. With the flashes of the first movie, even someone new to the Underworld would know what is going on. The flick was action packed, with great effects and fighting. You could also really feel the love and chemistry between Selene and Michael this time around, which was great for me as a woman. The only thing that took a little getting use to was some of the camera work; if anyone has seen the movie 28 Days, you'll know what I mean. Evolution uses some of the same kind of camera work that was used in 28 Days.At the second showing I went to there were many "yeah"s shouted by the audience when Marcus and William got what was coming to them, and the crowd clapped for the movie when it ended. There were also "oohs" and "oh!"s during the more bloody times, and people upset when Michael was "killed"; many of the viewers really seemed to get into it. I heard many comments from other viewers that it was a "great" movie as they were leaving.I must admit that when Michael was "killed" I was quite upset with Len Wiseman, but of course, to my delight I got what I wanted, which was Selene and Michael together. I loved the ending, it sets it up perfectly for a sequel, ah yes....Underworld 3!! :-) As much as I would enjoy seeing the Blood Enemy novel brought to the big screen, I'm much more interested in seeing Selene and Michael's story movie forward, rather than back (as long as Len doesn't do away with either of them. ;-)If you liked the first Underworld, I don't think there is any chance for disappointment with this movie; go out and see Evolution as soon, and as often, as possible!Hey!!! Now I can read the Evoultion novel, can't wait! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but novelization is much better!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife &amp; I just saw the movie today (Jan. 20, 2006) at 12:30pm.She thought it was too bloody, but liked the main characters enough to enjoy the film.After reading the novelization by Greg Cox, I thought this movie would be far better than the first one... But I was wrong!! (It's only just as good...which should be fine, right?) The book is awesome!! Mr. Cox tells a really great story that didn't show up in the final cut of the film.I know it's hard to show what people are thinking in a film, but I wish that director Len Wiseman had given us much more character development. There is so much that's in the book that didn't make it onto the screen. For example: We never find out in the film where the Cleaners came from or just how truly loyal they are to Lorenz Macaro (Alexander Corvinus). In the movie they are just soldiers on a ship that obey Macaro's orders to clean up the messes that Lycans &amp; Vampires make. In the book you find out a lot more about them and hope that some of them actually make it through the whole film, just like Selene &amp; Michael do. (At least I did!! ^_^) I really do hope that there will be an "Unrated Extended Cut" to Underworld: Evolution when it comes out on DVD, like there was for the first film. To me it seams like there needs to be at least 30 more minutes edited back in... I just hope Mr. Wiseman filmed the whole script so he can do just that.Before seeing the movie (or maybe just after), you might want to read the novelization so that things in the film will make more sense to you.</fullReview>

Without your hard-work, we in the real world would have absolutely no reason to dream anymore. On a side note, Markus, wow. I did not expect such a development.

		<fullReview>With Underworld being a first of its kind, action packed joy ride, Underworld:Evolution does not disappoint for being the sequel to the 100 million dollar + box office hit adventure the first one gave us.I would say that the first edition is more darker than the sequel only because that it answers many questions that the first put in our minds.Evolution in my opinion is much better than the first edition, only because the battle scenes are excellent and all questions are answered.I also agree its great the CG was less as the first one was. Make-up as well is phenomenal making the Lycans looks better than ever with markus and all other creatures was grade A.I will just leave it at this, Anyone who thought the first one had potential or enjoyed, Underworld: Evolution will blow your mind with jaw-dropping action scenes, great character development, plot, and answers to your questions the first one left with us! Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, and take pleasure in watching a sequel thats dressed to impress!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, here's the thing.This film seemed to be based on the fact that Kat Beckinsale is very pretty in leather.That's it. I can see no other reason for this film to exist.I liked the first film, I did. You could just sit back, turn your brain off, and watch the very shiny Ms. Beckinsale shoot werewolves in tight leather, supported by a thin - but not bad - Werewolves vs. Vampires plot.This film, however, has nothing like a plot. Well, not that I can remember. I think my brain went to sleep during the final "battle", due to the fact that there wasn't anything previously had failed to grab my attention. Even a Kate Bekinsale sex scene, which should be a no brainer to work (pretty lady + nudity), just seemed out of place, and just an excuse for the director to say "Look at my wife! Isn't she hot! I bet you wish you were me!".The best parts of this film were the parts that had characters like Lucian and Kraven, as they reminded me just how much better the first film was.</fullReview>

The details of the plot have fitted in quite well with the loose ends left untied at the end, and many of the costumes and digital scenes have gotten an awesome upgrade from the last movie (admit it, the werewolves were just a little too fake.)Fascinatingly (is that even a word?) enough, just about every moment was just as exciting as the trailer portrayed---they didn't let you down on that end. If you are a fan, be prepared for a third movie because it is as heavily hinted at as it was in the first, and left me screaming all the way out of the theater, having people stare and wondering what I was on.

		<shortDescription>THE BEST FILM EVER MADE... cept not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attention: If you are a fan of the film Underworld, chances are you will enjoy the not-so-originally titled sequel Underworld: Evolution (film-making 101: if you want a trendy title, add "evolution" or "resurrection" at the end.) However, for those who were less than impressed with the barely mediocre original, such as that Dan Russell guy, it is a pleasant surprise that this sequel exceeds its predecessor in both vision and quality.Directed and conceived by Len Wiseman, the husband of lead star Kate Beckinsale, the atmosphere here is dripping with style, as there is a rustic, cold feel to every image that works spectacularly.The action scenes, an undeniably major draw for a genre film like this, are well-done as well. They are spaced appropriately throughout the film, thus helping the script avoid bunching all the expository scenes into a lump, leaving an uneven mix of pure narrative and pure eye candy.Still, at times the camera work falls into the trap of overusing extreme close-ups. Sure, to a point this technique can help enhance the feeling that we are "there," but it quickly becomes annoying and it pretty much hides the specifics of the action.With this said, Underworld: Evolution is only a moderate offender of the "shakey cam," and the reasonable mix of computer generated special effects and practical effects such as complex make-up and animatronics is a breath of fresh air.Of course there is little surprise that the plot has nothing special to offer. There is something about a waging war between vampires and werewolves (excuse me, Lycans), where a new breed will rise and then blah, blah, blah.True, amidst a convoluted mess of two dimensional characters and clichés lies the essence of an interesting story, but too often is any real narrative interest attained. Few characters leave any lasting impression, and as names and events are brought into focus the universe of Underworld: Evolution becomes a jumble with little consistency.The first film is nicely summarized, at least, so this sequel offers something for both fans and new audience members alike.Also, true boredom is never reached thanks to some sharp pacing. All too often do films with terrible plots linger on their weakest aspects, yet here the moments that don't work in this episodic script are quickly passed by in favor of something more interesting.The acting is much like the plot in that it is never truly terrible, nor is it ever inspiring. Kate Beckinsale certainly passes her job as "sexy but tough female hero" with flying colors, though that is not exactly an original performance to pull off.The other lead, Scott Speedman, could have given his performance in a coma, and the rest of the cast never stands out in any way.The drab acting is likely a conscious choice rather than a result of lazy film-making, but that doesn't change the fact that it really hurts many of the subtler moments. Especially noticeable is a complete lack of chemistry between our two main heroes.At least there isn't a lot of hammy over-acting.Overall, for a sequel to a modest hit Underworld: Evolution is a success. It isn't a revolutionary film, nor does it stray much from the roots of its influences (i.e. the Blade and Matrix trilogies.) However, it is an enjoyable if forgettable experience that offers exactly what it promises without ever becoming too preachy or pretentious.Critic's Conclusion: Ultimately an uneven cinematic experience, Underworld: Evolution is neither a masterpiece nor a failure. This is a solid case of "what you see is what you get," and what the film lacks in twists and originality it makes up for with a competent understanding of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very British Production with American Director &amp; Screenwriter!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching Underworld a few years ago at the cinema. I for one really liked it. Most of my friends had mixed reviews of the film. Some critics said that it was a ROMEO AND JULIET story amongst VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES... but that was hardly the case. The story was very, very original... unlike what Hollywood does... recycling the same stinking storyline over and over again.Also... unlike Hollywood action/sci-fi/horror/fantasy whatever films... it's not MTV-Orientated, it doesn't try to throw in some funny jokes which just aren't funny at all, it's not cheesy, there are no cheesy cameos and no over-emphasis on being way too commercial.The film is a very British Production with mainly British Actors... despite the writing and directing credits going to 2 Americans... one being Kate Beckinsale's husband.So I liked the first movie... but I felt as thought it could've been better. A bit more plot, a bit more depth and a bit more action.This one worked better than anybody else expected. I read in the Herald Sun that this movie only got One Star... and the jerks from Rolling Stone gave the original Underworld One Star as well.This is a truly lavish production. Although very dark, it's very beautiful. The action scenes are very well done and not too over the top... unlike that of the worst movie in which I have ever seen ever (Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle) because in that movie the characters were supposed to be real human beings and they were doing things that were 10-Time More Over The Top than anything and everything that these super vampires and werewolves/hybrids were doing.Being say that some of the acting is a bit out of it in this movie and pointed the finger at the small role played by Bill Nighy. I reckon that's wrong. I thought Bill Nighy was playing the character of Viktor. He was very disturbing, and his speech sounded like that of a vicious creature which I believed worked really well.You've also got Sir Derek Jacobi... a finely trained Shakespeare actor from way back adding to the mix. Scott Speedman really did improve in this movie and the performance of Tony Curran sent a real chill down my spine. Terrifying and truly riveting stuff from the awesome Scotsman.But the major award goes out to Kate Beckinsale. Although she wonders around in that hot and sexy tight leather outfit of hers... she is a strong heroine. Not one to be seduced by some hunky guy that comes her way and not as annoying as Angelina Jolie's interpretation of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raiders movies... and not ditsy like those chicks from Charlie's Angels... she is my number one heroine in all movie history.I love this movie. Great acting. Great plot. Great action. Stunning visualization and everything just worked so well for me. I saw it twice in one day... I simply couldn't get enough of it. Hopefully both movies will be repackaged in a Special Edition 2-DVD Set... and if there is a third one... I hope like hell that it doesn't suck or else that'll ruin everything. If there is a God... may the third one not suck... PLEASE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save yourself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the worst movie I have ever seen, barely beating out My Best Friend's Wedding. It was dry, dull, pointless, it made little sense... Save yourself and your wallet, do not go to this movie. If you do you'll kick yourself for days. Where I work at we once ran into a pile of doo-doo in the men's bathroom that overflowed onto the seat and we had to clean it up. Having seen this movie I realize the toilet monster wasn't that bad. The first half hour or so is the worst of it. There is no practical story line and then when you attempt to understand what's happening you realize the movie is almost over and Derrick Jackobi shows up outta nowhere and then there's werewolves and vampires and guns. Not even Kate Beckinsdale's good looks could save this utter pile of turkey (turkey is a dry meat... dry movie... get it?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compared to Underworld 1 and both Blade movies, this sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wasn't this movie supposed to be aimed at people like me. I'm male, love stupid horror vampire werewolf type films, but this sucked. the first Underworld was fun, the second is stupid. why, well the first had a much better story, one that you could follow. this ran like a 1.5 hour intro for a video game. the effects are nothing to write home about, except perhaps the gloriously craptacular opening scene, which was so jerky and schizophrenic that it often looked like claymation. I don't know who they think there target demographic is. I thought it was me, I'm a 20 something male who likes a good werewolf vampire flick, I can suspend my disbelief, thats why i coughed up 8 bucks. But i don't want some dudes butt in the love scene, and absolutely no nipple from the girl. I can believe a vampire is strong enough to pull a helicopter out of the sky, but at least have him hold on to something to brace himself, for crying out loud. and the plot, way to much for a movie like this. sure the girl in the suit is hot, but not 8 dollars hot, considering the other options. frankly this movie would play better as a video game. save yourself the dough, buy a used copy of underworld 1 or blade, and google the chick to get your latex suit fix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping that this film would have more of the cool back story and history in the forefront. I expect sequels to be bigger and better. More vampires, more werewolves. More cool characters. Unfortunately, this movie is more like watching people play a video game where monsters fight each other. No tension. Nothing interesting. Beckensale is super hot, but I'd rather spend the money on a Maxim magazine with her in it. Plus, why doesn't anybody shoot action like Spielberg used to? Cool dolly shots. Lots of wide shots to see what's going on? This film like Batman Begins has action sequences that are almost impossible to follow because they are cut so fast with so many long lens shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than-anticipated sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION (2006) **1/2 Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Tony Curran, Derek Jacobi, Bill Nighy, Steven Mackintosh, Shane Brolly, Brian Steele. Better than-anticipated sequel to the 2004 "Underworld" with vampires Beckinsale in league with 'hybrid' werewolf Speedman out to stop the nefarious 'hybrid' vampire Curran from his plan to dominate the subspecies with no mercy to those who get in his way. Over-the-top and borderline campy with its graphic novel appeal and unapologetic gore galore the film runs on full gusto from beginning to end with some inventive action sequences and not-too-shabby visual f/x (I'm more of the old-school practical horror make-up but the beasties here look better than its predecessor) make up for the loosely structured plotting provided by filmmaker Len Wiseman (who collaborated on the script with Danny McBride). The kick ass last act is worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for the rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale does her best, but she cannot save this confused, sloppy movie - between the poorly choreographed fight scenes (the original Underworld shines by comparison) and the very large huh? factor in the storyline (if one charitably calls it that), I was disappointed in this effort. But the doom of most sequels is that there is no real effort to develop the story or any new ideas; just an attempt to milk any favorable buzz from the original for the maximum dollar return. Don't waste your dollars, wait for a friend to rent it and go over and visit them to watch it, but only if you like Kate...Even Bill Nighy is cardboard and phoning it in...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever, I cannot believe I went to see this junk!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Original Underworld which was great movie only to be ruined by this piece of junk. Please tell me people, who was the leader of the werewolves in this new movie? I have put several posts before about this topic, and no one listen until now. When they killed Lucian and Raze off they ruined the whole sequel. Now can you really tell me this junk was worth it, you little vampires wanna bees? I cannot believe how awful this was. It seemed like it was vampires vs other vampires vs other vampires. THis movie was suppose to be vampires and werewolves, dummies. Only wolves action was at the beginning, Tanis place and toward the end, only a few seconds worth. Nothing but a absolute mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie surpasses the first! BIG TIME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to "UNDERWORLD" is totally outstanding. The special effects, the graphics, and the action was indeed top notch. Selene(Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman) were indeed a very top notch team against the world of vampires and lycans. I enjoyed every minute of it. Selene has never lost her edge in fighting, and Corvin did himself well against the lycans as well. For Corvin being a half-breed, makes the other monsters second best, and Selene gave him some encouragement about his condition. Although Corvin had to learn the hard way about being a half-breed. Especially, when he tries to eat regular food which doesn't responds to his system well. For the others in the first movie, Kraven(Shane Brolly) met his end against Marcus(Tony Curran), he makes Viktor(Bill Nighy) a very distrustful leader of the vampires. Knowing the secrets of one another got the two fighters closer to the truth, and the father Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi) was a victim of his own pride. Knowing he could no longer trust his sons, he only puts his trust Selene. Talk about the ultimate sacrifice. I thought only a slit on the wrist would do him in. Nope! He must be stronger than I thought. This movie is so action packed, I could see this movie again and again. I couldn't get enough of Beckinsale. Her body is so hot, after her daughter, she still can flaunt it well! I didn't see not one sweat droplet. And the women will love Speedman as well. I enjoyed most was the truck scene. Making the driver leave was funny, and Selene can handle that Ford truck well, even if the side of it ate the face of the mountain, and Marcus. No wonder Ford said, "BUILT FORD TOUGH!" They weren't kidding! Full of action, full of the fun, "Underworld: Evolution" is the top of its game! It's worth the watch! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More action, More blood, More flesh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I've seen much debate about wanting to delve further into the pre-history behind the characters in this movie series. Now, you do get a fair share in some excellent flashbacks that open the film -- so don't show up late! Beyond that, you have to keep in mind that the political aura surrounding the film borrowed liberally from White Wolf books, and games such as Vampire The Masquerade. This was done to raise the content above "camp" - and treat the subject matter more seriously and appeal to not only the Goth crowd, but the Action crowd as well. And it worked! If you were a fan of the first Underworld movie, go see this one. But be warned, keep the little kids at home. There is more intense action, LOTS more blood and gore, and a lengthy love scene (which features no *explicit* nudity, but is still a treat for fans of the beautiful Beckinsale). The CGI is far superior to the original movie, the European feel of the film actually seemed more pronounced to me, and the fully transformed Marcus is an amazing sight to behold -- and there's plenty of him! All in all, I give it an 8 out of ten. Not the greatest film ever made, but an excellent horror/action movie that takes itself seriously -- but not *too* seriously;) -Jeff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the $100 million worldwide hit, "Underworld: Evolution" continues the saga of war between the aristocratic Death Dealers and the barbaric werewolves.The film traces the beginnings of the ancient feud between the two tribes as Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire heroine, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the vampire-werewolf hybrid, try to unlock the secrets of their bloodlines. The fast-paced, modern-day tale of deadly action, ruthless intrigue and forbidden love takes them into the battle to end all wars as the immortals must finally face their retribution.Underworld is set to become a trilogy. Screen Gems has made a deal for Danny McBride and Len Wiseman to write a sequel to the femme-centric werewolf thriller, which Wiseman has said he would again direct. A third film, a prequel, could follow. No deal is in place for star Kate Beckinsale, though she has expressed interest in reprising her part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Face Rocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I don't know if I've seen a sequel this good before. Bring some glue for your face, cause its sure to get rocked off. The only bad part about seeing this movie is trying to find your face afterward. I must have picked up rocked-off faces from 12 other people before I found my own. The story line is continued nicely, and the characters play their roles as well as they did in the first movie. The movie keeps the viewer's attention to the very end and leaves the viewer's wanting more. If you liked the first movie at all then you will not be disappointed when seeing this film. Effects were good in this film and the storyline is so entertaining that, in several scenes, you will not want to blink. If your friend's say that they did not like this movie then they are liars and bad influences. I give Underworld Evolution a 10 out of 10 due to its righteousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to take a sneak peak at this movie because my friend owns a theater, and I loved this movie. I think this was just as good if not better than the first. She is awesome in the movie and I am going to watch it again this weekend. This is a must see movie. I thought that the acting was great, and the plot was excellent. This I could say is the best movie of the year so far. This movie is going to keep your attention for the whole movie, and want to make you watch it again and again. I did not know what to expect when I went to see it, but of coarse with Kate B. you can not go wrong, because she is such a presence in this movie. I hope that they make a third movie because if it is any thing like the second movie there will be know stopping me from going to see it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I used to love that kind of hard-core fantasy sci-fi action flicks but I guess I can't follow anymore. I don't even know why this sequel has even been made because I don't remember the first one being such a hit. Except for Kate Beckinsale, the entire cast is flat and uninteresting. The movie is not even fun, just unimaginative, brainless and boring. There is no script. The action is not even choreographed or shot well. I've been seeing violent films since my youngest age, but this is violent in the most disgusting and useless way. What's the point? Where's the excitement? Just imagine if this was directed by the likes of James Cameron, Paul Verhoeven or John McTiernan. How come we don't see anymore Terminators, Aliens, Robocops, Total Recalls or Predators?</fullReview>
