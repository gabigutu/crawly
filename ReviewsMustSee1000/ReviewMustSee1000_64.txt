		<shortDescription>Actually it's pretty GOOD history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for "American Stereotypes"... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian. My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's "Juden!" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the greatest movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them. It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest War Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell, and "Saving Private Ryan" peeks into the gates of Hades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What "Saving Private Ryan" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me. That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain. Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else. Simply amazing. An all time great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in "Saving Private Ryan" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article "Best War Movie Ever Made"" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As "entertaining" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the "lulls," is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is "memorable," just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent despite some Spielberg slips into sentiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed. In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say ? it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws. The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war. This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes. The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done ? it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown. I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story. Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often. For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America. Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well ? although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits. Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film ? so of course they will focus on the American experience. However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies. I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful. There's nothing wrong with focus ? but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem. It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie ? when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film ? why be surprised when it's focus is Americans! Of the cast Hanks is good ? he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd. He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc. Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors. Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up ? although Damon has one of the simplest characters. They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw ? just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality. Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail? For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach? No one was prepared for how horrific it really was? No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosions?You really got a sense of what these guys had to go through? Within that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines? For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it done?Throughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing? For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer? It's one of the most intimate? It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatly?Toward the middle, a German soldier called "Steamboat Willie" is introduced? By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German? Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight? He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier? The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms? Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character? They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is "Saving Private Ryan". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy ("Paths of Glory") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war ("The Enemy Below"). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them ("The Longest Day"). This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Among the most obvious:A sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns, which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry, driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of anti-tank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older second-tier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.So just what is "Saving Private Ryan"? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the "Longest Day" whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistake-ridden, choppy, and contrived remake of "The Big Red One". Ultimately, this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than "Kelly's Heroes"- a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. Then there is the finale, a total rip-off of Arthur Pohl's "The Bridge" (1949), which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan, most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost (that is not particularly unusual), but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting post-war portrayals (such as "Das Boot" and "Cross of Iron") of the German soldier as something more than the sub- human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own "Raiders of the Lost Ark" series. The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim, this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized (and unexamined) by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema, where McCarthy-paralyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements, away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releaseAlthough "Saving Private Ryan was popular, remember that the "Rat Patrol" ran for 58 episodes, watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear."Saving Private Ryan" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile "characters" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD. The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List). The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF pussy - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change (take a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example). What Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonderwhich Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who know little about the battle (that's almost everyone who's in the theater) probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.Believe me, the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if itwere as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon, which they did. I wonder, for example, how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film it looks about a couple hundred yards. It was, in actuality, almost ten miles wide. The timing was also inaccurate - Hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM. Another historical error is the implication that the events at Omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches (Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah). That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach, for example, the other US assault beach, took about a dozen casualties - many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action. But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script. Here we have the US Army sending a squad(a squad!!!) to march straight thru the entire German 7th Army (something two Divisions, with total air superiority couldn't do for weeks), waltz around an area of 300 square miles, and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this nonsense, the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning. "Gliders, what gliders"? said Spielberg. That's what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't know very much about his subject. A stupid, stupid film. What a waste of $100M or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughable pro-war propaganda movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course the first combat sequence was great, but unfortunately I was considered a sociopath for snickering at a man wandering around to pick up his dismembered arm while the camera is still shaking on the ground -- it becomes obvious Spielberg tries too hard to elicit the emotions from a cynical person like me. I eventually become sick and nauseated at having been forced to watch the ultimately annoying and repetitive guerilla cinematography while the violence and mayhem prevails. Is it supposed to depict the reality of war? Maybe yes, but all it does is always impact, impact, impact and I felt little or no emotion. After the first sequence, SPR stooped for the lowest level -- and I tried to keep awake during some tedious parts, but I ended up snickering and laughing at a few utterly lame and manipulative scenes (Remember Edward Burns' arrogantly stoic character and Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller's speech?). One of the biggest problems with the film is the audience at first showed distain for the translator because he's a "coward" (why the critics say this in their reviews is beyond me) and then cheered when he shot one of the German soldiers to death just to show his courage -- I found this disturbing. After the final battle, the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax I've ever seen -- from the slowly progressing (and clichéd) morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the U.S. flag waving for another 25 seconds. After I left the theater quietly, I let out intense rib-aching laughter all the way driving home. This is what Mr. Goldman observes as "phony and manipulative, to serve our Country". I'm sorry if I sound crude, but I debunk SPR for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with Patch Adams, another worse movie that year.This is my honest opinion - to observe, dissect and criticize -- and I don't trust the critics anymore because they went overboard just for the realistic depictation of war violence, calling the movie "the greatest war movie ever made!" In truth, older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting (Path of Glory and The Longest Days) -- despite the fact they're tame for not being profane and gory. And most importantly, SPR shouldn't be shown in English classes in high schools just as another critically overrated The Clockwork Orange shouldn't. It only serves to desensitize the kids because of the "war is bad" propaganda coupled with the U.S.-saluting totalitarianism. The epitome of a double-wham hypocrisy just like the propagandizing Nazi films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Spielberg: All Frosting, No Cake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a historic and artistic context, here's a question that would bother Spielberg if he thought about it for a second: what if there was no such thing as special effects? If we take the special effects from his movies, would they still be great? What, you're waiting for an answer? Just like every Spielberg movie, we find Steve desperately clinging to special effects like a fish to water. Like Bush to oil. Like Uwe Boll to a video game-to-movie conversion (last one is not necessarily bad, by the way).Just like everybody else, I was amazed by the "realism" of the first 5 minutes. Once you get past the battle scenes, there's not much to work with. I'm glad people (as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here) are starting to realize this.Let's set aside the absurdity of the "plot" (I use 'plot' very loosely). That's just a vehicle; a pretext; an excuse to use special effects (Spielberg's one and only leverage). The main plot is that a mother lost a number of her sons, so the general (or whatever his rank was) thinks she shouldn't lose her last remaining son, Ryan. He reads a letter Abraham Lincoln sent to a mother who went through a similar experience during the civil war. Using musical cues and closeups, Spielberg is not trying to tell us how to feel; he's practically *begging* us to do so. After all, he knows better than anybody that people will - during the course of the movie - realize that the battle scenes aren't that numerous or long, so there better be some story to back the movie up.Since he knows that he's addressing a crowd that made movies like Armageddon and Independence Day box office hits, he (correctly) realized that the script needs to be comprised of one element only: text. So long as the script contained text, it was good enough. And he was right. With enough flash and special effects, he was able to appeal to the idiocy of the average American, a tactic mastered by Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay and their likes.Now, back to the 'plot': once you set it aside, you'll realize that this movie is trying to instill many ideas into the minds of the movie goers. When he shows German soldiers, he shows them from a distance, so by not giving them a face, a human side, he teaches us that it's totally OK to thrill at killing them. Bad German bad! After our heroes free a German, Spielberg makes is very clear that he came back later to kill Tom Hanks. Spielberg is saying: they should've killed him the first time. The only good German is a dead one, apparently. Astonishing dishonesty and malice on the part of Spielberg. Not a trick was a spared to demonize every single one of them.Unlike masters of movie making (a title Spielberg will never come close to) like Scorsese and Coppola, he desperately needs musical cues to tell when to feel sad, fearful, excited, etc. His approach to emotion is so utterly sappy, shallow and downright laughable that it's virtually impossible for him to let the scenes and the story speak for themselves. He must have very clear cues to give the viewers signals. The music is like a slap in the face. Spielberg manifests in moments like "tell me I lived a good life", grabs you by the throat and ORDERS you to shed a few tears. Insulting. Pathetic.The only good part in the movie is the whole scene of the mistaken identity, where they realize this whining little weakling crying his eyes out is not the Ryan they wanted. Other than that, and looking at the chutzpah of the musical cues, the absurdity of the plot, the dehumanization of the Germans and the hilarious warfare errors, the movie is only good for another laugh, albeit not one Spielberg was aiming for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg must really hate Germans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of the film is visually stunning and really hits you in the face. But when Tom Hanks and his buddies have made it through the first enemy line this film turns in to a Hollywood war movie in which good and bad are clearly divided between the Americans (according to Spielberg, there were only white American teenagers and Tom Hanks participating in D-Day) and the Germans. The way in which he portays the reallity of battle also is not very objective(as history should be portrayed) whenever an American soldier gets shot, the audience is manipulated in feeling his pain and when a German soldier gets shot the audience is made to feel the excitement of victory. We are also made to belief that the German soldiers really liked it there killing Americans, while on the other hand the Americans are righteous believers in God and really have a lot of problems when they have to kill some one. Well Spielberg marketed this all as an important history lesson he had to tell, well he really must hate Germans depicting them in a way as he does in Saving Private Ryan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally Weak Film Based on Flawed Sentimentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the "glorious, morally superior American armed forces", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all "good guys". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the "communist threat" and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the "Red Hunt", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.It is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the "best wars film ever" as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen. Perhaps, instead of giving Spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre, they should go out and rent "Come and See" (Russian), The Burmese Harp (1967), Fires on the Plain (1959) or Paths of Glory (1957), truly far superior films to this Hollywood-bastardization and candy treatment of war. There is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at D-Day, according to Spielberg, was in some way just a side show to saving "Private Ryan". With such a simplistic statement, it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that 'action, action, action' is equated with 'greatness'. I only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth. While most viewers, who are safely tucked away in their houses, waving American flags and discharging a few tears, saying, "You German scum! You German scum!" can truly appreciate blood and guts as "cinema" then there is a market for it. After you get through the puerile premise, then you can sit back, have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most cliché-driven rubbish that has ever been produced. The scenes themselves are overdrawn, stolen from previous war films from the 1950's, namely the Longest Day (1962) which was a great film in itself. The beach landing is too long, and it shows only the Americans as "heroic" while the Germans are seen as "evil Hun scum". Tom Hanks, in his most idiotic and candid self, seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save Private Ryan and in one completely absurd scene, the remaining 15 Americans defeat a battle hardened, superiorly trained SS special unit group with just a few guns. Now, if you know anything about history, then you would know that the SS were not an "easy group" to defeat, they were some of the most fanatical and well-trained soldiers of the German Reich but since Spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots, he'll continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines. This is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else, I would suggest watching "Hell Is for Heroes" (1962) with Steve McQueen, because it is a lot better and we don't have to be forced to carry an American flag at the end.</fullReview>

A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -"Macgyver/Rambo scene"-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some upsetting battle sequences for a plain story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed. Instead, he wants to keep on fighting.Apart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses, "saving private Ryan" is a thrilling war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-medication, Mr. Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with "Schindler's List." That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of "Armageddon": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all. So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as "All quiet on the Western Front" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a "real" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an "Oscar" until "Schindler's List." That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch "All quiet on the Western Front" or "Das Boot."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America saves the world - again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The acting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film a bit for me.The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war ended.Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of the German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and for a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the Americans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representations.With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of the Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before America even entered the war!The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American POW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in 1998 (in England), it was a big disappointment for me in many ways. As not mentioned here for the first time, the first 20 min of the film are technically impressive. What follows then, is just stupid, one-sided and is - at least from the viewpoint of a German - invidious. I cannot understand that a man with over 50 years of life experience (Steven Spielberg) can make such a stupid film about second world war in 1998, or my explanation is that this man has no character. The second disappointment, perhaps the bigger one, were the reports that in the United States this movie was received with overwhelming applause and ecstatic feelings of patriotism. This is only a film, but it also tells you something about what people really think. Before that, I had thought the Americans were (at least since 50 years) our friends. After this film and especially the reception of the film by the broader audience in the USA (as I had read about it in newspapers and magazines), I thought: they may be our collaborators in many ways, but they are not our friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the single worst films I have ever seen. Spielberg was, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour. The first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it. I was in the theater and began to ask myself, "How could Ryan remember the D-Day invasion when in fact he was never there?"Now, honestly, how did Spielberg expect to get away with that one? It was never explained or followed up in any way. Secondly, how did he expect to get away with portraying the Germans as mindless, blood-thirsty grunts? "Well they were, weren't they?" says the blindly patriotic american. This aspect of the film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the brain-washed americans. Finally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line. This film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting it. The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence, which sadly enough drew many people to the film. Two thumbs down!</fullReview>

NEVER!Yet another great, expensive war film, where the Germans fight like Italians, TOTALLY arrogant to anyone else. I mean HONESTLY an American flag at the start and at the end. Showing the American and French flags. The ENGLISH and CANADIANS DID land on Normandy too. The only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about Monty.The Germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the Americans in France, but that doesn't matter because they were on the wicked side.This is the kind of film simply made to win another Oscar for Speilbergs already crowded shelf. Not a ground breacker, not a truthful film. NOT even historically correct!!1. Radar was a TOTAL secret. No American privates or captains would have ANY idea of what Radar was.2. Germans, especially those of the SS, would NEVER be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with Tanks first. It was common military knowledge for both sides.3. The P-51 D mustang, which blows up the Tiger Tanks on the bridge, were NEVER tank destroyers, they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion. The only Tank destroyers being employed at that time were BRITISH. NOT AMERICAN. So of course the Americans would take out this imperfect feature.Frankly, if you're American, you can go get your gun an' feel patriotic once again, as you have done with "The dirty Dozen" "Where Eagles Dare". If you're not American, avoid this, and stick to "The Boat" for your WWII viewing. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have some things to say here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like "proud to be an American" or "part of American History" or "every American should see this movie".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's "The Bridge" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be "good" or "best"? "Saving Private Ryan" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with "Schindler's List", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from "Come and See". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a valid portrayal of Neptune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Saving Pvt Ryan is that is is basically afraudulent portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Every single detail may, for all I know, be authentic for the group portrayed, which I assume was Goranson's Company C, 2nd Rangers. But that company, with one notable exception, experienced the worst that Omaha Beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 0630-0800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (Col Schneider) (6 companies) landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded. It all depended on where your landing craft touched down (or allowed it to touch down - Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was , Dog Green, but had the sense to order the craft eastward), and Capt Hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes, they didn't crawl up, inch by inch, etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes - very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14,000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves (0630-0800)was not much over 10%, far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disasters,etc. Beside, Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of non-existent eyewitnesses.( It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to "authenticate" the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers). Anyone who sees Pvt Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenes,the rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase : "Call the 101st on the radio, and tell them to pull Ryan from the line." That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan, while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then, that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be (I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together - they would never have done that ) the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story, although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait, as is obvious from the casualties taken (approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces "O" and "B" (60,000 troops)).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What exactly are you trying to say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start let me say that this movie was extremely well crafted, pushing the envelope in the technical aspect of filmmaking.This movie was really good if looked at in parts. The opening D-DAY sequence was beautiful. The final battle was also great. There were moments that really grabbed you (the Giovanni Ribisi monologue especially) but the film as a whole makes no sense.It said nothing. It simply contradicted itself over and over agian. The great D-DAY sequence tells us about the insanity of war, and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is. But after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing, the movie goes full circle right into hollywood. The ending attempts to justify all the madness, by saying that it's all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country (as we fade out on the american flag). Mr. Speilberg and company, What exactly are you trying to tell us?NOTE: This movie pales in comparison to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.Although I must say, if it came down to this movie and Shakespeare in love (perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar... oh wait thats titanic), I would have to go with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy reigns supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg just about had it here, at least for the first half hour or so. He looked at the bone-crunching, grisly history of D-day and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality. Then, with his Hollywood sellout lack of vision, Spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy. The 'true' story the film may be based on has some chaplain in France discovering Ryan after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to America so his mother still has one child to work the farm. Or, the story could be straight out of the writer's head but it hardly matters. The premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a half-hour of complete slaughter, the seas red with human blood and gore. We are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over Private Ryan and his family while the assault on Normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives, while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and Hitler's machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass. What romantic rubbish and so typical of Hollywood. And the portrayal of the German prisoner is morally offensive. The German people have never been less human than Americans, even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war. To portray them as Spielberg does the prisoner, a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake, hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an American chest, is low-brow, hateful stuff. But nobody is going to notice. Believe me. In fact, we love to see the world in black and white, simplistic terms. Here come the Oscars for Spielberg. Americans (and my own Canadians too) are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves. Capital 'D' Denial reigns supreme, especially at the box-office. Spielberg's big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth. If he'd stayed on the beach at Omaha, he'd have a nine out of ten. Instead, he rates several points less for this updated version of that old T.V. series called Combat. Please see Amy Taubin's review at the following URL. It's much more articulate and generous than mine. http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/film/30taubin.shtml</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not history, although ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to love a war movie, which just like 'Goonies' is based around a serious of characters, all of which have one defining characteristic, and go on a quest, finding out who they are along the way.As 'Goonies' had the fat kid, the Asian genius, the smart-arse; 'Ryan' has the religious guy, the cowardly guy, and smart-arse, among others. As the 'Goonies' fought impossible odds, so too do the American soldiers of the 'Ryan' cast.And WWII is seen as it really happened, with the Heroic American's fighting for the cause of good single-handedly, against those crazy Germans! Canadian's, British, French, and even Commonwealth soldiers don't feature on this Western front. And nor would they, with this being an American film starring Tom Hanks, they should be neglected from such "history". There's only room for the central character's and there quest for flag waving glory!When this film was first released it was sold as being so accurate it was a history lesson within a piece of entertainment. But blood and guts don't make for accuracy. And American's, for whom this was meant only saw war as a glorious celebration of the stars-n-stripes. To this day, America has used WWII not as a warning, but as a starting point. Lost in this film was the supposed anti-war message, with nationalism the resounding lesson that this filth passed onto it's American viewers. George W. Bush must surely love this piece of violent film making at it's worst.Forget about this Goonies rip, and just check out the original, it's far less offensive, and a lot more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: " Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The message appears to have been the first casualty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action scenes in this film are superb - gritty, realistic and plain nasty. However, it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flag-waving patriotism. What is the message of this film? That occasionally you find SOMETHING worth fighting and dying for or that it's glorious to die for your country (read Owen for further comments on this)Something else it has led to is a number of American reviewers giving the "We died to save your a$$es" speach. This itself is both stupid and untrue - the people who wrote those messages did nothing. America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is ? just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed ? I found the chaos comparable to the scene in `Platoon' where they assault the V.C. bunker?however, it does not (any part of the movie, in my mind) match up the finale of Platoon, in which one is so confused, your heart pounds, and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in Private Ryan.What really got to me about this film, were several things though?first and foremost, is the `dumb German' syndrome, which leaves me with a bias feeling. Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with almost twenty German's firing at them?Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mine?or hit by a grenade?so on, so on. I won't pretend to be a war-vet, or someone who's witnessed this, but it seems unlikely to me. However, I'll stress my own ignorance, and say `don't take my word for it.'All in all, I found it to be a worthy action flick ? comparable, in my mind, to `The Big Red one.' It has sad moments, and moments of brutality, but in the end, just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequences.As a sidenote, I think that the best ww2 films ever made are "The Thin Red Line" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" two films that don't deal heaviliy with combat (TTRL more so). Saving Private Ryan tried just a little to hard to force feed it. I recomend all of these films, but for your knowledge, those are to me, the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read most of the comments about SPR and I must say I agree with those who resent and loathe the film. I went to see it last week, and I was terribly disappointed. I was disappointed mainly because of the: 1. The sentimental awkward frame 2. The vomit-inducing score 3.Rotten dialog 4. Moral hypocrisy But most of all I was disappointed by the predictability of the plot. We all know from the beginning who will die and how. It is no surprise that Tom Sizemore.. dies last followed by Hanks..maybe this is the love-story of the film? When the best buddy dies Hanks literally throws himself at the bullets. American films don't really need women basically it's all about bonding in the forceful wilderness.. if it isn't Indians it's Germans and the rest of the world doesn't exist not even in Europe.I know these comments may be a trifle vengeful or sarcastic but I love movies I am not one of those freaks who only watch French films and thinks everything else is crap.But I HATE to be disappointed when I've had such great expectations. I totally agree with the comment on the motivations of the geek character shooting the runaway German. What was that all about? Wasn't the point of his release to show that the geek was more humane than the rest of them? The knife scene seems rather erotized to me two men so close to death(and not the little one I may add)and penetration, whispering ..slowly, slowly in German. I find this extremely disturbing where does this fit in? I don't have much else to say but I have lost my faith in Spielberg's abilities(What's the point of having a sniper citing from the bible?)As far as I am concerned he hasn't made a thrilling scene since Dreyfuss built that mountain in his living room in close encounter, and that moment is far more realistic than any scene in SPR !!!! What is the difference between this film and other violent films that earn money? The plot structure is exactly the same, the characters are the same, the music is the same. (The moral is the same pasted nicely to a waving American flag) The only difference is that something similar (so realistic...)happened in the past. If people can become wealthy this way I have given my support to Spielberg's bank account for the very last time. The best war film ever made is still STALINGRAD!!!!!!!!!!! But I guess no American will know this before someone makes an American version all I can say is : I hope it wont be Spielberg..</fullReview>

The acting is terrible especially by Vin Diesel, how the heck did he get that role anyway? The plot was ridiculous and boring, the script was very poorly written and over all I am disappointed in both Tom Hanks and Mr. Spielberg. Now I know Spielberg loves to make movies about that era, of course he was too young for that war and too old for the next one, but hey, he's richer then god, he can exploit anything he wants. The movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy. (best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to rescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat. So almost every man from Hanks' squad dies but eventually Ryan gets saved. The Germans, of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men. In reality the war was fought by a bunch of twenty-somethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into. But the Hanks-Spielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers. So do yourself a favor, skip renting this, pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of B of B. It's a true story based on real heroes of WWII, and the acting is not bad. Thats all. Save your money if you want to see saving private ryan, wait for it to come on ABC.</fullReview>

The first twenty minutes, I accept are excellent, but they are just a rip off of someone else's hard work - and frankly I would rather see the original footage from the Second World War rather than the director's interpretation of it. Although it tried to be realistic and historical, it was neither. The history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic. (I imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummie's boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base.)

It's nice to see protagonists who aren't superhuman, but this is only a (moderately) original take for big budget blockbusters, it's hardly ground breaking cinema.Just as in Starship Troopers, the characters barely qualify as one dimensional, and I can't be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that SPR almost qualifies as a parody.A particular point of interest is that Mr Spielberg's Evil Nazi Scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the Bugs in Starship Troopers. If you get your knowledge of history from Hollywood (which a lot of people do), then you'd be forgiven for thinking that every single German was a soulless Nazi who deserved to die, and that WWII was just USA vs Japan and Germany. I do have a fair amount of sympathy for Spielberg's stance, but it's interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930's Nazi anti-Jewish, anti-Romany propaganda. It's sad but not really surprising that Spielberg's audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the German moviegoers did in the 1930's.The idea for SPR is actually sound, but the implementation is just so overdone that I really can't bring myself to care about any of it, other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history. If I'm going to watch good-vs-bad fantasy, I'd prefer to stick with Starship Troopers which at least doesn't try to pass itself off as something significant and profound.</fullReview>

To dislike Schindler's List is to not be sympathetic with the Jews who were killed by Nazis. To dislike Forrest Gump is to not be properly respectful of retarded people. Give me a break. Now we're all supposed to like Saving Private Ryan because if we don't it means we don't understand that war is bad or appreciate the sacrifice made by all the people who died during WW II? Spare me.Without all the emotional baggage, SPR is an awful movie. The plot is trite. The writing labored and formulaic and it in no way justifies the emotional bludgeoning delivered by the opening sequence.I will admit that the opening sequences is probably the most powerful half hour of film ever to be projected on a movie screen. Spielberg know all the emotional buttons we have and how to push them. He was a brilliantly manipulative filmmaker 25 years ago and he's only gotten better. That being said, did Mr. Spielberg forget to actually add a story? Lots of movies deal with the ugly side of humanity. The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect example of how to show these things in the context of a riveting story. I guess the most disappointing aspect of this is that we all know that Spielberg can do better. He has done better. He has made some of the greatest American films of all time. He, of all people, should remember that and remember that every time he makes one of these ponderous abominations he is desecrating the memory of films like Duel and Jaws... and even The Lost World. It was a far better movie than this.On a scale of 1 to 10. I gave it a 1 only because there was no zero which was what it really deserved.</fullReview>

Also, studies have been done showing that only about 1/3 of American troops landing during D-Day fired their rifles. Not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be. It's laughable that people call this film "realistic."The audience is given very little credit. The dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission. It's as though Spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail.It also overused action sequences. Those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty, excessive scenes of violence. All in all, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes: reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah. Also painfully stereotypical are the characters: we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life, we've got the hardnut sergeant, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the New Yorker, and so forth. And all the Germans are skinheaded bastards - and by the way, where the hell were the other allied troops? Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring. Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome. The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.Then there's the final battle. Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator). Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.5 Oscars? Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved. Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world. Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line. I suppose the two sound awards are justified.For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now. This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is. This can't even be described as the best D-Day/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**. To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film. Schindler's List is superior.To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked. If you haven't seen it, don't bother. Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave/press stop. You'll be doing yourself a big favour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful movie (some spoilers)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing Saving Private Ryan. I had heard many reviews that called it one of the greatest war movies ever made. I was not expecting to see something as poorly put together as this movie was. From the begining I found myself wanting to scream at the screen. I must admit the acting was good, but they had little to work with.Just about every other aspect of the film fails. It manages to portray D-Day as the smallest battle I've ever seen. Basically, the goal was two machine gun posts. Sorry, but that battle was not realistic at all and was intentionally bloodwashed worst than the Friday the 13th movies. The film is loaded with mistakes including the rediculous helmet rank insignia. They knew better because they told someone not to salute Hanks because it might give away his rank. Then they put bars on his helmet! Structurally, the movie was a disaster. It was supposed to be about the irony of many men dying for one man. In the end, though it turns into the defense of a bridge and the main plot is almost totally forgotten. The soldiers are stupid. They have to defend or destroy a bridge, but don't leave the detonator wired up and someone (who should have been Ryan) to blow it as a last resort? Every war cliche in the book gets dropped into this film. "Save my child", the wounded soldier just out of reach, the sharpshooter who never misses, "I'm not leaving my buddies", etc. They are all there. Did they have to end the the waiving of the flag?The movie does not feel like WWII, but rather feels like Vietnam. Lots of mud and rain, "what are we doing here", a bungling military command. One of the most successful engagements in military history is portrayed as a confused, poorly planned mess.The movie is absolutely loaded with red herrings. Hank's hand problem has no bearing on the plot and is not present when it might cause a problem. They fight a machine-gun nest for no real reason other than it provided a fight scene. Was I the only one to notice that all of the towns were destroyed before we even got to them? Didn't France surrender? The climactic battle is sure to be lost, but is won when air support arrives. Of course, they did not call for the air support. Can you say "Deus ex machina"? Did we have precision guided tank bombs in WWII? Did our protagonists really have anything to do with the outcome?I was shocked that this movie was not ripped apart in reviews. It has everything possible wrong with it. Is it now unpatriotic to indicate divel when you see it wrapped with an American flag?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best War Movie out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a military movie based during World War II. The movie starts with the invasion of Normandy at what is now known as D Day. Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks, leads his troops onto the beaches of Normandy against the Germans. Once they are able to take the beach, they learn of story of Private James Ryan. James and his other four brothers are scattered throughout Europe battling in World War II. The United States Headquarters learns that all of James's brothers have been killed in action, leaving James the only sibling to survive. The United States Military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action. In a plot to give his mother some type of comfort, the Military sends Captain Miller and his troops on a hunt to find Private Ryan and tell him what had happened and to get him back home.The theme of the film is courage. Throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end. The soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from World War II and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach. After they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find Private Ryan. They had to search throughout Europe to find Ryan while going through several battles and their own battles with each other. They lost many men including Corporal Caparzo. All of those men lost, just so that they could get Private Ryan and send him home to his mother.Lighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer, and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life. When Caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark, it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog. The surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there. The sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in. It makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if that's how it really was.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best military movies of all time. The courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic. They made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in World War II. This movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take away the gratuitously gory opening scenes, and what you have is an average war movie. Yes, war is hell, but just being explicit about what a bullet or shell can do to a human body isn't going to turn you against war. Personally I found this movie exploitative.If you want to see what the effects of the Second World War were really like, then ignore the movies. Instead check out the classic seventies series 'The World at War'. Far more shocking and sickening than any Hollywood blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematography the only redeeming thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard so many great things about 'Saving Private Ryan' that my curiosity for this movie turned to pure shock as I watched it. I have to say that I really do not like war movies, so thats an obvious bias against this movie, but there were sooooooooooo many things about this movie that just made it a laughing stock of me and my friends. The cinematography in this film is simply amazing, in fact i'd say some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, but despite it's technical excellence, SPR is a pathetic, manipulative attempt by Speilberg to make him feel better about himself. The only character development in the movie takes place in the scenes before that particular character's death, it's happens in EVERY case; it's like clockwork. The ending is absolutely horrendously manipulative, and in fact the whole story doesn't really make sense as a result of it. SPOILER ALERT - don't read any farther if ya don't want to ruin the flick for yourself. At the beginning we have the shot of that old man at the grave, then it closes in on him and his memory begins of what happened... the only thing is that we find out the old man is really Ryan, not Tom Hank's Character, so i'm wondering how Ryan has all these memories of the beaches and the rest of the movie. Theoretically shouldn't the 'memories' start when Ryan enters the movie? Oh well, I can see arguments against my point, but the use of some certain camera angles REALLY makes the point of saying that the old man is Tom Hanks. I found this movie, above all things (even manipulative) to be extremely boring. Here's another case of a movie that had a about a 12 minute story stretched out to infinity. There are hundreds of little things that made me laugh about this movie in the wrong way, and obviously I won't go into all of them but I do feel this movie makes the German Armies look rediculous, specifically in the tank scene. There is many shots of the American soldiers running across open areas with dozens of germans shooting at them but they hardly ever get shot, while the Americans seem to hit somebody with every single bullet, and three people with every explosive. Other humorous moments include Tom Hanks diffusing a potentially hostile situation by telling everybody that hes a school teacher and the weak,poetry loving-'i've never shot anybody'- soldier killing a guy for no real reason in the situation. The performances were pretty good, I guess, but the script was so laughable that most of the things the guys say make you crack up no matter how well they say them. If you wanna see a good war movie, see Platoon, or if you hate war movies like I do, and you feel like watching a war satire, check out Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it weren't for the group of people with a personal hatred of America and our military, this movie would have a higher overall rating on IMDb. This movie is phenomenal. From the horrific depiction of D-Day in Normandy to the final battle, this movie keeps you entertained and worried for the safety of the main characters. This movie will tug at your heartstrings if you have a heart. The acting really draws you in and the plot, while a little out there, is very engaging and creates for an amazing journey behind enemy lines.This movie will forever be the greatest war movie ever made. The brutal realism and gore are hard to watch at times but is necessary to fully show the horrors of war.All I can say about this movie is don't expect your favorite characters to make it out alive. I was pretty upset originally when my two favorite characters in the movie died, but that just adds to the realism of the movie. People died. Your friends died. Heroes died. War is Hell, and full of heroic sacrifices. This movie is a must see for any American, though I believe foreigners should enjoy this movie as well. An excellent 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie in which the American fighting man is portrayed as weak, stupid, untrained, and rebellious.The Captain won't help a family get out of harm's way, but has no trouble assaulting a radar tower. Stupid. In one case, take ten seconds and point to the avenue of escape. In the other, avoid the tower; it's not the mission.A well-manned squad has a sniper and a translator, but not a radioman or a machine gunner. What? Bullets slice easily through all helmets except one. They wanted the irony of the guy pulling off his helmet and then getting the head shot.The Star Trek philosophy of the Captain being challenged every step by his subordinates. Might be the way it works in space. Didn't happen in WWII. More people die when you "put it to a vote." Snipers die when they fire continuously. Not their job. The German ate it because he tried to take everybody out; the American did the same.A sniper's basic job in battle is to make the enemy keep low and go slow. He takes out the head (officers and radiomen), the muscle (mostly machine gunners, bazookas, and BARs, or the morale (medics). If the bad guys take out your chain of command, take away your strength, or take away any hope of surviving a wound, you tend not to fight as well.If your man throws a hissy fit and wants to desert, you help him. Not gonna happen. Even if you are a pacifist piece of crap like the Captain, you have to keep your unit cohesive.Tanks enter a hot zone in a city without firing a shot. Stupid. Tanks, like planes, provide massive firepower but also huge targets. The Queen of Battle takes the cities. Tanks avoid them and fire at them from a distance. Tank busters wouldn't have been used in this situation. They probably would have taken out the very bridge that both sides wanted to own, but neither side wanted to destroy.You let the rookie hang back and cry. No. If you don't want to fight with the rest of us, you can do your part by attracting bullets.The way to infiltrate the enemy lines is to crowd together, joke, and sing while you walk along through the pretty fields. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Spread out; keep quiet; learn how to use the 1,000 yard stare.A Captain loses 96 men and rationalizes that he saved 10 times that amount. Not in our Army. I waited for him to say 104. That would have been believable, but I guess this Captain was leading a battalion, not a company. And somehow, he ends up leading not a battalion, not a company, not a platoon, but a mere squad. Most likely, a buck sarge or a corporal would have led that squad.Non-combat pencil jockeys call the shots as the Normandy Invasion is going on. Uh, no.If you have a prisoner, you let him go while you dig graves. No, to letting him go. No, to digging graves during battle. You take care of the living first; and of the living, you take care of your own men first.Although communication was atrocious, all platoons had a radioman, and some squads did. The proper place for a radioman is two feet to the rear of the Captain at all times.The horrid portrayal of the American fighting man goes on and on. They weren't wimps. Yes, everyone was scared silly, but they didn't challenge every fricking order. If you are part of the 10% of the Army known as line soldiers, the chances are good that you are not coming back. You know that going in.War is terrible. You don't want to experience it. But if you have to, try to be like the sarge. Don't be stupid like the sniper, cowardly like the translator, "conflicted" like Hanks, treasonous like what's his name, etc.And Private Ryan himself. At that cemetery, he should have been thinking about all the men he killed, not whether he lived up to the Captain's standards. He killed the Captain and most of his men. A fitting end would have Ryan eating a bullet.The Screaming Eagles (Puking Chickens) and the Rangers were highly trained. They weren't wimps. They didn't have anybody in their units who was untrained in rifle fire. They knew that their job was to do the heaviest fighting and take the bloodiest losses. Every one of them knew how to fire, how to bandage a wound, how to use a radio, bazooka, Garand, BAR, how to lead. When one went down, another would take his place. Battlefield promotions were never more prevalent than in those units.Those men volunteered to be in those units. They might have been drafted, but they chose to join the roughest and most courageous outfits that we had.I salute our fighting men. Although I was a ground pounder, my contribution to American freedom was relatively small and insignificant. I only hope that I could have acted like one of the few valiant soldiers portrayed here.And as to the movie itself: Shameful. Utterly shameful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Great' is such a big word, you can fill it with so many expressions like spectacular, thrilling, heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, emotional, inspirational etc. etc. My problem with "Saving Private Ryan" is that it has all these elements but still ... at the end, I have a big feeling of 'emptiness', it's like all these things cancel each other out.The opening sequence is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see in a War movie, Spielberg knows how to deal with visual effects and the sound editing, the shaky movements of the camera gives a realistic depiction of the chaos dominating these battles, even the word 'battle' is too feeble to describe the intensity of the massacre. The sky is gray on this D-Day, the sea is reddened by the sacrifice of these young soldiers, the air is a vicious enemy that can send you a bullet where it feels like to. Your life is as worthless as money in a lottery. Indeed this opening sequence was very promising, but I had mixed feelings after. I hoped the movie would stay in the same level of realism and greatness on one side. On the other side, I wished it wouldn't contain other sickeningly violent sequences. Unfortunately, none of these wishes were satisfied.The film flirts with fantasy right after the battle sequence, where the mission of Captain Miller's men is finally exposed. They will have to save one soldier, Private Ryan, the only one left to a family who already lost 3 sons, his brothers. To spare a tragedy for one soldier's family, eight of them will try to find him and risk their lives. We don't know this Ryan yet, he's only a name, a quest, but we get used to these characters, we follow them and have sympathy for them, but at each step of their odyssey, one will be killed. It becomes almost a routine. We're not supposed to think of their family, or the loss caused by this mission. They just die and the mission must go on. It seems that Ryan's life has more value. At this point, I remember "Schindler's List" beautiful statement "Whoever saves one life, saves the humanity" but the people who were saved, didn't choose their destiny, they were victims, the alternative was death. Ryan wanted to be a soldier, to fight, he never wanted to be saved, isn't the movie about duty, wasn't Ryan accomplishing his? So what's the point of risking the lives of soldiers who want to fight instead of looking for a man who's not a prisoner, to save one who didn't ask for it. Nonsense, and dangerous reasoning implying that some 'external' elements make your life more valuable than the others.Which in fact, brings me to the biggest problem I had with the film. Life's value. The movies tries to be inspiring by making these soldiers heroes, but to make them heroes, it creates villains by totally dehumanizing the enemy, when a War movie makes me cheer for one human being killed, I feel manipulated, and I become distant ... when a coward like Upham becomes Rambo at the end, and when Steamboat Willie revealed himself as the sneaky bastard they thought he was ... I said, okay, Spieleberg is pushing the Manichean button a little too far. Of course, when you consider the atrocities committed by the enemy, it's impossible to root for the soldiers equally, but that's the challenge when you make a war movie, you can make a Manichean blockbuster (easy choice) or a disturbing masterpiece (challenge) ... I disliked "Saving Private Ryan" for the same reason I loved "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" or "Das Boot".This movie is great in all the meanings of the word and that's the problem, it's "too great", it tries too much ... I loved the opening scene, and another one will torture me forever, it's the scene where Melish begs for his life when he lost the fight, that part killed me ... it felt so real, I couldn't breath ... literally. To conclude, a solid block-buster movie with some unforgettable scenes but not the inspirational masterpiece they claim it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Overrated Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks "Saving Private Ryan" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's "The Thin Red Line," that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mission Is The Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately, when Hollywood produces war movies, they focus on the debacle of Vietnam. Not director Steven Spielberg! Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of "Jaws," "Schindler's List," "The Color Purple," and "Jurassic Park" skewers a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy "Saving Private Ryan." "Saving Private Ryan" ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed. As demeaning as this criticism sounds, "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the top 25 World War II movies. Since "Saving Private Ryan" swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down" and Sylvester Stallone's "Rambo" have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence. If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, "Saving Private Ryan" might have been a classic. Essentially, "Saving Private Ryan" is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic. Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye. This is an egregious error! During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head. Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except that the film itself raises the same point. A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption. These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat. Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie. Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale. Told from the perspective of the infantry, "Saving Private Ryan" is a movie in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic "All Quiet on the Western Front," Samuel Fuller's "The Big Red One," Lewis Milestone's "A Walk in the Sun," and William Wellman's "Background." Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that "Saving Private Ryan" commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories. The muddled but high-minded screenplay by "Fly Away House" scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper. Captain Miller assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate Private James Ryan of Iowa. Ryan (Matt Damon of "Good Will Hunting") has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion. When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of "Fargo") decides to pull the last Ryan out of action. Along the way, Miller's G.I.s bitch about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy. Before "Saving Private Ryan" grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious. Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank "The Shawshank Redemption" Darabont, seem confused. Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie? Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer? They pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies. Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence. Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas. The sadistic horrors that occur in "Saving Private Ryan" seems more commercially than philosophically oriented. We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.The first 24 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach. Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery. This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics. After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders. Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines. Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch. Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst. This part of "Saving Private Ryan" has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show "Combat." Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders. Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise. Many soldiers have commented?among them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell?that Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated. Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities. The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera. The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops. "Saving Private Ryan," for all its obvious flaws, still qualifies a movie any die-hard World War II fanatic should watch at least three times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie could have ended after twenty minutes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, come on, this flick is nothing but patriotic filth! The first twenty minutes are an accurate and meticulous portrayal of the Normandy landing, and the cinematography is just beautiful! But the story, the plot: forget it! I believe it is very unlikely that any superior in the military would send a whole platoon on such a BS assignment! And when they finally find Matt Damon aka Ryan he heroically wants to fight on and not leave the battle field! Ridiculous. This is popcorn BS for the masses and it makes me angry how Spielberg exploits an actual event in history to make some entertaining, overly corny and almost nationalistic movie out of it! I think that Spielberg displays a lack of responsibility, because this movie has the following messages: 1.Americans fought bravely against the Nazis and all of them believed they were fighting for a worthy cause. 2. American men are young and handsome, and if not, they are smart or wise. 3. All Germans are bad Nazis and ugly, too. 4. The Americans are superheros. 5. There was no anti-smut's within the American army. Well, people believe what they want to believe, and the more simplified the message is, the more they are willing to swallow it. If you want to take a deeper look into the real character of the American army, read books such as Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, but refrain from Spielberg, who is nothing but a lowbrow trying to look smart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of me picking this the best war film ever, I choose it as the most overrated film of all time. An entire squadron would not be sent into uncertain territory just to bring back one man who really had no purpose to be saved. There were several others out there just like him, I'm sure. All of the people who didn't deserve to survive did. This movie was just a load of it. Definetly not Spielberg's best and not Hank's best role.

		<fullReview>I'm a WW2 and war movies fan.I thought I made that clear from the start.I gave "The Dirty Dozen" and "Platoon" 10 points,and I'm not a particularly indulgent reviewer.So,even though it was directed by Spielberg,which I don't like as a director,I had high hopes for it,simply because I saw the beginning Normandy landing scene in a preview and I was amazed by its force and grandeur.Also the actors were terrific,Hanks,Sizemore,Pepper...But goddamn you Spielberg,you really know how to put poop sauce in our spaghetti,don't you? American flag...American flag...old tear-eyed guy reminiscing...comforting family...American flag...a tombstone...American flag...I GET IT, Spielberg,give me a break....then,nice war scenes in Northern France...and the poop sauce really starts to hit the spaghetti...absolutely unrecognizable German Wehrmacht...now I won't rant about historical inaccuracies and plot absurdities ('though there are plenty),but most of those guys looked like zombies,not German soldiers. One thing is certain: Spielberg has no idea about war, not really.He's talented enough to draw it for us,but shallow enough to be clueless about what it is about.So, yes, I watched the Normandy landing scene and the end battle scene 3 times...guilty pleasure I guess...and I fast-forwarded all else...including the very end,which was as melodramatic and pretentious and naive as almost the whole picture.So,4 points for the effort,the actors,the battles...(the spaghetti). The rest was,as I mentioned, poop sauce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Action Film But Nothing Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Saving Private Ryan I was very exited since all my friends said it was an awesome and realistic war film. The truth was far from that. The first 5 minutes of the movie were excellent but it was all downfall after that, since the "storyline" doesn't make any sense at all why in god's name would the U.S Army send a small group of Soldiers after a single soldier who is lost possibly behind enemy lines possibly KIA or Captured. The whole operation would be a total waste of men and equipment. Also the Rangers did not operate in such small groups on special missions and the lack of any intelligence of Ryan's whereabouts would make the operation a waste of time, also the Germans don't seem to have any sort of intellgence this kissed good bye to realism alongside the "10 Dead Germans to 1Dead American" rule. When an American is hit he dies usually slowly and dramaticly saying something like "Take this letter to my mother " etc etc, when the enemy dies quick and is rarely or never injured. The portrayal of the enemy is ridiculous. The enemy doesen't have a face, a personality or any feelings the enemy is just a sadistic and evil killing machine. Saving Private Ryan does not differ from old propaganda films made during and slightly after the war. The reason I gave it a 5 was that it had some decent action in it but movie is overwhelmed with Spielberg's/Americans propaganda. I would not call this movie realistic under any circumstances. In short: Good : -First 5 minutes on the Beach -Some good action scenes Bad: -Propaganda -Pointless Storyline</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered by many to be a fantastic film, I feel I must have missed something. This film is certainly a good film by any standards. (The camera work is well done, backdrops are excellent and the opening scene on the beaches of Normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema history) But the film does suffer from a couple of failings.Firstly, it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic. The film beings and ends with the American flag, and the in fact, the Americans appear to be the only people in the film. The only appearances from other nationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a back-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough diamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a tear-jerking moment of sadness.Secondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat silly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks. I really don't understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousness.In conclusion, I'd say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the movie was switched off. None the less, I would recommend viewing this film, as its qualities do outshine the flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A myopic, americentric view of the human side of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it came out, Saving Private Ryan was lauded for it's "realistic depiction of war," and for its "attention and sensitivity to the common man caught up in the sway of forces far beyond his control." It was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the war.Unfortunately, it was none of these things.The message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience, as long as you're an American. Common everyday plain old American Teachers, as shown by Tom Hanks' character, are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men. We are shown, however, that the humanity of that Teacher is still there, even as he is fighting the "Evil Bloodthirsy Germans."And this is where my problem lies. How can a movie that uses cookie cutter Nazis, that treats German soldiers as simply "the enemy," even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans in Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently having lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The Thin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a joke.Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so flat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either. Having said that, however, the dehumanizing of the enemy, the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity, is what allowed the Germans to kill so many Jews.This movie is anything but a realistic depiction of the Second World War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest War Movies of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Together with "Schindler's List (1993) and "Platoon" (1986), "Saving Private Ryan" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like "Platoon" it gives the viewer an "in the trenches" experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as you've heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent ? visceral, terrifying and all too real ? conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given "Saving Private Ryan" a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during WWII (they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war). But don't get me wrong: watching the movie, you can literally feel the bullets hitting you. Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters themselves. Aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all Americans out to be good and all Germans out to be bad, the Americans are basically clichés. They're all wholesome, hard-working guys out to make something of themselves. Moreover, there's the wise-guy New Yorker and the cowpoke Southerner, and Pvt. Ryan comes from Iowa (read: America's heartland).But otherwise, it's a very good movie, and it goes to show what an incredible director Steven Spielberg is (although I still wouldn't have given the movie Best Picture; I would have given that to "Life is Beautiful"). Also starring Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti and Dennis Farina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many Hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most amazing movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until this day, there had never been a time where I was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie. Never. Then, I saw Saving Private Ryan. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen.Saving Private Ryan is a very accurate presentation of World War 2. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Spielburg's camera-work, which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier. I felt like I was running along the beaches of Normandy. I felt like I was with them in the final battle (won't reveal specifics). That's how good it was! Now, even though this movie is really good, it is not for the faint of heart. The first scene of this movie (D-Day) contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. They do not hold back on the violence. So, unless you think you can handle it, I would not recommend seeing this movie, because it does have some very disturbing moments. Another thing they do not hold back on is swearing. If soldiers shouting out the f-word constantly doesn't appeal to you, then you might want to skip this movie.Besides all of that, this is a great film! I can't think of anything wrong with it at all. I would definitely recommend this movie (if you can handle the gore and language).</fullReview>

I think this guy would be better in doing commercials for TV than making movie - just my humble opinion. But if we forget some flaws the movie is pretty good ! T. Hanks was also very good in it ! he got my respect.now, some stuff was bothering :- near the beginning, why spielberg was making the little french girl say " i don't like those american soldiers ! -sob- " Are those US dudes will stop one day to think that the french are genetically antiamerican ? that's ridiculous ! I hate set ideas !- The german soldiers look dumb and wanting very eagerly take some US slug in the map ! Come on, guys ! The germans are just there to be shooted, they act stupidly what cost them their life, they have no survivng instinct ... i don't buy it !- The landing scene seemed ended a little too fast and easily to match the reality i think (IMHO)Of course, there may be a little too much US patriotism for the average european viewer, we are not used to it anymore in our countries (self-glorification, i mean) but after all it's an american movie and they did change the fate of Europe and the world, so ... let them do it.anyway good movie, i give it a 8/10.= you should at least see it once ! &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar. It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his "real" film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup). And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all ? how could it not? ? and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil. You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours ? the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some ? especially when a strict genre film is coming ? can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps "Pan's Labyrinth," but that setup was disjointed. So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Neither did I, but that's what Mr. Spielberg would like everyone who watches the movie to believe. And what about the young American soldiers fighting this war in 1944? In the film they talked the way young people talk today.

		<shortDescription>A harrowing and powerful experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** out of ****Five years can really put a lot in perspective. At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.The question is: how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre. It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective. Whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably won't reach any satisfying conclusion. Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic. Viewers should at least be open-minded enough to absorb the film's moral quandaries, they're partially the glue that holds the film together.The camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film. There's an equal mix of humor, tension, respect, and pathos between these men. Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler: oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous. Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality. SPR is no different, there's a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments, but to say it didn't affect me would be a complete lie. I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be.</fullReview>

In this movie a platoon of 20 US soldiers, takes out 100 German soldiers, 2 Marder IIIs and 2 Tiger tanks with improvised weapons like wet-sock bombs and Molotov cocktails. Real history accounts SHOW that this never happened! If your into entertaining and action packed War movies THEN THIS IS TOTALLY YOUR THING! A great movie! However 98% inaccurate when it comes to history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Takes Us To War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of Steven Spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience, and then takes them there. If he wants to tug at our heartstrings, he'll make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque. If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White. And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>D-Day. Operation Overlord. What we say here cannot do justice to what they did on that day. Tom Hanks and his patrol must recover Private James Ryan before his mother gets her fourth flag delivered by an Army chaplain. It all makes perfect, illogical sense to kill many to save one. After surviving the Normandy landing, Hanks is volunteered to put his men in the line of fire again and again. Just to save one man. Or is it?A bridge is saved, a town is secured, a bigger battle is won..All because Hanks saved one shoe for one horse...Beautifully realistic to make the atrocities of war invade, assault, and overpower all five senses. You feel the bullets whizzing past your head. You see the man looking for his arm after it was blown off is shoulder. You smell the burning hatred for the Nazis as one US soldier yells to his comrades "Don't shoot them..let them burn." It is too much to watch..but you have to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dozen for the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when Spielberg felt the film-making fraternity had overlooked him. Those days may be over, but the reasons why it happened, sadly, are not. The lesson seems to be, make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweight.The sad fact is that Schindler's List is (in my opinion) a very good film, but not a great one ? it is too heavy handed. I am in a minority. Likewise, bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography (which was not part of the original Spielberg grand plan) and transform a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal war-is-naughty-but-devilishly-exciting flick into a major cinematic event.Can someone who loves this film as Art (I choose capitals for its ironic effect) explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games? Were Spielberg's motives so noble, so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his "war-is-naughty" message to the fans of first person shoot-em-ups? Now you may argue that it is hardly Spielberg's job to worry about such things. This may be true ? but you have to wonder why it was that Saving Private Ryan is so eminently suited to such a transfer. It is difficult, for example, to anticipate a Thin Red Line or Apocalypse now video game. It would also difficult to paste scenes from Thin Red Line onto, say, Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon coming out of the sun, for example) and not be able to spot the difference.At best Saving Private Ryan is a lukewarm, melodramatic, overly sentimental paean to good ole America, good ole family and the importance of killing nasty Germans before they kill you. The beach landing is extraordinary ? I'm not denying it. But pardon me if I'm holding out for something more subtle. 5? /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect war movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, "Saving Private Ryan" is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feeding the arrogance of the baby-boomer generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a younger man (22) I've grown up in a society was molded to fit baby-boomer self-centeredness. So perhaps I shouldn't find this film surprising. But I can't stomach the idea of another generation of people following their twisted view, so here goes...No matter how much you want to stoke your own ego, there is no way that you can realistically equate the men who fought and died in WW2 to yourselves. Give up. This film is a terrible blow to our veterans.Spielberg tries to make the soldiers seem like they're the same as you and me, but they weren't. All of the introspective musings in this film would make you think that these guys returned home after the war and started discussing Sartres in their local coffeehouse. These are 40's people who are portrayed thinking like 90's people. At least in "Thin Red Line", the film made no effort to portray itself as a true-to-life salute to those soldiers. "Thin Red Line" was a juxtaposition of a WW2 backdrop with Vietnam-era sentiments, and it made to portent of being anything else.The WW2 generation didn't feel this ridiculous desire to explore their feelings and share them to the point of fault. They didn't have to connect to their fellows on some mystical, spiritual level. The entire war did not revolve around them as individuals, nor did they feel the need to ponder some existential connection to the war around them.This film is simply another attempt by the baby-boomer generation to "prove" that they are as good as any other generation before them. This is their self-centered mythos. If a film actually showed the superior qualities of these American soldiers, it would destroy that myth. In truth, the American people felt a duty to their country back then. And they did not feel the need to wax philosophic at every turn in some attempt to justify the world's existence in the face of how "inconvenient" it may have been to their own selves. This contemporary psycho-babble had no place in their lives, and Spielberg had no right to put it there.As for the characters who don't partake of this attitude, they are so paper thin that they add nothing to the film except to exacerbate the problem by making the mystics and coffeehouse types seem the more realistic.If you have any respect for America, pass this film by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg's usual homey touch (which infiltrated even "Schlinder's List" in its final act) is thankfully in slight evidence here, as WWII soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat. The set-up for the plot is a bit formulaic (and layered with Spielberg's need for romanticism), but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable. Vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won Oscars, as did Spielberg (who deserved it). I was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is, given the feel-good reputations by many of the principals involved. I'm not a lover of this particular movie genre, but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie We Don't Need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is nothing but a dummy package. Under the guise of a feigned authenticity - the construction of unreflecting patriotism, tear-jerking worship of heroes, a naive black-and-white portrayal and a pathetic "good against evil" mentality - it does not leave a doubt that only a dead German is a good German. Tom Hanks and the folks gathering around him may do a good job, but still cannot avoid the old cliché: Captain Miller's colorful troop is not much more than the regular bunch of war movie stereotypes who mutate to heroes. Where the Vietnam movies of a Oliver Stone (Platoon) or of a Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket) mercilessly condemn, do Spielberg's shocking pictures justify all committed atrocities in retrospect. Therefore this movie is rather a tribute to the US World War Veterans, than an anti-war movie. An absolution, which illustrates the horrors of war but not its senselessness. All in all, this is a movie we did not need and we could have done very well without it.</fullReview>

Is this the groundbreaking film that everyone was gushing over last year? From all the talk I expected a head-on assault at the beginning of the movie. What I did see was a heavy-handed and frankly uninteresting battle scene. From there the movie only got worse. I didn't care a bit for any of the characters, least of all the Tom Hanks lead and the obnoxious Matt Damon. While the film looked spectacular, that's all it was: surface. There was no depth whatsoever to any of the characters or situations. I feel like maybe there is something wrong with me that I don't see what all the orgasmic gushing over this film is about.

The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.............................................,..............from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLNumbing shock?on a cellular level?motivated me to return to the theater a week later, to experience it again. I was not in the least disappointed. Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions! In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2? hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence. RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#33-IMDb Top 250 today), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only "shades of gray" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of on screen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed "Steamboat Willie"?Just watch, eventually you will understand! Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise Chamian?If the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel bad?she did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian!(Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of America?but RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion) The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever! To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre label?This is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see! To those of you who have seen it once or twice, but who haven't in years?.Please give it another look?You won't be disappointed in the least?RYAN only gets better with each viewing! 10*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!</fullReview>

Captain Miller's platoon has landed on Normandy beach, and has now been assigned to a rescue mission. To locate and save Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) a US paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action. As the group goes through France to find one man, they ask themselves why one man should be as important as the eight looking for him. As I've already stated the battle scenes are amazing.

		<shortDescription>An undisputed classic of the war genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It'd be implausible to think that anyone who wasn't involved in World War 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time. Over the years we've had countless documentaries, novels, movies, games and TV series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the World War that claimed millions upon millions of lives, and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is Steven Spielberg's incredible Saving Private Ryan.A film unlike anything Spielberg had made before or has made since, Ryan, with it's as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of Normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of Ramelle, is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt power.Spielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of film-making wizards. Employing the services of now famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the screen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at its disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.All around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was led by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man Captain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's religiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's gruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's jittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt Damon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of Bryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and even a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.Filled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.A deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the greatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.5 greased up socks out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece and one of Spielberg's finest Movies, the Battle scenes, performances and the film keeping true to World War 2 makes this a brilliant but tough watch. Here's why.The story is good but could've been better, it follows a bunch of soldiers who lands on Normandy, France and successfully defeating the Germans on their first encounter, they must track Down a Survivor of the Normandy incident that happened earlier before they arrived by the chief of the army, so Captain Miller and his soldiers must get Private James Ryan, the Survivor back home and end the war in Normandy and World War 2 itself.The film's ending is something i have to mention, it's so emotional and one of the most best bad endings of all time, where Captain Miller does Deus Ex Machina on an upcoming tank and somehow saves his teammates but he himself dies, and in present time, James Francis Ryan goes to his funeral and also tells his wife to say he is a good man, for all his work during World War 2, it's sad but impressive overall.The Battle scenes are impressive, With some of the most realistic depictions of war ever put into film, each Battle scene is at least 10 minutes which adds to the overall excitement of the film's slow pacing. The film's performances are stunning especially Tom Hanks, all has their own emotion which makes each character interesting and refreshing.The film's direction is as great as previous Spielberg films, here it's all done in a serious matter, where World War 2 is pretty accurate in this Movie than it is in real life. The orchestral is impressive, John Williams is always the king of orchestral Music. The Deaths are pretty emotional, and even myself feel sorry for all of the teammates dying despite the characters being fictional and i still had a hard time seeing these likable characters die.Saving Private Ryan is a benchmark for film Entertainment and it is one of my favourites to this day. Direction, characters, performances, Music, realism, World War 2 accuracy, ending and the overall emotion to the Death scenes makes this a must-watch for anyone willing to watch a great War flick. The only weakness of this Movie is the plot, it's simple and has to have more focus on some of it's locations like Ohama Beach and that it is kinda flat in the middle part of the Movie, other than this minor nitpick, check this Movie out.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great war movie. read review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film ReviewDo you want to watch an excellent dramatic action movie? Then you need to watch Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is magnificent as it provides such realism and such a serious tone throughout the entire film. The movie starts with a reenactment of D-Day, the horrific WWII invasion of Omaha Beach, Normandy in which our country came out victorious in, and shows how truly brutal it really was. As the soldiers progress further onto the beach that they soon take over, a group who is led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), assembles as they receive another mission. This new mission is to search and rescue Private James Ryan who is apart of a paratrooper platoon that landed in an enemy zone just out of contact. As they are proceeding on this search and rescue mission, they come across numerous issues and initiate a few fire fights along the way. As always, a few of the fellow soldiers die as they come closer to reaching their target and things begin to get more and more out of hand. As they come upon their target, they once again face incredible forces and have to defend themselves until backup arrives. As it comes to an end, they become victorious and control the area they fought for but are faced with a very dramatic outcome. This film really gives you the idea of how intense war really is and just how accurate the outcomes would be like.What's so wonderful about the accuracy of this movie is that it is based on the true events of the Normandy invasion of WWII and shows how gruesome it really was. The landscaping of the beach along with the architectural structures it has prepared was almost ideal to the actual beaches layout. When they go through the movie, scenes where they come across enemy platoons, the way they go about surrendering or killing is very accurate. Whereas some films break out into some huge fake fire fight and start all over. The movie is precise on keeping you intrigued and keeping the tone serious so you will keep watching.Keeping the tone serious keeps the movie going. All the characters in the movie are extremely serious and the language they use show it. It is a war movie so you expect the language and actions to be aggressive and serious and that's exactly what you get. The actions are flawless and the way they go about things, such as the death of fellow soldiers is great. They don't break out and make it a big deal, they put dirt in a can with the name of the dead soldier on it and go about the mission. They went about death very well and stuck together as a unit and kept it very realistic.The realism is what keeps this movie alive. The action is so intense, the gun battles are incredible, and the sound effects are just phenomenal and bass dropping. The sounds of the different weaponry are so realistic tying into the accuracy and acting of the film. The gore and blood of some battles may be disturbing to certain viewers because it's so brutal and gruesome.Overall, I would recommend the movie Private Ryan, for all movie lovers. The accuracy of the actual events that transpired on Omaha Beach were historical. The seriousness of the actors portraying the soldiers in my opinion, is done with respect and honor. Honor to all the soldiers who lost their lives that day defending our country. As you are watching the battle scenes the realism in the acting, sound effects, and special effects, makes you feel like you could be right there on the battlefield with the soldiers. Again, if you're in the mood for a good war movie based on actual events, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too formulaic in its depiction of the horrors of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout film history, there's been a constant fascination with war. As new documentaries on the two great World Wars appear every year, so do films on similar events. From All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) to the recently released Fury (2014), Hollywood's interest in depicting war shows no signs of slowing down. Spielberg's 1998 epic Saving Private Ryan fits in a long line of war epics attempting to depict the horrors of war in a realistic manner. SPR does this exceptionally well?for the duration of roughly 20 minutes.The film starts with an old man visiting the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family. He stops at a specific gravestone and collapses in tears. The camera focuses on his eyes and the film flashes back to D-Day with a depiction of the Omaha Beach landing that has to be seen to be believed. This prolonged sequence is the film's and Spielberg's crowning achievement. After the allied forces break through, the film cuts back to events on American soil. At the War Department of the United States it becomes apparent that three of four sons of the Ryan family have been killed. The mother is about to receive this tragic news in the form of three letters being sent simultaneously. A General has this brought to his attention and ? remembering how Abraham Lincoln offered his heartfelt condolences to a mother in similar circumstances ? orders his officers to find the remaining son (Matt Damon), who's somewhere in Normandy, and bring him home. Enter Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) who, having just survived the beach landing, is given the mission, gathers a small group of soldiers and ? with some reservations about the importance of the mission when juxtaposed with the big picture ? they all head further into Normandy in search of a single soldier.The extensive Omaha Beach sequence is the single reason why anyone's still talking about this film. The amount of planning required for this scene must have been incredible and yet the entire scene still feels 'unplanned' and appropriately chaotic. It wouldn't be a stretch to name this sequence the reason the film's been showered with Academy Awards. Other aspects like acting and especially the cinematography and production design are also praiseworthy, but that's pretty much where it ends for me.I find the rest of the film to be something of a mixed bag. It chronicles Miller and co's search for Private Ryan and all the hardships they endure along the way. The main problem I have with the rest of the film is that it feels contrived. The Omaha Beach sequence is at once the film's saving grace and the reason the rest of the film pales by comparison. Not that the rest of the film has nothing to offer dramatically, it does, but it all feels too calculated, too contrived and convenient as opposed to the radical and chaotic opening scene. For instance, you expect the soldiers to bond over the course of their journey before some of them die and how this is all supposed to elicit our sympathy. You see this coming long before it happens and it's thus not as impactful as it should be. And what about the oh-so dramatic pause right before the sniper in the tower is shot by a tank's cannon, designed so that we can symbolically say goodbye; Miller's clichéd reference to his wife gardening with his gloves (all that's missing are the images of white-picket fences); Ryan's two-minute monologue ? supposed to elicit our sympathy ? which comes across as incredibly awkward; the fact that Miller is shot by the same German whom he showed mercy to several scenes ago and that it's the bookish Upham (of all people) who 'earns his stripes' by conveniently killing him; old Ryan saluting Miller's grave while trumpets hum patriotically in the background; the fact that the filmmakers did the oh-so (for lack of a better word) 'American' thing by bookending the film with shots of the American flag softly lit by the afternoon sun, etc, etc. All these scenes and more reveal a script purposefully crafted to the point of dramatic perfection?and that's not a compliment. Why does the Omaha Beach sequence still amaze after all these years? Because it represents the horrors of war in purely visual terms. There is no dramatic logic, only chaos; bodies and limbs flying everywhere, soldiers whimpering and screaming. There are no allied soldiers and Nazis, just people trying to survive. The rest of the film with all its carefully calculated drama doesn't come within a country mile of effectively conveying the same sense of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed this war movie for the most part, but after the initial invasion of Normandy scene it falters a bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was like no other the first twenty or so minutes. It took you right into the heart of war like no other movie had done before. The action was tense, the carnage was in your face, and the blood flowed freely. Then the movie added a rather sad excuse for a plot and the rest of the movie suffers because of this. Not to say it was not a good movie from the moment they get the plot on, but it just feels cheapened by the whole, "lets rescue this one dude" scenario. Most of the rest of the film is the troops searching from place to place with a few skirmishes here and there. An interesting subplot though involves one of the American soldiers calling for the release of a Nazi that the rest wanted to kill. I found how that played out to be very intriguing. It made for one of the tenses scenes in the movie in my eyes as the one guy was trying to drive the knife in another and you just knew the other guy was going to come in and turn the tide. The cast is excellent as Tom Hanks is at his best here, I can believe he did not get an Oscar for this one and he did get one for "Forrest Gump". The only member of the cast I did not care for all that much is Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan, he just did not have a 1940's look to him, or like someone who had been in combat for a while like Hanks' troop. Still, overall this is a very good picture and while I never saw "Shakespere in Love" I am still certain this film got robbed. Granted my score is not the best, but that is my level of enjoyment for the film. As a whole it most certainly merited some awards. Change the plot a bit though after the invasion scene and I think this one could have even been a ten to me, a person who really is not all into war movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just reading the public comments on Saving Private Ryan on this sight made tears come to my eyes. This movie captured my respect as a history lover in that it gave you just what is to be expected during an amphibious landing in WWII. Saving Private Ryan held no punches on war being ugly, sicking and horrific. The only thing that was missing was the smell of battle. The audio visual aspect was, it seems to me, beyond perfect that I was really there on D-Day extremely scared while trying to get off the beach. I recommend this movie to be seen by every U.S. president, senator, representative before taking office. I was told that this war epic was so influential it made potential cadets who viewed it, turn down their West Point appointments. Even thinking about this production will cause emotions to get the best of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think What You May But Please Don't Miss THE Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really does not matter what one thinks of this film as long as they catch the underlying message. Anyone who has been involved in combat or survived a catastrophe can relate to it. Having no psychological training, I refer to it as the 'Why Me' syndrome. The first and last 5 minutes along with one line towards the end of the movie depict the message's fullest impact on a person relate to it. Having been in NYC when the World Trade Center was hit, I do not doubt many who survived that catastrophe have similar feelings. What is it? It is the guilt, the sense of embarrassment, the confusion, the internal turmoil and the many unanswered questions associated with surviving such an event when so many you consider better or more deserving than you did not. Private Ryan in his later years experiences this in its fullest during the first and last five minutes of the movie. Tom Hanks dying words 'Earn this.' were said for those who never experienced such events. Those who have do not have to be reminded. There are a great many other messages that the uninitiated could pick up.If you ever wondered why your father, grandfather husband or more recently wife are the way they are or 'changed' after such an experience this is most likely why. When the World War II vets came home they were heroes. When the Korean War vets came home they came home. When the Vietnam vets came home? However, although how they were treated after they came home had an impact on their psyche, what they experienced while they were 'there' left an indelible mark they will never be able to erase. These experiences come to mind while daydreaming, they hit you like a punch when they pop into your mind when concentrating on something totally unrelated and regardless of how long ago it happened one can not control their dreams. All I ask is that regardless of what you think of our involvement in Iraq, those who were there did not make our foreign policy. Believe me, if they had their choice virtually all of them would have rather been somewhere else. Just try to remember what they have been through and that they will relive those experiences for the rest of their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was one thing that allowed the Nazis to almost take over the world, it was there revolutionary tank strategy - masses of tanks working in perfect co-ordination. In this film, single Panzer tanks just go wandering around the countryside at will, till they bump in to something.This film is formulaic in extremis - every scene you've seen before, only better. You know the scene from a hundred films where a character is in the thick of tumultuous action, then ducks under water and it all goes silent, repeated 3-4 times? Well yes, that's here, only when the guy pops up all we get is a few popping and spluttering machine guns. The sound throughout this film is the worst ever in any war movie. Even the crumbiest soap operas today have the background hum in group scenes, bars, etc. Not here, you mostly just here the character in focus, the troop of soldiers standing around are silent. The claim to reality made by some must be down to ten dollars worth of offal spread around the bodies.Even dialogue is without any conviction - people did use the f-word then of course but not in the repetitive way which has become the fashion now. In fact, the french referred to GIs as 'La Beetch' after the phrase which all GIs used all day long - "Son of a bitch". I didn't hear that used once in the whole film.It is sad that such a ridiculously unrealistic and unbelievable film should be given so much ill-deserved credit. I would recommend "Cross of Iron", "The Victors" or "The Train" instead</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that those that are critical of SPR, they are all hypercritical for their own personal reasons. Let's back up and look at this movie as a film- because that's all that it is, a film. For those of you that see a representation of the Americans as the good ol' boys and the Germans as the bad guys, let's remember the scenes where the Germans were brutally shot at point blank range with their hands in the air to surrender. Anyone who misses the point that the Germans were just as human as the Americans were, misses the point all together as I see it.I don't see where Spielberg makes them look any better or worse than we or any other soldier was in the war.As far as steering from the truth, anyone that has followed ANY historical movie knows that there are certain artistic licenses taken to embellish the depiction. If historic films were depicted one hundred percent as they actually happened they would ALL fall under the documentary category. This is NOT a documentary and shouldn't be judged as such.I purposely don't/haven't watched war films because I abhor violence and the use of violence as an ends to ANY means. However I saw this film because I had heard that it is one of the best representations of what happened on Omaha Beach and the tragedies of war. Never had I been so moved and truly felt how horrible it must have been to be there or in any war.It is a film, and just that, a film. An interpretation by Spielberg of what happened. Be critical of what the film meant to you and how you feel, not of what was in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think about the meaning of the second scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Saving Private Ryan with high hopes. As someone who has followed Spielberg's career since Jaws, I knew I would be put through the gamut of emotional responses during the movie.What I wasn't prepared for was the second scene. I sat quietly through the recreation of the landing at Normandy, through the endless body parts being pitched into the air. I was horrified at the sight of the armless soldier searching for his severed limb, the men trying to get out of the water before they drowned only to be cut down by bullets before they could. I felt the tears well up in my eyes at the sights of these brave men, some of whom could have been my older uncles (my family fought there), giving their lives so that all of us could be free.Watching the screen fade from the shot of the dead soldier, sorrounded by dead fish in a red-hued sea change to the office of the war department. Dozens of women typing letters to the families of those lost on the battlefield. The tears didn't stop, they came on full force. Luckily, my family was spared the horror of one of those letters, the visits by high -ranking men in uniforms coming to tell mothers and wives that their men wouldn't be coming back. But, I felt for them. All the battles, all the training, all the pride of having a family member fighting to keep the world free of evil meant nothing more than a letter home typed by a faceless secretary and passed along for signing. Not that I'm putting down what these women did for the war effort. They had their jobs to do as well. It just touched me to no end to see this. One minute a soldier is a brave man, fighting for his country and freedom, the next he is nothing more than a letter and a folded flag.I hope everybody, who sees this film, doubles their efforts in making sure we as a species NEVER have to do that again. Show this to future generations, along with Schindler's List, make them aware that the war did happen, that this kind of evil is possible. We have had too many Rambos. It's time we looked at the war the way it was; brutal, cruel and took the lives of too many men before they had the chance to live their lives.My hat is off to Mr. Spielberg once again. Don't let us forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earn this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reading through the comments made on this page, I realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be (as people often do). However, here's how I feel the movie was intended, and why I say that this is by far the greatest war movie, and one of the greatest movies of any genre. The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable. That's exactly what Spielberg wanted. First, the characters. They were _intended_ to be stereotypical. How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical? Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people. The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.Second, the plot. The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man. He wasn't. He was everyone. Every person that was sitting in that theater. Every person that has ever been a part of this country. When he tells Ryan to "Earn this", he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident. It took normal men (a school-teacher, for instance) to make sure that we could someday go on IMDB after seeing a movie and spout our opinions. He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given. So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not. And they fought so that I could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion. Thank God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: 4,413 men recorded dead in what is known as the turning point of World War 2, the day of days, D-day.... Until Saving Private Ryan there has not been a film that has come close to showing an entire audience through a cinema screen just how tragic, terrifying and real this war was. Saving Private Ryan is story about a group of eight men led by Captain Miller (Tom hanks) who have been assigned to bring one man home to his mother. A mother who has lost three of her sons due to this war, and to lose a forth is inconceivable. A story of courage, bravery, friendship, brother hood and belief there is hope for humanity where all hope is lost. Until Saving Private Ryan there have been countless film adaptions of World war 2, but few have attempted to bring the harsh reality of war home to the viewing audience, and make you feel as if you are there. Well, Spielberg has certainly achieved this. For the first 27 minutes of the film, we witness one of cinemas most historical openings to a film, but also one of histories most tragic and important moments - D-day. You find yourself stunned into silence once the landing crafts door spins open, as instantly you see young men mowed down by German mounted machine guns, the sound of land mines, mortar fire and screaming all adds to this horrific moment. Ignorantly you find yourself questioning, and wondering why people are drowning? not running? and not firing back? But then you remember you are sat in a cinema or at home and will never experience the shear fear and loss of humanity in moments like that.Like all directors, Spielberg is certainly not perfect, and there are moments throughout this film that 'lack' information, and are in some respect "Hollywood" such as we only witness the Americans running up Omaha beach (but never hear about Juno, Sword, Gold, Utah), and granted the majority of the soldiers storming Omaha were Americans, but where are the rest of the Allies who assisted in the Omaha landing (after all U.S.A won the war didn't they?). Regardless of some minor factual eras, this opening is none the less a cinematic master piece (which won him the Oscar for Best Director). Steven Spielberg not only aimed to show the needless, countless and horrific violence of this war, he also has tried to show us as an audience that in these dark times, humanity will find a way, and that is the basis of our story (although a fictional story, it is a heart felt and beautiful story, that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout). Saving Private Ryan is a film that has been noted, and criticised as being needlessly violent, bloody and chaotic. You cannot argue that violence, blood and chaos are entirely apparent from the get go, but you certainly cannot say it is needless. Spielberg has masterfully encapsulated a time in history where everything that was 'right', was most definitely not. Cpt Miller, played by Tom Hanks, who in an Oscar nominated performance (which lets face it, you wouldn't expect any less) will embark on the mission of finding Private James Ryan (Iowa) the fourth brother, to bring him home to his grieving mother. Tom hanks is accompanied by an all star cast of seven men: Sargent Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). If this cast alone isn't an incentive to see the film, the story of their journey for humanity, justice and to risk eight lives to save one will have you by the throat throughout. As far as war films go, I can honestly say there has never been one so close to the bone that you are left speechless, and feel as if you are a witness to something you have only ever read or heard about. Each characters struggle for survival and to simply make it back home will remind you how lucky you are, but find also make you feel like you are part of this mission. One of the most powerful moments in this film, comes early on when the head of the US Army hears about the mothers loss, and decides it is right to bring the fourth brother home. Spielberg has included a letter Abraham Lincoln once wrote to a "Mrs Bixby, in Boston" during America's most tragic of wars, the Civil War. Although a letter written years before World War 2, it is written by one of Americas most iconic and notable presidents who's vocabulary and inspirational writing is still ever apparent today. The letter gives us a sense that somewhere in the mist of all war and unspeakable violence it is the families of these young men and women who are giving their lives that really matters. "Executive Mansion, Washington, Nov. 21, 1864. Dear Madam,-- I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,A. Lincoln"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the invasions on Omaha Beach (D-Day), to the final battle in Ramelle, this movie was as action packed and graphic as possible. Anytime Spielberg and Hanks team up, it's pure gold. Especially this time. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire duration of this movie. If you're a war movie fan, I guarantee you that this will make the top of your list. This is as real as war can get on a TV screen. War movies completely changed after this film was released in 1998. It has influenced the film industry as much as any other movie out there. In my opinion, this is Spielberg's best work ever, as well as Hanks. There are so many realistic parts of this movie, it's insane. After all, it is based on a true story. People said that the D-Day scene was so accurate, it might as well had been real. When it comes down to it, this film is one of the most iconic films ever, and arguably the best war movie ever created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but has some definite flaws. Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the framing device for the movie is not just sappy but downright manipulative and quite frankly impossible. Anytime you frame a flashback like that, you have to stay (mostly) within that characters frame of reference (I can't think of a single example that stays 100% in first person--it's just not possible or practical). How can Ryan look back in time on someone else's life, while he's somewhere else? I certainly doubt that Hanks could have told him his life story so quickly. Spielberg's no idiot, so he knows that this isn't possible, which brings us back to the manipulation factor and the chance to have a "surprise ending" in the worst possible sense. I'd like to think Spielberg was trying to emulate the experience of war (and not knowing who's going to live or who's going to die) by making the old cliches of war movies (that the hero will live) work for him. Because Spielberg makes us believe that Hanks' character isn't going to die (we think he's the old man), then supposedly we'll be more shocked and have more emotions when he is killed, as if we were experiencing war in real-time. For me this didn't work, because by Bull-S*** alarm started blaring. It has a high intolerance for lies, and that is pretty much what the framing device does. It promises one thing, but gives just the opposite.If Spielberg had not included the framing device, I would have given the movie a 9/10 instead of 7/10. Why he felt he needed one, I don't know, since, even beyond my other complaints, the framing device doesn't add anything to the movie that couldn't have been done (and better) while we were still in 1945.By the way, did they bury all of our dead in France in that graveyard? I thought that one was for those who died on the beach that first day (but I'm not sure). Hanks was pretty far in by the time he died.One final point: the "evil", backstabbing German captive thing worked all right as propaganda (and even better as a lesson in mob violence) back when Hitchcock directed his extraordinary Lifeboat in 1944(?), but when stolen and put in Private Ryan, it just seemed like a plot device--he would just as likely have been grateful for being spared. Or, as a hypothetical situation in which Germany invaded America, it is just as likely that an American would do exactly the same thing as the German. At least in Lifeboat, the issue is thoroughly explored, while Private Ryan uses it merely to show how the weak-willed, peace-loving, prototype-hippie linguist learns that killing people in war is necessary. Whatever happened to the less pro-active attitude from Catch-22?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliché, but every main character is fully fleshed out.This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a hand-held style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, "Tu es partout" before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film gives you everything you could want in war film. Well choreographed battle sequences and some real human emotion. Everybody who has seen at least the first 10 minutes of this film then you know it deserved some kind of award just for that great depiction of the battle on Omaha beach. Sure there's still 2 hours and 30 minutes left after that but it only makes the film better. After the battle tom hanks and several men are assigned to a mission to retrieve Private Ryan un harmed and return him home due to his two other brothers being killed leaving him the last son alive. So now there is a good story for a war film and plenty of movie left for various battles, subplots, and all sorts of things.The film even without the battle sequences would probably still work thanks to the great emotional and raw scenes but it just wouldn't be a 10. This as you already know is definitely a film everybody needs to check out at one point, your response to the film might be completely different from mine so you make a review and express your opinion you've acquired from watching the film.

		<shortDescription>Great Realistic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the name suggests this a war-movie in which an agent named Capt. Miller(Tom Hanks) is sent on a mission to save a soldier named Pvt. James Ryan. Ryan's mother has already lost her three children in the same war against the Germans. Movie starts with an approx. 25 minutes of a thriller action sequence where the American forces are fighting against German forces at Omaha Beach. Director Steven Spielberg has made this scene one of the most epic real war sequence I have ever seen in a movie. Thousands of soldiers died in this horrifying, dreadful sequence. Special effects by cinematographer(Janusz Kaminski, also in Schindler's list) has made this a perfect sequence. Protagonist Capt Miller survived this war, assembles a group of soldiers to invade German troops and find Ryan. Movie depicts the struggle of Miller and his team to complete their mission. Movie becomes a little bit slow during the mission but still must be able to hold the audience together.Intense emotion scenes, like when Ryan's mother is informed about the tragic death of her three sons might make viewers cry and arouse patriotic feeling in them. Movie showcase some good strategies, teamwork, breakdowns and courage. All these things together complete this movie and makes it much more interesting than any other fiction movie.Tom Hanks's acting has raised the bar of expectations further high. Steven Spielberg has done one of the greatest job you will ever see. Realism in this movie makes it a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true classic. And honestly my favorite Spielberg and movie of all time.STORYLINE: The storyline starts during Omaha Beach. Were we somewhat meet are hero's. Around 30 minutes in the actual story comes into play. Private James Ryan's (Matt Damon) 3 brothers are all killed in the line of duty. So Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and all of his crew are set to find him and bring him back home.CHARACTERS AND ACTING: The movie itself is powerful. The characters are smartly written. Because they question the mission. Why would 8 guys go over and save 1 man? Tom Hanks is as powerful as he ever is. He portrays his character of a man who has suffered during times of war. And his "That's my mission" speech always moved me. In short everyone does a great job.OTHER: This movie is powerful. And after watching it you want to take a shower and sing "The Star Spangled Banner" Because it is patriotic and it makes you feel proud. And of course the first 25 minutes of the movie is so incredibly well done that it makes shaky-cam look like a masterpiece! And this film is a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Stephen E. Ambrose's book, 'Band of Brothers,' written in 1992. In Chapter Six, 'Move Out,' Fritz Niland -- a member of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army, lost his brother Bob Niland, who was killed on D-Day. A second brother had been killed on Utah Beach on D-Day. And a third brother was killed, a pilot in the China-Burma-India theater that same week. His mother received all three telegrams on the same day. However, in "real life" Fritz was never lost, was immediately located by a Father Sampson, escorted to Utah Beach, and was flown to London, and then back to the States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, despite simplified characterizatins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of three years ago, I have made a point of watching this film on June 6th every year, so that the true meaning of this historic date will never be lost. I know it sounds trite, but with holidays such as Memorial Day quickly becoming an excuse for cookouts, I feel the need to reinforce the terrible and awesome sacrifices that have shaped the course of history. This movie does just that. For all of it's character development shortcomings, it still ranks as simply the most powerful cinematic depiction of war I have ever seen. And as a side note, the whole character development issue almost seems moot, considering the context in which most of these men knew each other. Ready to die for their brothers, many ironically knew very little of each other's personal lives, except for snippets learned during the calm interludes, when the soldier would share stories or letters from a world far away. That is why the betting on what Hank's character does as a civilian makes so much sense. To many, life at home was a carefully guarded treasure that served as a very personal and private link to sanity and hope. If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to do so. You will find a whole new appreciation for the ability of the common man who, faced with impossible odds and true terror, is somehow able to accomplish the extroardinary. It will renew your faith in mankind, while simultaneously horrifying you at man's folly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being still a teenager, I realize that I am still relatively young and may not fully comprehend the true impact of war, if ever. I know that many have criticized this movie for not truly giving the sense of war or whatnot.In my view, this was not the purpose of the movie. Instead, I believe that this movie was made as a tribute for those lives lost in the war and to give the audience a more graphic taste of the battlefield. The viewer may only begin to get a sense of the horror felt by those involved, but I hope that most will never have to know such feelings.Movie-wise, its terrific. Superb acting, exciting and twisting plot, emotional moments, and edge-of-your-seat action. I came away speechless with a better view of the true loss of war.While the feelings conveyed are not as realistic as some would like, this movie is also not exactly a light-hearted take on war. I feel that Hollywood has a responsibility to accurately reproduce the historical subject being represented to the best of their ability, and this is achieved. The costumes, special effects, sounds, and sets are virtually genuine.The bottom line: While unable to truly portray the experience of war, the viewer still comes away feeling solemn and respectful with a true sense of loss for those involved. The excellent production values are only a bonus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Great and Overrated, at the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three brothers in the Ryan family, who have enlisted to fight in the US military in WWII, have been killed in various theaters of war. As the military prepares to notify the mother of the deaths of her three sons, they discover that there's a fourth brother - Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). A group of soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to Northern Europe to find him, if he is still alive, and send him home. The film follows there long, hard trek to find this man, and then get him out.This is a great film, like many of Spielberg's are, but I have to say, it is a bit overrated. There are many great war films, and I wouldn't quite but this one in the top five. Definetly the top ten, better than most war films, but not quite the top five.The action scenes are groundbreaking; this was a first in what was considered acceptable in cinema. Spielberg only focuses on this, though. We see what the troops go through physically, but not mentally; every now and then, we get some strained expressions on their faces, but Spielberg never uses his proven film making skills to put you in these guys shoes, to let you know what they're thinking.Consequently, we only get half the story. How can I put this in the top ten, then? Because the other half is just done so well. There are also good performances here - this is the only time I liked Vin Diesel. Remember, i'm not knocking this film - I put it in the top ten best war films ever made. Definetly a classic. I just think it's stretching it when people rave that this is the best war film ever. Don't let this fool you - buy a copy of this on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great battle scenes in an otherwise average movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe my summary line was a bit harsh. Saving Private Ryan is not an average movie, but I don't think it's as great as the rest of the world seems to think. Yes the various battle scenes are gut-wrenching, but the movie overall was slightly disappointing.Firstly, the film is completely US-centric. I think one non-American character (a German soldier who is begging for his life at the time) gets a speaking role in the film. There is no indication that soldiers from other countries took part in the D-day landings. The American soldiers die horribly, tragically, heroically, dramatically. The German soldiers just die. Bang, grunt, thud: another dead German.We see all of the tension and fear experienced by the Americans, yet none of that which must have been felt by the opposing Germans. They were, after all, one and the same, merely servants of opposing political masters. Yet the movie completely misses the chance to humanise the enemy, to show that they too are just ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.Saving Private Ryan is, in short, a Hollywood blockbuster, with gory battle bits. The American soldiers are the human good guys, the German soldiers are the inhuman bad guys, war is Hell, but we're better at it than you.I didn't *hate* this movie, I just didn't think it was worth all of the plaudits which it has received. Tom Hanks is, of course, always watchable, the story rolls along nicely, the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat (or possibly under it), and the anti-war grittiness does outweigh the pro-American good vs. bad slant. For the record, I thought the spin-off TV series Band of Brothers was marginally better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a couple of things :first of all I would like to say that "History is written by winners", please think about that. Hollywood productions don't give any objective account of WW2.Regarding "Saving Private Ryan" : at the beginning of the movie 2 hundred *poor* Americans are ruthlessly slaughtered by a punch of faceless "Huns" who are defending the beach. At the end of the movie an *heroic* punch of Americans are defending a bridge by killing 2 hundred SS and by destroying 2 Tiger tanks with sticky bombs (!) and hand-thrown mortar ammunitions (!!).In both cases Germans are dumb and on the wrong side, either as killers or as victims!It is my opinion that soldiers of both armies were equally forced to fight by orders from above and inspired by boastful belief. There is nothing really heroic in war.If you want to find a more believable perspective of operation Overlord try Max Hasting's book "Overlord" (1984). You'll learn much more about the poor performance of American infantry and "evil" Germans' fighting prowess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless characters die in battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film may have been more than well-done gore-fest if any of the characters had been remotely interesting, I may have cared whether or not their lives were worth risking. Their mission didn't seem any riskier than anything else they may have encountered. There was no dramatic conflict. The character-developing monologues were nauseating and the stories they told were recycled workshop material. The true story upon which the film was based was totally undermined, and Spielberg's point of view is uncommitted, self-involved, and pedestrian. He quotes Abraham Lincoln instead of exploring the issues, and asks for approval at the end. Frankly, the emptiness of the story, characters, and treatment wasn't worth the pain of the opening scene.</fullReview>

I can't wait for my son to be old enough to sit and watch it with me :) I don't think any other movie about war would even come close to Saving Private Ryan. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were a good pair, and would be good to pair up again! I recommend this movie to A LOT of my friends. They come back and tell me that it was remarkable, then they tell other people to watch it. I wish that I could shake Spielberg's hand to say Thank You for making an AWESOME movie and that I'm going to wear out my disc very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent combat scenes - unrealistic dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could view this movie like the average moviegoer. In that case, I would probably have given it higher marks. However, I was in the Army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely, no, impossible, to have been said in real life.The hierarchy in the service is very clear: privates do not contradict, interrupt, defy, or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film. I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy. The scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he is searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with Matt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believe.The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against shooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some of the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45 caliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate. The scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his .45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle. The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also didn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome weapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short volley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest of the GIs after that.The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs curse up a storm. These guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome. Platoon gave a much more accurate account of how GIs actually behave.These criticisms aside, the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1940's War Movie Without the Hays Code Restrictions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw "Saving Private Ryan" as a family. My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly to the extent that I walk by teasing him that I'll let him know the end - "The Germans lose!", thought it was a fresh spin on traditional war movies by showing the doubts of the soldiers. I thought it was just a color WWII movie as young 'uns refuse to see black and white movies these days. I could match that this actor was playing the William Bendix role, this one John Garfield's, this one Robert Ryan's, this one Montgomery Clift, etc.Those movies were restricted by the Hays Code and the need to spur war time spirit that they couldn't show doubts, though I remember some revisionist movies made after about the impact on Berlin, another with Robert Taylor vs. the Japanese on some island. Or even Bridge on the River Kwai. So they weren't all jingoistic.I walked out of "Ryan" saying "Gee, war is hell." Edward Burns was excellent.The cinematography was terrific and compelling.

		<fullReview>The beach scenes are absolutely fantastic, and I'm not sure if I did breathe at all during those sequences. The sound and the effects are amazing, the use of small hand cams gave the whole thing a documentary feeling of the hell that met the men who landed on the beach. Sadly after that it is not too good, and the film quickly becomes a standard Hollywood WW2 film, with heroic Americans and stupid German soldiers. A better story and less sentimentality (everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director. The price for freedom is high)would have given this film a 10/10. I think the men who laid down their lives on the beaches in the fight to free Europe deserves more than this.</fullReview>

As Oliver Stone recognises in Platoon, soldiers fight for one another not a great cause. As the Platoon Sergeant says in Hamburger Hill regarding the death of one of the men: 'He died taking out that automatic weapon for you and third squad - and don't you give him anything less.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Righteous, Embellishing, and slightly Jingoistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that opens with a lengthy shot of the American flag has got problems.In general, I thought it superficial, poorly written and poorly directed. Spielberg has a penchant for thrusting his movies upon his viewers, spoon -feeding them morality in doses of banal righteousness. I personally don't go to the movies to be treated like a schoolkid and taught a lesson so elementary, vague, and though ultimately true, trite.Those who see Saving Private Ryan as a revelatory view of war obviously slept through High School History. War is gruesome, war isn't fun, war sucks. Glad to see the truth Spielberg, but dizzying freehand camera shots, pointless music (the music sucked throughout), and timed successions of loud booms gave me more of a headache than visceral enlightenment. About 5 minutes into the D-Day scene, when the cacophony of camera shots and dead bodies reached its apogee, I asked myself: "Why did Spielberg put this in? Did he have any real reason except to embellish the gruesomeness of war? Does this really contribute to the movie?" I found the answer to be no.Then there's the plot and characters ... wait, what plot and characters? Here are 8(?) men meandering through French territory wondering why they are all such damn stereotypical and superficial characters. There's the bookworm, the Italian, the Southerner, the Jew, etc. In the end I can't feel very much for any of these characters cause they're not even human to me; they're typecasts. Even Tom Hanks (who does a worthy job), remains distant and emotionally inaccessible (due to poor writing). (So we know that his hand shakes and he teaches English. BFD) Spielberg could take a lesson from, say, John Sayles, about character development.Then there's the plot. From the title, I expected there to be more focus on Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the group wanders through Normandy and the hunt for Ryan becomes unimportant and adventitious. The movie's impetus is seriously lacking, and I accredit this to poor directorial focus. Spielberg had problems finding a point to direct the energy of the war to, and instead directed it towards some vague moral standard. Unlike, say, Apocalypse Now, where the search for Brando has a singular focus on him, the soldiers wander aimlessly and haphazardly stumble upon Ryan in the most obtuse and anticlimatic fashion possible. On their way they go through a perfectly crafted sine curve of battles and traumas, discoveries and enlighenments. And as soon as I saw Ted Danson I couldn't help but drift to place where everybody knows your name and guys in pasty blue uniforms named Cliff down Heneiekens. Now THAT'S poor focus.In the end I could predict flatly what would happen. Yes, it's a true story, so Spielberg was limited, but the presentation was just too flat. The ending is so utterly pitiful and righteous I wanted to puke. "So, this is what the movie came down to?" I thought as the American flag waved me goodbye. "War is bad. America is good. Death is bad. Life is good. " Drink Bud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all this isn't a bad war flick, its got a good story that flows well and i enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few moments that were dull and slow moving but on the whole it moved well and kept me interested. However the dialogue is not up to scratch in some areas particularly when the band of soldiers first set out to find Ryan, its very banal. A major problem i had with the film (and it is a fairly big one) is the nauseating patriotism that emanates from it. This seems to be a problem with others here as well, it's just irritating and spoils the whole movie for me, it's hard to ignore it because it is felt throughout the movie, in some parts more than in others, especially at the end there where the American planes bomb the German positions and the viewer once again has America to thank for saving the day.

		<shortDescription>A post Viet-Nam Hollywood failure (as a period film)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audio engineering and sound effects are the best of any war picture ever. This is among many valid reasons why SAVING PVT RYAN is a must-see movie. However, do not expect perfection. Do not expect this film will live up to all of the hype.Briefly stated, members of the WWII generation spoke with a formality not captured in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Unlike Hanks et al, Rock Hudson, Jimmy Stewart, Earnest Borgnine, and many old-time actors served in WWII. Even more future writers, directors and Hollywood producers served as well. Their later film efforts accurately captured the feel of the times. The difference is rather striking. Please view any movie or even a TV production created by members of the Greatest Generation and see for yourself how it compares to RYAN. As unlikely as it may seem, one can even hold out "Hogan's Heroes" -- a light TV comedy set during WWII created in the early 60's by men who had experienced WWII -- as a Hollywood production better capturing the essence of WWII era interpersonal communication. The characters in HOGAN naturally and automatically interacted with each other with the yes sir's and no sir's, personal respect and greater formality common in the 1940's. Looking further, any Hollywood film produced in the 40's and 50's captured the essence of the day even better.Where a lightweight TV comedy succeeds, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shockingly fails. Characters in RYAN interact with the casual ease of 1998, and NOT with the formality common in the 1940's. Rather than appearing to be part of the Greatest Generation, the actors in PRIVATE RYAN seem to be following the motivations of modern Hollywood producers who know only today's post Viet-Nam contempt, scorn and cynicism. Speaking of cynicism, the subplot of the General's high class transport plane was completely made up in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN -- made up by a post Viet-Nam Hollywood.</fullReview>

Schultz.This has to be the most over rated film in recent history. The Germans are portrayed so flatly that they may as well have saved money on actors and used cardboard stand-ups. But check out how kind hearted those U.S. soldiers are! They spare the life of an enemy!! They risk a dozen men for the life of one, who may not even be alive!! What?? Are these tears on my keyboard as I type this?This film is one that *appears* to be portraying humanity at it's lowest and highest...but in reality it is a sham, perpetrated by a Spielbergian wizard, pulling his levers behind a curtain of propaganda. At it's best, this movie is a pro-war advertisement masquerading as patriotism for humanity. At it's worst...well, look around, you're soaking in it.I'd refer anyone who is interested to read Howard Zinn's essay in his book "Howard Zinn On War".

Steven Spielberg I would just like to say how believable the first half an hour was with the scenes on the beach. Someone as young as me can only imagine the horrors of what those brave men (that is British, Australian, French, Dutch etc) went through in both World Wars (to me and the trenches of the First would be the most horrific). These behind the scenes men would not care about one person and other men could not be spared to go and find him! I know for a fact they do not as my Great Grandmother had to endure something similar in the First World War! I also wonder if these script writers do any research or care about history?

Steven Spielbergs "Masterpiece" of a war-movie "shows" us how history can be changed just to show German peoples as backstabbing, chicken-hearted and dumb. OK, the war has been lost, GOOD, I'm glad Germany lost that war. But the film does not display the truth. We all know Americans are the best soldiers, best humans, everyday when they wake up thinking about how to save the planet this time because they are the best peoples on this planet. So you see that soldier running to the bunker because he is an American, always ready to risk his own life for Worldpeace. If its the bad Russians, Japanese or Germans, we need to save this planet from them. I have one question. Who will save us from these intolerably Americans ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gruesome, big-budget film from Steven Spielberg, is saved only by its skilful direction. I can honestly say that every single other aspect of this film was d-grade. If you are looking for an excellent modern war film pick up a copy of the SHOCKINGLY UNDERRATED 'The Thin Red Line'. SPR is only famous because of it's highly publicised 'blood letting'. The war scenes are highly graphic and exciting, but it fails to shock us and reveal to us the true horrors of war. It is pretty clear that the writers took about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon in between innings at the cricket to concoct this crap. Tom Hanks, the boring, mainstream Hollywood, 'all American' actor, fails to please in this film (same with every other film he has been in). The rest of the cast are just as bland as Hanks, and fail to give us an interesting interpretation of their already pointless characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confuses Verisimilitude, Authenticity, Documentation, and Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the "realism" of this movie because thecombat scenes are graphic, intense, and more accurate in therange of detail than much of what came before it. But as much wasmade of the "authenticity" of this movie because of the attention todetail made in its preparation. For instance, Spielberg bought upthe last stock of original legging and strap material to make part ofthe uniforms, real M-1 rifles, searched exhaustively for the beachappropriate for shooting that was absolutely closest to theappearance of Normandy in 1944, and so forth.But let's think about that. What's the point of having an "authentic"cartridge belt, except that the audience knows about this from thereviews, planted press stories, etc.? A replica can be made to lookmore like the authentic thing than the authentic thing itself, giventhe aging of the intervening years. But this was a sort of formalisticpost-modern exercise engaged by the filmmakers to convincehimself and the audience, before even seeing the movie, thatwhat they were seeing represented the "truth".&lt;potential spoiler follows&gt;The opening scene of the aged Ryan, walking the graveyards ofNormandy, reflecting on the sacrifice of so many of his comradesjust so he could walk there with his adoring grandkids, is a classicexample of Spielberg heavy-handedness. He has to inject atone-deaf repetition of the 'why we fight' message into thebeginning, end, and middle of this movie to show that it was 'allworth it'. Spielberg, being a literalist, has every character in thesquad pontificate on the subject along the way to locate PrivateRyan.Why? Why do eight guys get themselves killed just to save one?Well, the needs of the one sometimes outweigh the needs of themany. Frankly, Star Trek III made the point somewhat more subtly. Or is it the words put into Tom Hanks' character's mouth, "I'm justfighting for the right to go home to my wife"? There's no elucidationof this point here, just a ham-fisted morphing flashback andflashforward to hammer home the point 'hey, this is connected tothe present' leaving the viewer to connect up the soundbyte dots.I won't go into the many war movie cliches this film engages in.Because Spielberg put together the celebrated first 20 minutes ofthis movie, some of the most stunning combat sequences put onfilm, does not excuse him the rest of the movie's repeated use ofB-movie props and stereotypes. Even the use of "documentary"film techniques in the combat sequences is a bit too precious: it'sreferential to real film of real combat, but hardly 'documentary'.Documentary evidence shows things that happened: this filmuses the technique to try to convince the viewer that a fictive,simplistic interpretation of war, the whys and the whats, is "reality".The verisimilitude of the visuals of the combat sequences doesnot make it "real". Using authentic materials from World War IIdoes not make it "real". At the bottom of this movie is one versionof a fairy tale about war.For that reason I think 'Private Ryan' is a dangerous film, becauseit's become the primary historical education for most people aboutD-Day, World War II, and American participation in the mostcataclysmic event in history to date, and it's about as "true" to thatcomplex history as John Wayne was to the history of the West. Anexciting, hard-hitting action combat sequence that gets theapproval of veterans sixty-years removed from the events as being"like what it was" isn't history. It's constructing a virtual reality thatthreatens to overtake, engulf, swallow, and become history, like apod person in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.I am left mostly wondering what Sam Fuller could've done withSpielberg's budgets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIELBERG SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our veterans of WW2 should definitely be honored. In fact, for what they did, we can never thank them enough. They deserve parades, memorials, and everything else you can name. Unfortunately, Spielberg exploits our veterans.Instead of giving us an honest story, SPR paints our military as father-like and loving. The only true reason why the military would go out on a limb to save a person like Ryan is because if the story of his dead brothers reaches the public and the military manages to rescue the last Ryan brother, they can pat themselves on the shoulder and all the newspapers in the USA will be swayed into making propaganda articles of how loving the military is. In reality, the army views a soldier as nothing more than a tool for winning wars. SPOILER ALERT And why were the German troops not humanized? The Steamboat Willie character was shown as a human at first, but later on he comes back and kills the Jewish soldier in an awfully blatant scene and later on kills Captain Miller. I have news for you people who loved this movie...THE GERMANS WHO FOUGHT IN WW2 WERE NOT NAZIS!!! Hitler and his Nazis took control of Germany and took control of the German army, navy, and air force. Just because Franklin Roosevelt was a democrat doesn't mean all our troops in WW2 were democrats. And remember this...OSCAR SCHINDLER WAS A NAZI, but like some Nazis, he did not believe the lies of Hitler and his supporters.Schindler's List was a truly great movie, but Spielberg has become a liar when he made this awful propaganda flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SS steals from "Blair Witch"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first several minutes (after an introductory scene) show a vivid description of D-Day on one of the beaches invaded by American forces. Anyone who has read Cornelius Ryan's _The Longest Day_ already has images like those in his head (read the book, it's one of the best histories ever written). It starts the problem. There's too much of a jerky-camera effect. It's acceptable in the battle scene, but hardly in the rest of the movie, rendering it unwatchable for people like me.What I did see was a pretty fair fictional story based on a true story. Of course, a director like SS is hardly going to tell just a story, but has an agenda he's working behind the scenes, manipulating us into some snare or other where we have to accept his worldview on things. After all, we just *saw* it -- so it must be that way, right?Unfortunately, I couldn't see enough of it because of the camera work to try to decipher his hidden agenda. I don't even know how the movie came out, and frankly I don't care. Cloying as SS is in all his movies, this film is curiously unengaging, and the characters show little advance (Nazi, American GI) from the "Indiana Jones" films, which are still his best achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupid is maybe the wrong way to describe it. But after hearing SO much about it and reading here that it´s the "best war movie ever", I was sorely disappointed.First of all, the "great exciting 30 minutes" beginning nearly gave me an epileptic seizure with all that jerky camera movement. I´m glad I watched this on DVD and not in the cinema, because I could turn on the subtitles, otherwise I wouldn´t have understood a word of what the characters were saying because of all that BANG! BOOM! EXPLOSION!The plot. Well, the ridiculous plot has been discussed to death here by many others, so I won´t get into it. The "great surprise ending"? I saw that coming from the beginning, but maybe that´s because the movie isn´t called "Saving Private Ryan", but "Der Soldat James Ryan" over here. That reminds me, the Germans, when they were speaking german, were pretty horrible (I watched the original english version) - I doubt those were authentic Germans, which is strange because Spielberg usually thrives on authenticy.Finally, there was too much comedy (especially that "Here, I am James Ryan" thing, that was so weak) for a serious war movie. I can do with the bickering of the soldiers among each other, but this movie was a bit overdoing it - it´s cool in an Indiana Jones movie, because hey, Indy´s an action COMEDY, but here, it didn´t work.</fullReview>

While SPR is certainly a technical tour de force, in emotional, spiritual, historical and narrative terms it stinks, for the same reason most of Spielberg's films (with the exception of Schindler's List, marvellous) stink: the man has no vision, and little or no artistic integrity. (Why else does he churn out rubbish like Jurassic Park II? I'll tell you why - money.)SPR is dishonest, silly and trite, an insult to the men who died in the real D-Day landings. The story premise, as others here have pointed out, is risible, the framing device unnecessary and stupidly sentimental. How anybody over the age of 9 can rate this film higher than genuine masterpieces such as Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front or Cross of Iron is beyond me. Still, a lot of people who visit this site think Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are the greatest films ever made, which probably explains something.Watch the first 20 minutes, and then switch off.

		<shortDescription>Skip Private Ryan and watch Band of Brothers!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the 'immaculate' appraisals of this film, I am compelled to explain WHY this film sucks. Sadly, these days there is a declining number of people who can properly and objectively evaluate movies just as there are less and less movies worth evaluation. First, this movie DID NOT win Best Picture. Why? For a WWII epic from Spielberg with this Hollywood cast, unlimited budget, and the notoriety, it speaks volumes about the movie itself that it did not win. The movie had many aspects which merited praise. But far more of it deserved our disdain and disappointment. It is a shame that so few movie viewers can observe the following egregious flaws in a film trumpeted by most here as 'the best war film ever'. First, let me say that the film had only ONE redeeming quality- that of the battle scenes. Very impressive in every way. That's it. That's all. It's all downhill from here. The main failure of this film lies in the fact that it does NOT draw in the audience. There is NO cohesion of characters, zero empathy. I did not care at all about any of the soldiers. Why? Mainly because they were all well-known actors stupidly picked by Spielberg, and there were LOTS of them- just read the cast of actors. This is a huge distraction. I cannot feel the soldiers' pain and grief when they are ALL actors I've seen in movies and TV shows. What a STUPID, boneheaded, amateur mistake by Spielberg. Every scene in the movie has a another actor I know pretty well and whose personalities distract me. Further, all the actors seemed like they did not 'fit' in the 1940s era. They seemed too modern. Too anachronistic. They used too many curse words (which were not used in those days, at least to that degree) and were really 'cheesy'. They all seemed like actors, NOT real soldiers- AND cheesy BAD actors at that. After watching Band of Brothers, one can really identify with the characters, all the characters not just the 'band'. But in Ryan, there is literally ZERO compatibility with the actors. They didn't 'flow' together like fellow soldiers- all seemed to be out of place- hamming up the screen; too much for viewers to take in. Again, the fact that they are ALL well-known actors (and the cameos by Ted Danson and others made it really Hollywoodish and corny). Essentially, I just didn't care remotely about any of the actors- simple. Another annoyance were Hollywood 'touches' like the cheesy prayer the sniper man made every time he aimed for a shot or the annoying Jewish remarks actor/comedian Goldberg made throughout or Diesel's tough-guy mantra, or Tom Hanks' continuous confused 'look'. Spielberg also displayed a disproportionate amount of anti-German efforts. He made typical German soldiers (not the SS) out to be vicious monsters, a lot of which might be true, but the bias was very distracting in the movie. Seeing a freed German soldier return to kill Tom Hanks (the one who freed him) as well as the German who mercilessly and VERY slowly with a knife pierced the only Jewish solider's heart as he begged for mercy and cried...was a very excessive and blatant anti-German effort by Jewish Spielberg- upsetting mostly because it changed the tone of the movie in a very obvious way. Anyway, the entire movie needed more development and the characters (each of them) were severely miscast. It is an obvious Hollywood production which lacks authenticity NOT in the action and special effects, BUT in something far more important in ANY film---plot, script, good acting, and empathy. Private Ryan misses the boat. Strongly recommended is Band of Brothers. Instead of cheesy Tom Hanks acting in it, he directs and does a brilliant job. The series is addictive and priceless...and it makes Private Ryan look like a high school production- thank God the Oscars had the courage to deny it Best Picture. But not enough courage to deny Spielberg Best Director- they wouldn't dare do that. LOL. 'nuff said.</fullReview>

This movie's storyline is completely ridiculous the American Army would not spend that much time looking for one private they have bigger and better things to do.For historical accuracy it 5.5 although the props and costumes and terminology is accurate the entrance where the soldiers are scrambling for safety isn't Americans did have air support but the American pilots were so bad at math the miscalculated and hit there own men.I think this movie is a load of American loving bull and a real WWII movie should covers all the perspectives of EVERY nation not just one.

		<fullReview>The technical aspects of "Saving Private Ryan" (effects, scenery,... ) have been done in a really good way. But unfortunately, that's the only good thing to say about the movie.*spoilers ahead*The movie can be divided into two parts: The landing at Omaha Beach, and the mission to save Private Ryan.The landing is by far the better part. And yet it fails: The watcher doesn't get involved into the (technically perfect) action on the screen. Men are mowed down by machine gun fire, and you couldn't care less. And a war movie that doesn't make the watcher feel the cruelty of war is a failure...After the landing, things become worse:- The entire premise of the second part (saving a Private who's three brothers died) is pathetic - and it's even presented in a even more pathetic way.- The main characters are faceless (only Tom Hanks' and Jeremy Davies' roles got some profile), and you don't really care about them.- The 'enemy' is not only faceless, too. He's also dumb. His only purpose in the film is to mindlessly rush forward to be gunned down by G.I.s. (making all the fighting feel fake)- Too many 'coincidences' that pull the movie along (Ryan is just where he's most needed, the bridge get's blown away 'at the last moment possible',...)- The film is predictable, making a lot of the 'search' for Private Ryan pointless and the discussions about the mission pointless (Private Ryan is not dead, as anybody expects anyway. No, he did not return to base. Yes, he's fighting the Germans. No, he won't leave his comrades. Yes, the rescue team stays to man the defense.)- It has all elements of a Hollywood movie (except the love scene): a main character that proves worthy, a main character that dies for what he believes in, a man that proves manhood by killing for the first time, the American flag at the end (and everywhere else), the treacherous bad guy...*end of spoilers*Conclusion: It's your 08/15 American feel good war movie. Don't expect anything more... (If you want something more 'real' watch "Full Metal Jacket", "Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now")</fullReview>

Every team member knew its hardship.The opening battle that happened in Omaha beach was fierce and unforgettable. The similar scenes also occurred in wonderful TV series Band Brothers. When Miller led seven people to execute the mission, that reminded me of The lord of the rings. Of cause the task in TLOTR was more difficult.Life is precious. However a war can easily kill many people. The war is ruthless so that you must be cold-blooded or get killed in battlefield.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a top WWII film and I've seen it a dozen times. As the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. Suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the D-Day Assualt. In the assualt, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his platoon up and around the German lines for a flank attack. Across the ocean, a mother receives three KIA letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) will be found in France and sent home. On the Normandy beach, Captain Miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across France to find Private Ryan and battle across the German lines. Through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.Steven Spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. Tom Hanks is strong, smart and above all good as Captain Miller. There is also a surprise with one of Vin Diesel's first roles as Private Caparzo. The violence is brutal, bloody, and well crafted. Each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.Saving Private Ryan.

		<shortDescription>Typical, manipulative, sentimental Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which, if you know anything about The 'Berg's intention for the film, was not the point. This movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as "one of the best war movies ever made". Imagine my disgust when I saw it...The opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the action/horror, but it relies solely on Spielberg's ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewing.Personally, I knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on. To be precise, I knew it when, in the midst of this mind-blowing battle sequence, Spielberg thought it'd be fun to throw in a joke about Sizemore being Hanks' mother.WHY?!? He had everyone on the edge of their seat (literally, I remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped) and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking JOKE?!?From here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage, as we are dragged through a war-is-hell-by-numbers affair. Never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate, Spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising, Ted Danson trying to be serious (yes, Ted Danson), a token "death of the youngest soldier" tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue I have ever suffered, which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of two-dimensional characters ever assembled for a movie.Then there's the premise; a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol' compassionate Uncle Sam thinks the titular soldier's poor Ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons. Is this a joke?!?"But it's a true story" I hear you cry. Wrongo! It may have been inspired by a true story, but that doesn't mean that anything beyond the name James Ryan actually existed. The words "inspired by a true story" don't mean a thing these days and, let us not forget, this is Spielberg.Let us not forget indeed, as Stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces, even if they are overlong, predictable, and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it. The final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious, A-Team style montage that precedes it, in which we see our apple-pie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village, before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty Germans.Perhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against Terrence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line', and subsequently taking the two Oscars which by right belonged to the latter (Best Director and Best Cinematography).'Ryan's Privates' pales in comparison not just to Mallick's film (as well as to Spielberg's other "classic" manipulative-therapy session, 'ET') but to almost every war movie I have seen ('Cross of Iron', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'All Quite on the Wetsern Front'), even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously ('Mash', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Eagle Has Landed'). One great battle scene does not a great war movie make, but try telling the Academy that.Bottom line? Don't expect more than a sub-par Spielberg offering and you won't be disappointed. Expect a profoundly moving war classic, and you'll be choking on your rage like I was when I left the cinema nine years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Stories and Kelly's Heroes in one movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is similar to the other Stephen Speilburg productions like "The Pacific" and "Band of Brothers." These productions focus too closely on the individual soldiers sentimental personal problems. Combat strategy and the historical accuracy of wartime is significantly diminished with the "slice of life" theme adopted here. Consequently, the poor screen writing matches the "sentimental" theme which is out of place for a wartime historical combat production. Saving Private Ryan was made using ideas from "Kelly's Heroes" (1970)and an episode from "Amazing Stories" about D Day (Charlie Sean) and were put together to make a silly war fiction aka Saving Private Ryan. There is a scene in the movie where the squad of soldiers are seen casually walking in farmland of the French countryside near Carentan behind enemy lines (taken from Kelly's Heroes). The casual walk is grossly inaccurate to history. It would have been impossible to stroll in the open French farmland near Carentan as featured in private Ryan because the Germans had sophisticated defense lines or "belts" constructed everywhere and where machine gun nests and large caliber guns were often placed at several locations to intercept the same targets which proved very deadly for the allies. The Saving Private Ryan squad would have been spotted and dealt with very quickly. The allies had to use combined operations with tanks, aircraft and artillery to destroy the sophisticated bunkers and dugouts the Germans constructed everywhere. The allies used high explosive shells to destroy enemy bunkers, cluster bombs, and special shells that would burst in the open air to kill soldiers caught in the open.Operation "Cobra" scheduled for 24 July 1944 was delayed because of deteriorating weather for 25 July 1944. However, one squadron of US bombers which took off wasn't recalled. General McNair the most senior American General in Normandy and hundreds of US personnel were killed when the squadron bombed too close to the operation Cobra "start lines." Saving Private Ryan is a silly wartime fiction movie similar to "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific" where there is too much emphasis with the soldiers sentimental personal problems. The combat scenes recreated by Stephen Speilburg are devoid of combat strategy and historical accuracy. The combat scenes in Saving Private Ryan are just slugging matches. I would prefer to have seen Jerry Bruckheimers productions of "Saving Private Ryan" and "Band of Brother" and "The Pacific."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instead of sitting through this ridiculous movie, I wish I had washed the dishes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To borrow from one of the more absurd lines in the movie, 'maybe getting the dishes out of the way would be the one decent thing we managed to pull out of this whole god-awful mess.' I'd have expected the producer of 'Schindler's List' to know better than to allow the actual line I reference to remain in a story about WWII.By the way, having failed to have the good sense at the first one, I certainly should have walked out at the second portrayal of a soldier on death's door crying out loud for his mother as battle raged around him. "Best war movie" indeed. In my opinion, even if 'Saving Private Ryan' hadn't been irritatingly implausible, it still would have been plain silly.</fullReview>

SPR is poorly acted, the cinematography is below average and the entire movie is flawed with inaccurate and misleading information. This movie is an example of what is wrong with Hollywood and the way big studio movies are made, thier #1 objective is to make money off the movie at any cost even if that means turning out a piece of garbage that leads the public to believe this is the best out there, when in fact the opposite is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Way Beyond "Saving"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has once again lost the plot. This was a terrible war movie covering no new ground, but instead recycling the same old war issues in a dull manner. The opening scene was spectacular for five minutes and boring for the next twenty minutes. Enough is enough. In typical Spielster fashion the movie was too long, and the Spielster had way too much money in his budget. I would love to see him use some creative material like his 70's movies such as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". How humiliated the Spielster must have felt after comparing the superb "The Thin Red Line" next to his babbling mess.Sorry Spielster, 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between hobnobbing in Martha's Vinyard, Spielberg has, as we know, been trying to claim the holocaust, slavery, war, and other ethical properties as his (American) own. Now there is an ambition.The message for this film can well be construed as Do What the General Says, Because It's the Right Thing to Do. Feel Good About Agonizing Over This Question, But Do What The General Says (AKA "shoot and weep"). It's an old (my apologies) Fascist trick. Raise a genuinely important, painful issue, then sooth the pain with a quick, unambiguous appeal to both duty and moral recognition, the split between moral recognition and action here acts as the ethical seal of approval. Would we not all like life to be so simple...Sadly there have been other cases in more recent history where a similarly confident recommendation, Bear the Pain of Pulling that Trigger with Loyal Pride, seem to have landed everyone in serious trouble. History may never repeat itself, but Spielberg is out to prove us wrong.Rating should, perhaps, be, not quite "1" for "awful," but rather "10" for inducing shock and awe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa, I have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be anti-american.Now dont get me wrong, the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie. You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.I think part of the problem was my expectation. I was expecting a real anti-war film, one that leaves you thinking, you know, that war is bad. This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of "All quiet on the Western front". Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of "shudder" Germans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Film with a Difficult Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is, more or less, a character study, not of only one person, but of U.S. philosophy. Why send a squad to find one guy and send him home? The premise is that the mother had already lost 3 of her 4 sons to the War (World War II, or the Great Patriotic War), and that she should not be expected to lose her 4th and final son to the War. She had lost 75% of her children, and shouldn't have to lose 100% of her children.However, what about the mother who watches her only child go off to war? If he dies, she already lost 100% of her children to war. It's an issue that comes up many times in the film, and we get to see every man in the squad fight with this issue in his own mind during the film.The "Private Ryan" character (Matt Damon) fights with this issue too. He's already been designated as an object of hatred and contempt by the entire squad, before they even meet him. He understands that the mission is both justified and ludicrous, at the same time. He didn't ask to be "rescued", and he doesn't want to be rescued, but he seems to understand why he should be rescued. He represents the feeling that the USA shouldn't lose all of its children to the War.The main characters are a brilliant mix...The captain, who is fulfilling his duty to his country in its time of need.The sergeant... a crusty old lifetime war veteran... the kind of guy who actually eats MREs because he likes the taste.The sniper... a soldier who feels that his God gave him an amazing gift, specifically for the purpose of defeating the German army.The Jew... who joined the army specifically to fight against the anti-Jewish Nazis.The "Tough Guy"... an almost Mafia-like character from New York City, who has no problem with getting in the face of his Sergeant, and even his Captain.The "Good Guy"... who initially seems like a Tough Guy, but ends up being a soft-hearted guy who royally screws up by trying to save the life of a little girl in a war zone, at an inopportune moment.I didn't really care for Giovanni Ribisi's character in the film. The character just didn't seem realistic to me. However, the rest of the cast is a total Home Run.The film does a great job of capturing the horrors and realism of first-person warfare, and the story is awesome, too. Surely, one of Spielberg's finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth seeing, but I don't get the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people who say this is the best war movie, I can't help but wonder if any of those people have some of Stanley Kubrick's war films. Dr. Strangelove and The Paths of Glory IMO are so much better than Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan visually and technically is far superior to the other films. But the story isn't a gripping story which feels like it has an very powerful message. Largely because it's centered around WW2 which was a war which was necessary for the allies to fight in. The more compelling films IMO are the ones centered around wars and encounters which represent the costs of wars for little if any benefit. I'd say that Warhorse is a better film than Saving Private Ryan too.Saving Private Ryan does display the real bravery and horrors of WW2. But that is nothing particularly new. Just about every WW2 film does that. The main story-line of rescuing Ryan is what is the biggest turnoff to me. The film even addresses the issue of their order to rescue Ryan. It's not smart to put an entire team of many people in danger in order to try to rescue one soldier in the middle of a battlefield. Many other soldiers die, and Ryan, even when found doesn't feel he deserves to be rescued. He even insists that they keep fight off their enemy rather than leave right away. My inquiry is that if our Nation objects to too many family members dying in battle, why allow so many of one family to fight? Probably my favorite parts of the film were the side stories not directly related to Saving Ryan at all. I like the story of the translator going from a coward to a killer. I like the part of the film where they discuss whether it's right or wrong to escape a Nazi Trap or put themselves and their mission at risk in order to spring the trap. And of course the D-day invasion sequence is incredibly powerful.The film is certainly worth watching, and many people it's great, but I just find it OK, and certainly not one of the best War films. I don't know if it would even crack my top 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers, Ho! The first scene in the Normandy cemetery of Saving Private Ryan is enough to put me on my knees and from there it gets even more emotional as we see the faces of the troops about to be the first to set foot on Omaha Beach which has since become a synonym of hellish warfare. It's hard for me to watch anything about vets of WWII without losing it. Just the damn trailer for Saving Private Ryan deserves an Academy Award. Brilliant.The acting is great to not-so-great depending on the actors (and non-actors). I think you call it "screen presence" wherein you like seeing some people while others make you cringe. Great: Tom Sizemore, Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovani Ribisi, Matt Damon, Adam Goldberg. I won't go into detail on those I didn't like but to contrast the cast of this movie just take a look at Band of Brothers. I loved every character in that series. I just dotted down a few thoughts as I watched this classic for the umpteenth time: The initial fight for the beach was about as intense as movies about war can be.Although a visual masterpiece, the scene of the official car going to the home of the slain soldiers was a bit over-the-top as far as Americana. She should have been baking an apple pie. Any home in American, any crappy flat in New York would have served the same purpose without being quite as maudlin.Vin Diesel couldn't get killed too soon for me. In the opening credits would have been better but this was soon enough.There is no freaking way they would have let that German soldier go. He would have picked up the first available weapon and continued fighting.The pansy translator kid was terrible, both he and his role. I didn't like anything about him and the film would have been better without this character. There is a right and a wrong way to do smarmy.Dying sucks, we get it already. I just thought they over-did this a bit. I realize this is a movie about one of the bloodiest wars ever but the long, drawn-out death scenes became corny and not dramatic.There were a couple of great moments in the film. When Tom Hanks sort of splits through the tension verging on mutiny with the story of where he is from and what he did was the best of scene in the film. Matt Damon's dialogue about the last night with his brothers could have used a little work (the story about his brother trying to screw some ugly chick in the barn).</fullReview>

That is just the first 20 minutes. Unbeatable storytelling, cast and performances. A must see for all! Tom Hanks at his best. It contains all the elements of noble storytelling which is representational of all nations who fought on D-Day. This movie captures the fear and terror as can only be imagined by those whom were not there. I myself got a true taste of that fear while strapped into a Chinnok Helo over Afghanistan in 2011 when we were shot at. To be trapped in a bus with no way out but forward through the hail of maelstrom is an experience I will. Never forget, and I am eerily reminded about during the opening scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic." Joseph Stalin. The most renowned war epic of modern times and perhaps all times exemplifies this quote quite well, though not perfectly. Now, I'm sure that the Normandy invasion sequence was extremely emotional for those who were present for it or who had relatives and friends die in the attack. But for the rest of the audience, I would expect that the following scene that tells of the three Ryan brothers' deaths was more striking. Sometimes I feel bad when I watch movies depicting tragedy like this one, because I don't always feel for the characters' sufferings. I know I'm supposed to, but it just doesn't always happen. I only share this because there are probably people who feel the same way and maybe it will help them make sense of their own lack of sympathy.That aside, I can see why this is held in such high regard. It has great visual and audio quality in the battle scenes, an all-star ensemble, multiple emotionally charged characters, historical significance, a simple plot, decent character development, and an above average script that is translated proficiently on camera by Spielberg. None of these made watching it a great experience. It certainly didn't top any of my lists and was frankly rather forgettable. But I was still able to appreciate it for what it was. But part of appreciating it is having ties to the war itself, which is something that cannot be gained intentionally.There could probably have been less minor characters included. Had they been based on real people or generated conflict or been more important to the thru line, I wouldn't say this, but there got to be too many of them. You recognize each one and get to know them a little, but are never thinking about them when they aren't on screen. It's a little disappointing, but probably intentional that Private Ryan gets more character than most of Miller's soldiers in about a third of the amount of screen time.If you're concerned about it being American patriotic propaganda, I wouldn't watch it if you're going to be trying to pick out propaganda. The vast majority of it is subtle. The characters question their mission but never once question the war as a whole. Private Ryan's aversion to going home is more blatant, as are the voice-over letters to soldier's families. The portrayal of the one German soldier might put some people off. He isn't portrayed as evil, but you could argue that he is made an object of ridicule for the audience.Don't watch this if you don't like long run times. The scenes are put to good use, but the movie as a whole could easily have been made shorter and retained its quality. I'll let you make your own decision on whether to watch the Normandy invasion, but be warned that it is very gory and uncompromising in its depiction. If you like any of the actors, expect a good performance from them, but don't expect that to make it a great movie for you. There are some slow parts, so don't choose this if you're looking for action. Prospective viewers looking to make a career in making action movies and special effects should definitely watch this, or at least study the D-Day invasion scene and the climax. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.</fullReview>

I am a fan of military movies because they are empowering to see how we must stick together. I really like how the color correction put me in the action along with them. The camera movement was on point. I would love to work on a film like this. I could relate to this movie because my father use to be in the military. What really got my attention was the sniper scene where they were trying to save that little kid and family stuck on a roof top in the rain was deep. Then the sniper begins to shoot one of the soldiers. That sound of a broken piano was kind of shocking. This movie is a great film and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie hit me hard with emotion with just the first 15 minutes. The infamous opening scene is something you can never truly prepare for. Sure, gore isn't the worst for many. However, I remember when I first saw it at a young age I cried because I knew that ever injury you see happened to a real person at one point in our history. The thing I appreciated most about this movie is that there was not sugar coating anything. The people in this movie are mirroring true events, meaning that people do die and people suffer. You go back and forth on the reasoning behind the plot, which is sending a group of men to save just one life. It really plays with your mind. A group of men are worth more than just one, right? But what about that one man's mother who already lost three of her four sons? There is no right answer in a situation like that. Someone has to suffer. And that's what happened in the war to so many real people. This movie is a great reminder to appreciate where we are now. There are people out there to this day who are still suffering because of this war, while we live our everyday lives. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone (maybe not the younger ones out there considering the gore) because it is a great portrayal of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror of war, never more brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about the near 30 minute opening scene, how graphic and scary it was. I had actually dreamed about these scene before watching this film, and there an all too haunting identity to it. This was D day, a.k.a the battle of Normandy, where those small navy boats came onto the shores, and the soldiers were picked off like chickens at a shooting gallery. Many didn't make it ashore, where others that made it ashore, became bloody graphic examples of what this deadly and horrific war was like. This is the most scariest and bloodiest scene I've seen in a war film, where it's near thirty minute duration as it violently depicted what went down, in depth, highly benefited, but made the rest of the other film drop, or seem standard, but I mean that, only in contrast, to the war sequence, which really set the bar high, in one sense. The scene prior to this, in the cemetery, which comes back at the end, makes this story only the more heartbreaking, as we view a sea of graves, just to show you, how shockingly easy the lives of these boys were lost. Now moving on, Captain John Miller (Hanks) assigns a squad to track down one Private Ryan, risking the lives of his squad for this one guy. There are more shockingly violent bits in this too, the atmosphere in the last thirty, resembling that of the ruins in Full Metal Jacket, which unlike that, this one remarkably dodged an R certificate. What surprised me, acting wise, was Vin Diesel as one of Hanks squad, who unfortunately buys it early in the piece, while Hanks wasn't bad, but I have seen better from him, while Barry Pepper again steals their thunder. I like Ted Danson's brief performance too, as another squad captain we bump into on our search for that one party, where his two other brothers didn't make it. I'll be frank, SPR has a very unsettling and frightening aura to it, like I've never felt in any other war film. Another way of saying this, is in the how "easy to die" scenario which which I've never felt stronger as in this. Spielberg, again, has pulled off something respectfully and undeniably brilliant, but as someone who's created the most scariest war film, I've ever seen, he should be widely commended, where this film should of walked away with the best film Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks delivers a phenomenal performance (of course). Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper, and Edward Burns give great support to Hanks. The story is good and the war scenes are believable and well shot. The majority of action movies are completely unrealistic (the protagonist is invincible and cannot miss his/her target while their enemies die like flies and can't hit their target if it were standing still). Saving Prvt Ryan is much more realistic and most of the "good guys" die (unfortunately the ones I liked were the ones that died). This is more of a drama and adventure movie rather than action as the team has to find Ryan behind enemy lines. Other than D-Day and the final fighting scene, this is more of an action film than most war movies.Some say that this movie is not historically accurate. I don't think that is such a big deal in determining whether or not a movie is good or not. Saving Private Ryan is a great movie for its action, acting, and story! I still can't believe that it did not receive an academy award for best picture. 10 stars easy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the present day, an elderly World War II veteran and his family visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Normandy, France. The veteran walks around the cemetery and, upon seeing one specific gravestone, collapses to his knees, overwhelmed by emotion.The film flashes back to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy Invasion, as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. Captain John H. Miller, a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with "S. Ryan" inscribed on the back of his uniform, is shown.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C, at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy. Marshall, after reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter, orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately.Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company? T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Private First Class Richard Reiben, Privates Stanley Mellish, Adrian Caparzo, Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade?and T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer who speaks French and German, loaned from the 29th Infantry Division. Miller and his men move out to Neuville; there, they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the acting in the movie was absolutely amazing! I loved how I could feel the emotions pouring out of each of the characters! In addition to that, the D-Day scene was one of the most memorable and realistic scenes I have ever seen in a movie depicting war. In my opinion, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks need to start making movies about both the Vietnam war, as well as, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This would be helpful to both veterans and civilians wanting to have a better understanding of the wars. When Pvt. Jackson got blown up in the tower I felt so demoralized because Miller's men were dying left and right. Making it harder for Pvt. Ryan to be safely extracted from the battle. This movie will always be one of my favorites and it would be amazing to sit behind the scenes and watch as this kind of movie is made. I definitely hope to meet both Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg one day, in order to gain better insight as to what enables them to make such spectacular movies!!</fullReview>

Throughout this movie we see Tom Hanks play as a captain as he leads these other soldiers through Europe against the dreaded Nazi army. Tom Hanks character makes a sacrifice and Matt Damon's character respects that and in the end the war is won thanks to the Allies. This is definitely a great film directed by the great Steven Spielberg and it deserves him an Oscar for best director. This film is also the 1998 Oscar winner for best picture.

		<fullReview>You could watch the first scene of this film and think: "this is a great scene, but why is this necessary?" But really, this scene lays out the foundation for the rest of the film. The scene shows how fragile life is in war. How a man could die right next to you within a matter of seconds and you may not even notice. It also shows how all hope seems to be crushed by war, showing a man nearly being hit by a bullet and checking his helmet, but only getting shot in the head seconds later. It also shows men trying to revive a man on the ground, and just as they stop the bleeding, the man is shot in the head. The film shows this later in a scene involving Vin Deasel attempting to save a child from a building in the middle of a war zone, only to be shot by a sniper and have that child go back to his parents. It shows how there are no clear good guys and bad guys and how the Americans aren't necessarily any better than the other guys by showing men killing unarmed troops from the other side for, well, no reason. It shows this later in a scene in which the once naive Timothy is spared by a German soldier, and then kills an unarmed soldier who he spared earlier in the film only to have him be put back into circulation and kill more men, showing also how drastically it changes men. It even shows how Captain Miller must find hope in the face of all the horrible things happening around him by muting all the sound and using slow motion, both techniques that are used in a similar situation towards the end of the film as a call back. After this fantastic scene, however, the men of Captain Miller's squad are called on a mission to save the final son of a mother who has lost her three other sons to this war only recently. The men are obviously confused by why they would need to risk all of their lives to save one man, and the film teeters back and forth on whether this mission is worth it or not. At many points it seems futile, especially after a second soldier is killed off in an incredibly heart wrenching scene in which Miller asks the dying medic what they can do to help him to which he responds with simply "some morphine would help". But in many places they seem to find possible hope. A high ranking officer tells Miller "I have a brother. You get that boy home". And when they accidentally find the wrong Private Ryan and inform him that his brothers are dead, even after he is told that he is not the guy the were looking for, just the idea of his brothers being dead tears him apart, showing the importance of a single person. Then also when they are loudly searching through dog tags to find a Private Ryan, only to realize that a squadron full of people that fought with those men are walking by. This shows that to them what is a meaningless name could have incredible significance to others. When they do end up getting to Ryan, it turns out he doesn't want to be saved. If he dies he says to tell his mom that he died with the only brothers that he had left. But Miller decides that if they save Private Ryan it might be the only decent thing that they've done in this horrible situation, and then they could truly earn their right to go home. But the victory is a long shot, and many people die in the process, including Miller. But Private Ryan survives, and in Miller's dying breaths he tells Ryan to "earn this". Ryan ends up living the rest of his life trying to live up to Captain Miller's command and earn this opportunity to live that many died to give him. So, was it even worth it?Well, its not black and white, but the film argues yes, to some extent. Many men may have died, and many may have been permanently damaged, both emotionally and physically. And they may not know the good that they have done for the world, but as Private Ryan talks to Miller's grave in his old age, his wife and kids and grand kids lurk behind him, showing that if it weren't for people like Miller, many people today wouldn't exist. For every one man that is saved, many more get the chance to live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so I probably saw saving private Ryan when I was a little too young. I believe I was 11 years old when I saw it (not in theaters) I begged and begged my parents to finally rent it so I could see it. I remember I saw bits and parts of it when my sister and dad were watching it once and, for some reason, I, even as a kid, was fascinated by WWII. Anyway, they finally caved and went against there better judgment to get me to shut the heck up and we rented it one weekend. Now, the incredible intensity and realism of the violence in this movie is so well done, it left me shocked for a few days afterwards. I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Once that shock wore off I realized what a powerful movie it was and even at a young age the amount of respect I developed for the heroes of WWII was deep. I believe everyone should at least see this movie (and band of brothers) to appreciate the sacrifice that military members, past and present, give to their country's people. The masses watch TV show after TV show of gratuitous violence with glee because it portrays it as a whimsical thing that has little impact on those around it. Which is of course ridiculous. Saving Private Ryan does NOT glorify war or violence, but leaves it for what it is; a devastation to humanity. However once this is realized the respect for the heroes who go through it goes beyond words, which is captured beautifully in the film's soundtrack. We need not forget the heroes of the past. Anyway, on a technical standpoint the film will never be outdone: the sets, the practical effects, the cinematography, everything is perfect to capture the intensity of combat. The acting and script (while some have claimed it used a lot of stereotypes I disagree to an extent, but that is another argument) is all fantastic and Spielberg is at his absolute best. This is one of those films that transcends "entertainment" and "media" and everything commercial about movies and becomes something a lot more: It is a tribute, and a powerful one at that. Aside from the violence and intensity there are also a few very heartwarming scenes (when they find where Ryan is from the deafened paratrooper and when Ryan tells the captain about his brothers to just name a couple if you didn't believe me) Tom Hanks is at his best as well, I feel his acting was on a different multitasking level in this movie. He is fully consumed by his character. Anyway, perfect and powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie - NEWS Flash...It's a Movie...Not History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this movie is ONLY 250 out of 250? Once again I have to wake myself up and realize that tastes are subjective and very, very dated. I can come to terms with that reality but I just don't understand why some really useless garbage gets rated higher than this flick. Is this a pro-war movie? Well, 'yes', if you are an idiot. Are there historical flaws in this production? Really? You are upset about that? I guess you don't know where the library is. Now I know that there are many of my fellow reviewers who just don't give out tens?or even nines?like me. I am a ratings tramp?I admit it. I hand out tens and nines like candy. Why? Because I can. And if you still see yourself as some kind of 'movie snob', good work, just don't tell me...I can only laugh so many times in a day. Also try not to stick your silly little pinky out in my presence, I might just snap it off at the knuckle. Phew, no worries?I am over it. All kidding aside, I will admit (with regret I guess) I am not one for smothering myself in self-love just-because-I-can-sit and watch a stupid movie, and then voice an opinion. A turnip can do that?OMG. And not being a turnip or any other kind of vegetable, I have made myself my own perfect Segway to voice my view. First: This movie is just a movie ? not history. Second: "Saving Private Ryan", although vaguely based on fact, is a product of Hollyweirdland, starring Hollyweirdos; directed by a Hollyweirdo. Note to reader: These folks often discard history and spin stories to their liking, increasing box-office cash-flow. Three: One of the best movies made, and this is from a whiner. Now it just so happens, the person directing this movie (Seven Spielberg) is probably one of the best out there. I like most of his stuff and some, I do not?but anything he does?it is always top quality. The camera work and acting are all pretty spectacular as well. The most talked about part of the movie is the harrowing display of carnage experienced by those just before hitting the beach. To think of the courage it took for a person to step around and over the mangled bodies of friends, you were just talking to, and at the same time, dodge ricocheting bullets. Accurate or not, fear and dread is brilliantly captured on film. To think of what each of these men were thinking, anticipating the worst and still, they carried on. That is unquestioned bravery. And then I see a review questioning the absence of British accents, really? And they mark the movie down for that? OK, to each his own, but I suggest you open a book son, and see where the Brits landed and where the US landed in Normandy. Better yet, take a trip to New Orleans and visit the World War Two National Museum in New Orleans. There you can talk to some actual survivors?not actors. If you wish getting your history first hand, make the trip these people are getting old. And please remember, we were trying to win a war ? a pretty serious one at that ?there was no time for tinkle-dances of spineless multiculturalism. OK, I am recovered. This movie is one-of-a-kind. I think what Mr. Spielberg did is a great thing. "Saving Ryan" also has a cast that is beyond reproach. I really like Tom Hanks. The guy is an 'Oscar Magnet'. If a producer is craving success, put Mr. Hanks in a scene full of blow-up dolls ? nomination for sure. I guess Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Ted Danson and Vin Diesel are included in the cast?but who are they? I kid. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen. I have watched movies once and through they were stupendous but never bothered to watch them again ? this one ? I can watch many times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's gripping epic, Saving Private Ryan was a film that went to great lengths to accurately depict the events of WWII. The 1998 Best Picture winner starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and a great ensemble cast tells the story of the sacrifice of many for the one. Conveying the message of brotherhood and sacrifice, Spielberg drove the message home through his grand WWII epic. Saving Private Ryan opens with the allied invasion of Normandy with an intensely elaborate 12-minute scene in which Spielberg captures the essence of war with incredible accuracy. During the invasion, two brothers are killed, along with many others. Previously, a third brother was killed as well and thankfully, a sharp-eyed stenographer noticed that the mother, Mrs. Ryan (Amanda Boxer) would be receiving all three telegraphs informing her of her 3 son's deaths on the same day. When the Army General, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) learns of a fourth enlisted brother, he takes the opportunity to alleviate the mother's stress and find the fourth brother and return him home safely to his family. Marshall assembles a group of 8 men on a death- defying mission to find Private Ryan and get him to safety. I will doubtfully never tire of a film told backward, as Saving Private Ryan was. We first meet an elderly gentleman that we later find out is present-day Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery with his family. Spielberg especially uses this technique to its full capacity in this film, allowing the audience to see how much sacrifice is worth when we see a trove of people that wouldn't have been possible without the mission to save Private Ryan. The opening battle scene with the invasion of Normandy was obviously intense and gripping. Spielberg went to great lengths to ensure the film's realism, even down to the positioning of body's on the beach. On a much lighter note, it was fun to see the cameos that were frequent and unexpected throughout the movie. We see Ted Danson and Bryan Cranston with bit parts in the film and unexpected big name cameos that don't distract from the story are always fun. There were several scenes with great use of characters storytelling throughout the film. This device was well utilized and helped distract from how much the film slowed down in the middle, or how needlessly long some of the battle scenes were. I typically find Spielberg films over the top and just aiming too hard for the jugular of the audience; Saving Private Ryan was probably doing those things too, but it was a better film in spite of it than some other Spielberg productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is an absolutely brutal portrayal of the Second World War. It is hard-hitting, unrelenting, but extremely powerful. Right from the start, it grabs the viewer by the throat. The first half hour of the film is a chaotic, confusing portrayal of the D-day landings, which I think is an accurate representation of what the landings must have been like. You wouldn't have known who was shooting at your or what was going on. It would have been hell on Earth.I also loved the camaraderie and loyalty that these soldiers showed towards each other. It is obvious that these men would fight to the death to protect themselves and their friends.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/rs2itZ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan is an action drama film that outlines a historical event in a realistic way. The emotion, violence, and realism that this film displays will make you feel as if you are there. The encompassing feelings of loss, grief, and sacrifice are real and this will show you a perspective into the trail events that follow war. This film is about so many things, but the focus is really on the courage and selflessness of the American soldier. The film opens up with an action packed scene detailing the battle of Normandy. Tom Hanks plays as Captain Miller whom leads his men, members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, through battle in order to secure the landing. During this battle, many soldiers are lost; among these soldiers are two brothers. General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, becomes aware that these two brothers along with a third whom was in New Guinea had all been killed in action. He realizes that their mother would be receiving notice that three of her sons would not be coming home. Therefore, when it is found that there is a forth brother enlisted, Private Ryan played by Matt Damon, the decision was made that he would be found and returned home to his mother immediately.This prompts Captain Miller, under the orders of the General, to assemble a team of eight soldiers from the 2nd Ranger Battalion to set out on a mission to establish contact with Private Ryan's unit, an element of the 101st Airborne Division. Throughout their mission, they come face to face with battle, sadness, bitterness, and challenges to fight for what they believe in. Captain Miller struggles through emotions and pain, but fights on keeping the moral and determination of the team moving forward with the ultimate goal of going home himself.Once Private Ryan is finally located, he refuses to leave his men to go home despite the news he just received of his late brothers. He explains that the men by his side are the only brothers he has left and that he will not leave them. This infuriates Miller and his team, but also inspires them. They fight together in an epic battle until reinforcements arrive; unfortunately, not everyone makes it home.The emotion in this film is undeniable. Sounds are a constant motif in this film from the beginning to the end. During big moments, such as battle, there are many sounds and details around and we are in that moment. The latter is that when there are close ups on characters, Captain Miller for example, we are seeing things in his perspective and hearing his thoughts as though he loses focus. A more recent film that has a similar theme is David Ayer's World War II flick 'Fury', where an army sergeant leads a team of five men to battle in hopes of accomplishing heroic ventures against the odds. The symbolism of the flag shown at the beginning and end of Saving Private Ryan are very relevant to the fact that freedom is not free and that without the men and women who devote themselves with courage and selflessness we could not be where we are today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie, period...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I liked this movie. Spielberg went the distance to create the real pain and terror of war with this panorama of death and bloodshed. The twenty minutes of Normandy footage is the most realistic I have ever seen, They cast real people with lost limbs to show how battles are carnage, not pretty scenery. Also, without making it obvious they showed how the invasion was completely thrown off track with airborne drops way off the intended marks. Simply put, the detail is authentic for every minute throughout the movie.Certainly, Saving Private Ryan was never intended to be a documentary. The individual plot is, of course, total fiction. Yet the plot is, and never was, the focus of the movie. The focus rather, is the individual honor that comes from deep within the human psyche, the fear and anger that was prevalent through the ranks. This is a movie about us in a way...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best War Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WWII has been an astoundingly ubiquitous and efficacious event in the movies ever since 1939. Not a year goes by that at least one film concerns itself with the war, it's belligerents, it's soldiers, it's politics or it's innocents. There are many reasons for this, including the death toll, the availability of film technology, the timing and the Nazis themselves, being perfect villains by the power of their twisted ideology. Yet even a superficial look at history will reveal evil taking many shapes causing comparable turmoil in it's wake across the millenniums. Why then are modern audiences (the vast majority of which are generations removed from the conflict) so viscerally affected by WWII specifically?The events of Saving Private Ryan are intended by military brass to be a moving piece of Army propaganda. The titular Private (Damon) is the youngest of four American farm-boy brothers, all of which were killed in the line of duty. Following the invasion of Normandy, Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his small company are tasked with going behind enemy lines to retrieve Private Ryan and bring him back before his mother at home collects yet another Army telegram. Along for the ride is the gruff Sgt. Harvath (Sizemore), the headstrong Private Reiben (Burns), Sniper Private Jackson (Pepper), Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) and three additional Privates Caparzo (Diesel), "Fish" (Goldberg) and Upham (Davies).The film's ensemble all-male cast does an outstanding job all-around, each having the acting chops and dexterity to expand on their characters in a way that forms naturally from the story and the situations. These men, though duty-bound and ultimately courageous are not the quaint cardboard cut-outs we've seen in sub-par G.I. Joe B-movies. They're human, frail and afraid though still have the gumption and intelligence and moral fortitude to see things through. At the center of the motley crew is Tom Hank's whose unsure Captain Miller does his best given an escalating mess of obstacles from both the defending Nazis and the confusion of the U.S. Army grouping and regrouping after every decisive battle.Yet Saving Private Ryan doesn't fall into the wry cynicism of The Americanization of Emily (1964) or the bitter fatalism of The Big Red One (1980). It doesn't choose to be quite as reductive as simply saying, "war is absurdity." Behind the grime, the rubble and the turmoil stands director Steven Spielberg's patented virtuous humanism, elevating the material to powerful heights. With a delicate but commanding hand, Spielberg fills the screen with moments of hope and nobility largely taking advantage of old- fashioned storytelling and Tom Hank's benevolent credibility. Every moment of affecting drama hits it's mark, reaching a satisfying crescendo that is guaranteed not to leave a dry eye in the theater.Of course no war drama, as poignant as it might be, can be complete without high-octane action which I'm glad to say Saving Private Ryan delivers big time. To enhance the realism of the various gun-battles and thunderous Army advances, Spielberg doesn't shy away from blood or gore, showing the inhumanity of war in all it's awful, shameful glory. The first battle, a shocking and adrenaline-pumping depiction of D-Day at Omaha Beach is quite frankly one of the best war scenes ever committed to film.While telling a real, complex and harrowing human story at the center of an inhumane war, Saving Private Ryan cuts through all the propaganda that made WWII the standalone cinematic force it was and arguably still is. Unlike the nationalistic one-reels of Frank Capra or the sinister celluloid works of Joseph Goebbels and company, Saving Private Ryan is a hard-nosed look at war from the perspective of those in the fray. It's exciting, bittersweet, scary, saddening and redemptive all in equal measure thus making Saving Private Ryan one of the best war films ever made.</fullReview>

Full of the horrors of war and sadness. Fantastic and realistic cinematography which puts you right into the war and convincing acting. Tom Hanks was as great as usual in this movie as you may have guessed. This movie is very violently explicit and gory as you may have seen and heard from other people and that is also true, this movie is harder to watch than most movies nowadays (e.g Fury, Inglorious Basterds, 300, The Hurt Locker etc). In the Normandy scene in the beginning of the movie, you see teenagers picking up there own body parts and one soldier lying in the sand with his guts exposed screaming for this mother in tears. This is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film of Honor and Sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is a film that is illustrated with such magnificent detail that it helps grasp your attention right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the credits start to roll. The hard work and dedication put in by the director, cinematographer, and actors in this film will make you leave the theater completely enthralled with tear-stained cheeks and puffy eyes. This film is set during World War II, particularly the Invasion of Normandy. As four brothers of the Ryan family enter the war their mother receives the news that three of them have died right at the start. Devastated at her loss, she sends orders to have them find her fourth son. This leads into the whole mission of the movie which is to find Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home. Tom Hanks is known for his work in dramas so it was no surprise that he was the perfect fit to play the leading role as Captain John H. Miller. He takes it above and beyond when he allows his voice to tremble and even get this glassy look in his eye as if he was experiencing war first hand. He plays the leader that everyone looks to when they are in desperate need for direction but he also portrays the man whose hands tremble due to the effect of war which makes him that much more fascinating to watch. Another character that catches your eye is that of Private Richard Reiben, played by Edward Burns. Burns' portrays a new new demeanor never seen by him before as he is not known for his acting in epic war dramas but comedies. Throughout the film, he is seen yelling into men's faces and giving off facial expressions that makes him look arrogant but then becomes soft as he realizes he can't do anything else to save Captain Miller. Seeing Burns play such a new role gives him that much more credibility and respect for his acting career. The credit of this film should go not solely to the actors, but to director Steven Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kami&#x144;ski who display so many different perspectives and angles that pull the film together. For example, when they show the death of Captain Miller they use an angle that shows who shoots him and him getting shot, pulling together the commotion of war and show his men avenging his death. They also took real footage from what actually happened during WWII and copied almost exactly how they saw it. By knowing that you just witnessed what actually happened in history makes the film that much more alluring than it already is. Considering the film starts off with a very graphic 27-minute battle scene at Omaha Beach, it sets the expectation that the rest of the movie would not be a waste of one's time. The reality of the film is one that needs to be rewarded due to the accuracy of the little details. Some of these details are the boats that replicated the ones used during WWII, the blood they used to completely engulf the water, and the scene which shows soldiers trying to find their severed limbs. Spielberg did not sugarcoat the harsh realities of war but instead used it to capture the audience's attention. Spielberg has definitely outdone himself in this film. It teaches one about American history but also one about honor and sacrifice. Through the agony and the loss, it is a film that will be shown to people for centuries to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In short, the single greatest war movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that everything you would ever see in 10 other war movies is shown in this movie in just the first 30 minutes. The amount of realism portrayed is unmatched. Starting with the seasickness you'd experience after traveling through the English Channel while sitting in a tightly compact boat, the tone immediately shifts to the desperation of survival in the battlefield, and the unlikeliness of making it out alive (with the body count stretching over 100 before this scene was over), complete with the pain, anguish, horror and loss (of limbs and sanity) all while showing the most accurate representation of a World War II era invasion ever put on film. Then it moves on to a deep character study of the individual squad trying to accomplish a single and very simple mission. Despite all wearing the same clothing, these characters are distinguished and relatable, with each character having their own mindset and opinions, some even talking about their past histories. These are human beings that you come to care about. You feel like you're part of the squad; you laugh when they're having fun and you feel the same stress that they feel when something's about to go wrong. By the time the movie's over, you really felt like you went through a war. From the visceral landings that introduced you to what the battlefield is like, to traveling with your fellow soldiers through the French countryside, always on your feet expecting to run into the enemy at any moment, to desperately attempting to complete your mission and win. If there was any war movie that anyone should see, it's this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan: Spielberg spills more blood than Tarantino has ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't many film directors as influential and recognizable as Steven Spielberg. He is mostly known for his fun films for almost all ages. Yet, one of his most acclaimed works to date is called one of the most violent, most realistic and grittiest depictions of war in cinema history. This is one of Spielberg's greatest movies.The film is set in the Normandy during World War II. Three of the four brothers named Ryan have fallen in battle. The military decides it is the best to escort the last brother, James Ryan (played by Matt Damon) back home, so that his family wouldn't lose all of their sons. Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks) is told to guide a group of soldiers (including actors such as Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davis among others) to find Ryan.The acting in Saving Private Ryan is very amazing. Tom Hanks is, as always, the master of his doings, but we have seen better roles by Tom Hanks a few times. Although he functions more like a McGuffin than an actual character, and has not so much screen time, Matt Damon has one of his best performances ever. The supporting actors Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davis do their job very well too.The cinematography in this films is among the best I have ever seen. In some scenes, like the famous Omaha Beach scene, at the beginning of the movie, the camera is very shaky, but you can still see what is going on. This adds to the tension of the scene. The visual style is very realistically brutal, as claimed by many historians and survivors of the D-Day battle.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best, if not the best, war movies ever made. Cinematography is flawless, acting is amazing and it is one of these films that truly show how terrible war actually is. This is a very depressing movie, but it also has some uplifting and even funny moments (like when Corporal Upham trips over the typewriter). To sum it up: this is about how far you can get from a movie being "fubar". 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie that injures mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I decided to watch again "Saving Private Ryan" with an intention to describe its general sense within couple paragraphs as a small review. But as soon as I've done it, I realized that my review cannot be as small as I intentionally planned.I would start with the main statement: this is the most massive movie about war I've ever seen. Notwithstanding it is a little bit too American, in my opinion. The movie impresses with its uncovered realism. Steven Spielberg, thrashing over his battle scenes, tried to make them be more like a news-reel from a battlefront. The close-ups, full of dynamics; a scenery detailed elaboration; a meticulous filling scenes with sound and colour: all these not just impress but stun and literally injure viewer's mind.The key episode of the first half of the movie is a landing attack on a beach of Normandy. In a first moment as hatches of troop- carrying vessels are open first rows of soldiers are sweeping away by stormly fire of large-calibre rifles. Others (with the imaginary camera- man) start to jump over from both boards of the boat. Several time we are drawn down and up again; as water cover us all sounds are being so muttered and meaningless and we feel ourselves almost safe. But then bullets starts to stitch the water body over and over. And the water turns red... Oh, I shouldn't try to retell what has been already geniusly filmed. These couple of minutes leave viewer completely breathless. And you believe in what you see from start to finish.And then the battle begins. No, I'm wrong, not the battle but slaughtery. It is shocking. The death is shown with all of its uncovered might. When I meet somewhere in a text or in TV a phrase like "he went through hell at that war", even it's not about WW2, but I remain this battle scene from this movie to help my mind understand the phrase better.Stephen Spielberg said about battle scenes of the movie that he wanted to represent them in a way to diminish tendency of violence embellishment.The cast is good, very good. Tom Hanks is a great actor and this is his greatest role, in my opinion. Yes, he is playing again his "mr. Good Guy" cliché, but it doesn't matter. Sincerely speaking, I do not much like American mentality, which shows most vividly in American stories about war, about American soldiers. And that's why I like Tom Hanks here: he made an image of Cpt. James Miller very close too my idea of what an officer should be. He could play a soviet officer for that story as well; there wouldn't be any dissonance at all. I like image he made very much.Once again: set design is amazing. You never doubt that this is a war in front of you, not for a moment. The war is every small detail: in every stone, in every building, in everywhere.But the storyline is not complicated at all. It's not bad, because it is so marvelously represented; even typical American messages in the beginning and in the end are not worsen my general feeling about the movie. I think these messages are even controversial to all other parts of the movie.My rate: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite war movies.... ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Pvt. Ryan is a war movie taken place during World War II, most notably during D-Day. Tom Hanks and Edward Burns star in this gritty, and war movie. Warning this movie isn't for the faint of heart. and those who have PTSD, this movie isn't recommended for you. non stop action war violence, and brief but strong language. like all movies it has its problems but not bad enough that it affects the movie badly. Its one heck of a movie and it was a pleasure seeing it. Cons: Barley any, lot of lens flares that are kinda distracting but that's all. Pros: good war movie, gory, a must for all of you gore-hounds out there. tug at your heart strings and it'll make you realize why war is hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of those movies that you can watch with regular intervals of time, and even if you've seen it multiple times and am familiar with the storyline, the movie is solid enough to be watched over and over, and keeps on being entertaining.The story, quickly summarized, is about a small squad of soldiers during the 2nd World War who are given a mission to find private Ryan in war-torn Europe after having survived the D-Day onslaught at Omaha Beach.What makes "Saving Private Ryan" good, is a combination of multiple things. First, of course, is the storyline. But also the way it is filmed, which puts the audience right in the midst of the action. Most importantly, though, is the more than impressive cast who perform above and beyond the call of duty so to speak, no pun intended.The action is formidable and impressive, showing that war is brutal and bloody. And it is presented in a very realistic manner, again adding to the conviction of the entire movie.The cast list for "Saving Private Ryan" was impressive. And there is a number of actors who really prove their acting talents and break out of the stereotypical roles and genres they tend to cling to. Tom Hanks, of course, is the center of the movie and he fitted so well into the role and the movie. Usually I am not particularly fond of Tom Sizemore, but he was perfect for this movie and did a great job. Ted Danson was a breath of fresh air, and he was a great addition to the movie, as were Paul Giamatti. Barry Pepper was phenomenal in his role and brought a good amount of flavor to the movie. However, for me, it was Jeremy Davies who was the most outstanding of all in the movie, proving once again what a phenomenal character actor he is.And it is always a plus when Germans actually do speak German in a World War 2 movie, and not have those awful German accents added when they in fact are speaking English."Saving Private Ryan" is a movie experience that everyone should have, at least once. It is an impressive and very entertaining movie to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of war film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg yet again brings together an all-star cast to create an influential war film. Saving Private Ryan tells the story of eight men who set out to find Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon, as his three brothers were killed in action. Their goal, is to find Private Ryan and send him home to his mother as he is her only child still living. The movie, set during WWII, shows not only the hardships of war but also what men are willing to go through to bring a fellow soldier home. These eight men, led by Captain Miller who is played by Tom Hanks must travel into enemy territory to retrieve Private Ryan and in doing so find themselves fighting for their own lives to do so. While the theme of the film is war, Spielberg directed his cast in a portrayal of courage. Showing what great lengths men will go through in such a troubling time. Courage could be referenced as part of the plot of this film but it can be argued that you can't have a film with war as the theme and not have this be a subsequent role in the film. Another element of this film would be the loss of life or disregard for life. In the film, soldiers are seen killing German soldiers who are attempting to surrender. This again relates to the main theme of war but also that in which life has no real value.Lighting was impactful for this film and appeared to be natural lighting but seemed to be duller than what would be expected. This brought out the element of drama and while being a typical dramatic effect, gave a real sense of mood in most of the film. Like most war films, a depressing mood is given off and with this type of lighting, it really made this feeling come true for me as a viewer. Character costume was also an important element in this film. Not only was there uniformity between officer and enlisted, you could also get a feeling for who was in the fight and who may have just arrived. Most men looked haggard and beaten down and without needing to look at their expression, you could understand this through their appearance. Men's uniforms were dirty or blood stained while men at a base would have what almost appeared as new fatigues as they had not left the safety of the base. These different elements added to the cinematic effect and helped in portraying such an exhilarating film.While some may describe this as just another war film, Spielberg, Hanks, and Tom Sizemore together made this a classic. War films generally follow the action and Saving Private Ryan turned the focus to courage rather than just victory. A must see film from an all-star cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was just a fantastic movie. That opening half an hour with the allied invasion of Normandy is like nothing I've ever seen before, unflinchingly gritty, violent, bloody, loud, horrific and brutal. I was actually watching it on the treadmill and had to stop because I was gasping and then sobbing. Probably one of the most realistic portrayals of the horrors of war ever made. This was in your face throughout and doesn't glorify or lie about combat.The movie itself I would have to say is a bit of a masterpiece with amazing attention to detail and Steven Spielberg deservingly winning an Oscar for his stunning war drama. The story follows a squad of US army soldiers on a mission to rescue a GI trapped behind enemy lines in France on D-day after all 3 of this brothers are killed in action.Excellent performances all round but especially from (Tom Hanks) as Capt. Miller leading his men on their perilous mission to locate that one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines. I also really enjoyed Tom Sizemore.This movie has so many familiar faces attached and it was interesting (and even fun) seeing all the different actors showing up along the way in the search for Ryan including Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Bryan Cranston, Dennis Farina, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Nathan Fillion, Paul Giamatti, Vin Diesel, Ryan Hurst. 11/11/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly this film will have many effects upon anyone who views this film, whether the effect will be negative or positive can not be certain. It may be of truth that anyone who views this movies will be altered in some way. But I shall give you a warning, many will find the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch.So, one of the great debates that seem to come from this film is justification of the extreme violence. And anyone one who spends their time watching this film should really consider the question; can Saving Private Ryan's portrayal of an important chapter in our history and darkest periods of history known to humanity, in its most startling, graphic depiction be considered a positive for this movie?Yes, I do agree with many that believe that Saving Private Ryan is a spirit wrenching, and soul disturbing realistic depiction of what those who have scarifies their very lives that have been given to them to faced humanities darkest moments. But is that really a reason for viewers to be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie's real life depictions of such dark times? This film truly shows us the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches and this is what many people use for their case to defend such a film. They believe that such portrayal adds more positive leverage towards the tone of seriousness of the subject matter before us. Saving Private Ryan may have a morality tale underscoring its horror of armed combats, but it accomplishes the very mission that it seeks brilliantly. It reveres the ultimate sacrifice made by young soldiers who paid with their lives for our freedom. It brings upon the viewer great respect. But in conclusion, No matter what this film brings to the table for us, I strongly believe that young children should never view these atrocities, these great horrors. There simply can be no justification for that type of audience. As for teens, parents must weigh the significant negatives?extreme violence at the forefront, and not to mention foul language and sensuality ?before letting youth or even themselves enter the battlefields of Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Matt Damon star in this War Epic directed by Steven Spielberg. The story follows a group of soldiers who are risking their lives to save "Private Ryan", whose 3 other brothers have been killed. Steven Spielberg doesn't cut any corners or hide the truth. As in the opening Normandy Landing Scene, he shows the brutality as it is. The Film really emphasizes the Horror of War, and how risking your life for another is an honorable and rewarding thing. Tom Hanks helps boost the film to a high, with a stunning and scarily realistic performance as Captain John Miller. The supporting cast, like Matt Damon, are also awesome and help the film reach its fullest potential.The film is truly one of, if not the best World War II films ever made, and will surely stay a gem in cinema now and into the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with almost everybody on this one: this is definitely a very good film. The first part is excellent and is almost certainly destined to become part of cinematic history. The original music score and the special effects are uniformly excellent and the cinematography very good.Having said all the above however, I did also find some faults (albeit small) hence the rating of (only) 8/10. Let's try to explore some briefly: I think the story was a bit lacking, slightly oversimplified. More in- depth characterization would have improved the movie in my opinion. Apart from this, I also think (and i am well aware that most will disagree with me here) that Tom Hanks was completely miscast here. To me (even though he is undoubtedly a great actor), he never even remotely resembles the tough, no-nonsense, war hero he is supposed to be playing. Just think of John Wayne in a very similar role in 'The Longest Day' and you will probably see what I mean.Havind said the above though, this is and remains an excellent film. Spielberg has done it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's actually pretty sad for me, as Russian, to accept that it's America that made the best movie about WWII, but not us. But eventually it doesn't even matter. The main thing is - they managed to present the most plausible film regarding this topic, the one which dispels the myth of war's romanticism and actually shows the horrible truth about the war - terrible death, blaring perishing fear, hopelessness, despair, inexpressible brutality. The landing scene, from my point of view, is the paragon of presenting a battle experience. Blood runs cold whilst watching that scene. Generally the whole movie is watched in one breath. Yeah, one could say that the plot is a bit flimsy, but it's perfectly compensated by incredible battle scenes. It is also impossible not to mention the amazing cast. The personalities of characters are unfolded spectacularly. If you're into war movies you'll probably dive into the story and live through it together with the squad. And this is exactly what really terrific about cinematography. So in this way, if you haven't watched this movie yet you should definitely do it ASAP. I bet it would be one of the most breathtaking film experience you've ever had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theme of sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Saving Private Ryan(Spielberg, 1998) follows a squad of soldiers led by Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks. The squad is sent on a risky mission to locate and return Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon. Ryan has lost multiple siblings in various theaters of WWII, thus earning him a ticket home. He is however lost somewhere in France following a messy D-Day assault. The theme focuses on the sacrifices made by brothers in arms and the idea of earning what was paid for in blood.Upon initially learning of the mission, the squad balks at the idea of risking an entire squad to save one man. As the squad proceeds with the mission, they convey through speech and actions that they hope to earn the right to return home, and grudgingly come to terms with the mission. However, a repeating motif in the film is that despite trying to apply the moral and ethical solution to a problem, the end result is often a large, unrewarding sacrifice. For example, Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo attempts to rescue and take with them a young girl at the request of her family. In the confusion and stress of the scene, a sniper shoots Caparzo. Additionally, when the squad later encounters a German machine gun bunker, the squad reluctantly decides to attack, hoping to prevent a future ambush. The end result is the death of the medic, Wade. Furthermore, a German soldier captured during the assault is released, and later kills Private Mellish in a different battle. Despite their willing sacrifice, the end result is often negative. This is in contrast to many other war films where sacrifice immediately pays off, such as Enemy at the Gates (Annaud, 2001), in which the sniper Vassili is able to locate an enemy sniper after his friend sacrifices himself by allowing the enemy to shoot him.Not only does the film do an excellent job of visually depicting the horrors of war, but it also uses a keen detail to sound to further the experience and elaborate on the fear and stress of a war time setting. From the pings of spent ammo clips to the realistic thuds of ricochets', the sound envelops the viewer. A particularly striking scene occurs after the squad has located Private Ryan, yet are compelled to stay and help a grossly undermanned and under gunned group of soldiers defend a vital bridge from approaching Germans. As the group waits in silence to ambush the approaching German armor, a low, screeching mechanical sound can be heard in the distance. The sound becomes increasingly loud and menacing as the Germans approach, and the viewer is filled with a sense of dread, reiterated by the facial emoting of the actors. It is clear by the sound they are dealing with a very powerful force, and do not have the means to make it a fair fight, yet they must stay and fight. This scene would have lost much of its power and influence without the dramatic build up from sounds effects.Ultimately, much of the squad is sacrificed and Captain Miller implores Private Ryan to earn this chance at life that he has been given, and live a good life. After a tremendous amount of sacrifice, a positive result finally comes to fruition. However, as indicated in the final scene, an aged Ryan is plagued by the burden of being a lucky survivor, and is in constant inner turmoil over whether or not he had earned what so many others had sacrificed for.Spielberg, S (Director), Rodat, R (Writer).

		<shortDescription>Solid, melodramatic war piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is certainly a good film, and a major technical achievement, but it is little more than that.After the stunning first twenty minutes the movie begins to falter. The storyline seems to be based in asking the question 'What is the value of one life?' The characters struggle with risking all of their own lives to save just one. Is duty and honor important enough to die for? What if Ryan turns out to be a complete degenerate? It is a pretty heady, and ultimately unanswerable question. Yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film, Spielberg answers the question for us. This is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings. It cheapens the film. When Hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama. When the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know he'll be dead in ten minutes. When they release the German soldier we somehow know we'll see him again. How many clichés and obvious plot devices can one throw into a 'realistic' movie? How about the celebrity cameos that feed a director's ego,but serve only to distract the audience from the film (Hey! Isn't that Ted Danson?) For the most part it is completely overblown, gratuitous melodrama. It isn't even the best war movie ever made, much less the best movie ever. It's worth the three hours, but not much more.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, i love spielbergs work and i love tom hanks and matt damon but this movie although beautifully shot and with some of the most intense action sequences ever portrayed in a movie i feel as though the characters lost me. They did not grip my interest i did not care of them as i normally do in a movie such as this. I felt myself not caring when characters were killed which really disappointed me. Spielberg tries to make you care for them by overly long scenes in which they talk about their past i however found these scenes boring and had didn't have me caring any more. This movie is about a squad in world war 2 that is sent to save a man who had lost all his 3 brothers in the war. Since he was the only son left in his family the government made a decision to send a group of men to go save the last remaining son (Damon) of course on the way they lose men and face trials of humanity.Even though what i said above i still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Its just that i have such high expectations from spielberg and hanks so in my opinion it was kind of a let down though i may be the only person on earth who thinks so. So by all means go watch this one friends</fullReview>

Therefore they must be evil, right? The whole idea collapsed like a house of cards at the end. Suddenly the Americans turned to heroes and the enemies turned to villains.

James Francis Ryan's life is truly inspirational. It is very realistic which at times simply becomes hard to bear. I like bears. Im sorry about this review because I have to write it for a class so i think ill just chug through my lines with random writing like tom hanks chugs through German after German while dodging bullets like Jacky Chan. This element makes the movie slightly unrealistic at times. It is also has some other neat elements like a bad-ass sniper and some kick ass scenes. This movie truly does show the gruesome affects that war has on soldiers in battle but not so much the aftermath and the symptoms of post dramatic stress. So what do you think is the best type of bear? I think the coolest ones are polar bears but they are certainly not the best.

After such a stunning start, the film suffers because it never again captures that intensity. The story is simple and shows the American soldiers as good honest men who fight because it's their duty. Hanks is fine in an understated role. Matt Damon is slightly bland. No one else leaves much of an impression.

		<shortDescription>History aside, "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the greatest propaganda films ever made and grittily epic visualizing at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have had this film's DVD for a few years now, I had never been intrigued by war films and always thought of them as preachy propaganda in one way or the other. But I happened to stumble across "Saving Private Ryan" as our class was doing a WWII project, and so decided to watch it. Although maybe it was preachy (somewhat) and yet still not extremely historically accurate (I should know, considering that I watched it for a history project), one thing that I could not deny with an open mind is that Saving Private Ryan is epic film-making at its finest.As far as the story is concerned, I won't go too deep into historical accuracy, but as long as the important things are set straight and the story makes sense on its own, I'm happy with it. That being said, there should have been more effort put into showing how other Allied nations besides America contributed to the war, at least during the beach landing sequence. This is my biggest gripe with the story, and even then it's a fairly minor gripe.Some more background on the war would have also helped a lot to lend that extra authenticity edge to the movie, but the lack of it doesn't come down hard at all since most of us know it anyways. Aside from that, the story is fairly straightforward, which is good, since most of it is packed with great, amazingly cinematographed action sequences, and even better, the high-impact action is nicely balanced out by a few tender moments ? making Saving Private Ryan more than just a war-themed action film.However, the whole mission of 'saving Private Ryan' ? for which our heroes risk their lives ? should've been justified more deeply, with more than just an Abraham Lincoln speech. And another thing that could've cleared up many misconceptions was the movie's name; Pvt. Ryan, despite being talked about throughout the movie, appears for like 15 minutes on screen, and even then has very little character development. Heck, the movie's tagline would've made for a more suitable title ("The Mission is A Man"). In fact, Pvt. Ryan is almost relegated to a minor character when it comes to screenplay, as the movie centers almost entirely around Tom Hanks' Capt. John Miller, who is also the most fleshed-out character in the movie ? perhaps the only one, in fact, but considering the movie's runtime, focusing on a few characters is a good thing.Like most others', my favorite scene from the movie was the Normandy beach landing at the beginning, which is one of the most intense sequences I've ever seen in a movie. If there is one vital thing that this scene would be incomplete without, it is the cinematography ? the shaky hand-held camera-work wonderfully evokes the feeling that the viewer is seeing the whole thing through the eyes of one of the soldiers fighting on the beach, and it leaves a very strong impression. There are also dramatic depictions of shell shock and tons of realistic hardcore gore, none of which feels gratuitous in context of the overall turbulence of the entire sequence. The sound is just as good, as gunshots and machine-gun fire booms loud and clear amidst frantic last cries, groans and screaming of soldiers.The cinematography, production design and acting are top-notch all across the board throughout the movie. Tom Hanks' performance is particularly moving and resonant. The cinematography is greatly helped by the 'handy-cam' style of camera-work and use of appropriately grayish color palettes. When it comes to the production design, destroyed villages and pastures look like they should, with dead rotting cows and all, while the piles of garbage that are found in abundance throughout the movie are also meticulously detailed, complete with chunks of 1940s-looking weaponry sticking out of them.All in all, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war propaganda films ever made, if not the best (and I mean it positively) ? but my dilemma was right, it is still a propaganda film because according to this movie all Nazis are one-dimensional, motiveless and spineless, but considering how good the movie already is with its current premise, I couldn't really ask for more. And besides, with a famously Jewish director, what else can you ask for? Regardless, Saving Private Ryan is without doubt among the finest movies in its dimension and in its genre. RATING: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough being a teenager now. You have to catch up on all types of movies. Classics, older movies, and newer movies you may have missed. When Saving Private Ryan opened in 1998, I, of course, wasn't allowed to see it, nor would I have been interested in seeing it. But now, everyone at school's buzzing about that movie, saying how great it is. I finally gave into peer pressure and rented it, and it's quite a good movie. It's just not the extraordinary classic that it's made out to be.The time is World War II. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to fetch the title character, hence saving him and making the title make sense. Why send out eight people to rescue just one private? His three brothers, who were also in the war, were killed, so basically eight men are sent out to ease Mrs. Ryan. Obviously, when they finally reach him, there is resentment.The movie opens with a flashback to the war, as every single war movie seems to do! Why is this always necessary? That means we know that some people survive, taking some tension out. At least we usually can't figure out who yet. Then it goes in with a bang, at a loud, exciting war scene that doesn't really have much to do with the rest of the plot, but it's very exciting. The only problem is that it pads out the movie to an obnoxiously long 170 minutes and since it isn't necessary, it didn't HAVE to be in the movie.While the movie is quite long, it's never boring, not at all, but some parts aren't very interesting. Also, since it's a Spielberg investment, every single character has to have a backstory, meaning that smack dab in the middle of the movie, everyone must reminisce about what their life was, even those whose names we don't know, meaning that right when it's getting good, it goes off to left field.The war scenes were incredibly realistic, as far as I can tell. Although graphic at times, it's obvious how painstakingly hard they worked to make it seem like you were actually there, no matter where you were, including watching it on a 5" screen. Also, I think something else that added to the realism is that Spielberg kept the camera to a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Therefore, he was centralizing in on the action, what needed to be shown, and what doesn't need to be shown.Saving Private Ryan ebbs and flows. At times there's heartpounding action, at others it's just watchable so you can continue on with the plot. But however you feel about this movie, you have to admit that it's one of the most realistic war films ever made.My rating: 7/10Rated R for war violence and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the few people in the world that had not seen this movie. Last night a friend of mine wanted me to see the beginning scene on his home theater. I heard so many people talk about the open scene that I was all for the experience in surround sound. I wasn't planning on watching the whole movie, but it was too late. This is one of many really long movies, but it flows so well and the storyline just sucks you in. I constantly kept thinking how would I feel if I was in one their shoes. I couldn't begin to comprehend how traumatic it would be to go through a war with all you would be involved in doing and the things you would see, you wish you didn't have to.This is a really good movie, which comes to no surprise when it is a Spielberg movie. This is a movie about bringing a Private James Ryan home after there is confirmation his 3 brothers were already killed in action. This movie shows great passion and there is lots of gore. This movie doesn't glorify war, but depicts it exactly how it is ... ugly. I would recommend that if you have not seen this, watch it. It is a long movie but it goes at an excellent pace. It is a touching movie with allot of graphic images. Allot of what you see in this movie will most likely disturb you. I just can't stress enough, this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about Hanks character with Pvt Ryan as an after though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks did a superb job in portraying the poor hapless fellow charged with "saving private Ryan." Only to be killed in the end. Many scenes of war fighting with all one expects, such as enemy snippers, machine gun nests and mine fields. The enemy soldier Hanks benevolently lets go in one such scene is one who helps to kill him in the end. Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon, only coming into play in the latter part of the movie, to me some what of an anticlimax, is insistent he doesn't want to be rescued, but chooses to fight to the end; of the movie that is. Admittedly this movie is about the character played by Hanks, with Damon as an after thought. The Pvt. Ryan character could of just as easily been played by a trained chimpanzee for what it added to the overall movie. While I liked the overall movie, I was noticeable disappointed by the Pvt. Ryan character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the sustained impact of the classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 minutes of this movie are indeed the most horrifying images of the reality of War.Although many viewers complain that the facts are not historically correct,this liberty can be accepted as a means of portraying the pure horror that is experienced on any battlefield, past or present.The impact of the confrontation with the destructive nature of man and his senseless killing however is spoiled to a degree by the ensuing story itself. The movie becomes a remake of so many other Hollywood war epics."Saving Private Ryan" had the potential of being an ode to all those soldiers who have given their lives for their country in often questionable circumstances.It certainly doesn't have the same impact as classics such as "Paths of Glory" which succeeded in portraying war as a cruel reality without the need of adding any fictitious elements to engage the viewer.</fullReview>

I couldn't eat or drink anything because the first half an hour of this movie was so intense, I was just staring with my mouth wide opened.Its a great idea to take a Movie completely from "first person view". This gets you practically into the Scene like you were one of the Soldiers. The hissing sounds of the Bullets, the quietness under water and the faces of the soldiers desperate and full of fear. Definitely no Rambo in this one.Call me a Sissy but you get at least a glimpse of what Hell War must be. Just the first half hour makes this one, one of the best anti-War movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough look at the horrors of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had put off watching this film because I'd heard it was so bloody and I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. Well, it lived up to its billing. The scenes of war look very realistic and it's a shocking experience to watch.I enjoyed the film, but not as much as Spielberg's other WWII film, "Schindler's List." I suppose it's because of the comparative lack of drama. Tom Hanks is a terrific actor but his character doesn't draw you in like Liam Neeson's did. I didn't relate to the people in "Saving Private Ryan" the way I did in "Schindler." It's probably not a fair comparison to make, but that was my reaction anyway.The premise bothered me a little bit too. Sure, saving the lone remaining child of a family is important, but did it make sense to send a company of men out during the days right after the landing at Normandy to save one person? Things were chaotic then and success wasn't assured by any means, and I think the military's focus would have been elsewhere. I don't know what the real circumstances were that the film was based on, but the director did make the mission seem worthy by having the men defend a vital bridge from the Germans after they caught up with Ryan. It's a complicated subject, war, and while this movie is very good, I'm not sure I agree with the focus of this film as a way of portraying patriotism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this flick, I had heard all the rumours about the beginning of this movie. I consider myself to have a strong stomach for silver-screen violence, so I thought to myself "what could Spielberg, "mr. Fairy-tale", of all people, shove on my face". Well, 30 minutes of unrelenting full-blooded grindhouse gore was NOT anything I could have prepared myself for! I don't think there's anyone in the world who can take the beginning of SPR easily. I bet even guys like Paul "I said more blood, you faggots!" Verhoeven ended up thinkin 'this sh*t is heavy!' You'll be stunned, you'll FEEL the horror and you'll end up watching helplessly as Spielberg and his team introduce you to the face of war! This is NOT entertainment with a bunch of grown-up kids cowboying it on the "Krauts", this is sadistic, mindless and brutal, just like the real thing. After the start things slow down just a little bit as the plot unravels, but Spielberg manages easily in staying miles away from his fairy-tale-telling alter ego. And in the end... well, here we go again. If this was a regular action flick, you'd be waiting for the big finale. This time you are so much rooting for the soldiers you hope they would get away without having to fight anymore. BUT, Steven keeps it real to the end and in the grand fnale, bombards the viewer emotionally to the ground! Only two minor complaints: close-up on the american flag (yea, yea, heroes,"land of the free" etc.) and some light moments at the end ('the last speech of the dying hero' - cliche...) taste a bit fake in this otherly very heavy movie. I also am not so sure if portraying Germans again as back-stabbing S.O.B.:s is that good a choice. And I hate Sizemore in this, but this gets payed back by the surprisingly good performance of Ed Burns.10- / 10</fullReview>

"das reich" they were blooded from eastern front campaigns and they would know alot about urban warfare and that unit wouldnt send a tiger and a assault gun down the middle of a town knowing very well the effects of urban warfare but i guess spielberg wanted some so-called "nazis" to be killed. there should be more movies like this one, especially about the unknown waffen-ss heroes who were just soldiers doing there duties as FRONT LINE SOLDIERS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Saving Private Ryan back in '98 when it was released in theaters. I remember sitting there almost in tears ten minutes into the movie! It does not feel like a movie at all. It feels like a war! The camera men and the sound crew deserve as much credit as Speilberg or Hanks for making the movie come to life. I say this is one of the best movies ever because almost every other war movie glorifies war and destruction whereas this movie would dissuade anyone from wanting to go to war. If you have not seen this, you have not seen a war movie yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers: I enjoyed the movie, but the idea of sending a group of soldiers to find one guy just so his mother will not lose her last surviving son is ridiculous to me. The soldiers should have fought in battle, not gone on a mission to bring one healthy soldier home. He was not a POW. He was not sick. They should have never thought about trying to find him to take him home. In the movie, soldiers died trying to find this guy or as an indirect result of the search, and I think it was a total waste. Greater value seemed to be placed on one soldier's life than another, and that's just not right. To those who believe this is a true story, understand that the search was fictional. It did not happen in real life. Aside from the fact that these guys were risking their lives to find one healthy soldier in this story, this was an interesting movie. I think it captured what the war must have been like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the best war films of all time. Doing justice to actual events of Omaha beach by accurately representing the landings of June 6th was the thing that clinched my liking of the film - despite it being the opening 20 minutes. So very many films stray from the truth in order to make the film more exciting and the visual effects more pronounced, which isn't a big problem to me, as long as it's tasteful. Further developments in the film also increased how much i enjoyed the film. Well filmed action sequences littered with plot development really keep the film going, however, after the first 2 or 3 times some of the characters can become dull [Pvt. Melish for example]. Typically good acting from Tom Hanks is complimented by good performances from Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and even Vin Diesel - in his best role to date. Overall a very good film, but don't over watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg kind of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning was shock. Bullets of enemy's machineguns tearing soldiersheads away while they are about to go enter Omaha Beach, the notoriousbeach for US soldiers. The cameraman really lived through all that, I thought. I have seen a quite a bit war films, but the chaotic, inhuman, and horror are not strong words enough to describe the beginning of the movie.Spielberg did a good work, I must say, what comes to describing the actual war, what it's like. Also, following his style, he steers clear from judging things. However, soon the movie lose it's tracks. Yet it seems to be historically accurate and it's interesting to watch as a historical epic story, the moral set of the movie starts to taste strange. Indeed. And the composition in the beginning when the old mr.Ryan is squatting on the graveyard, and folks are behind, that composition is VERY Spielberg.That's afterall the best thing in the movie, but also it's the thing what makes this movie feel like a bit unfinished. Also, the movie reminded me too much of"Green Mile" which was a kind of inmature description now that I think of it. That's the thing of Spielberg movies, they get everyone inside in the first sight, but soon they abandon the audience, leaving them wander helplessly intochaos of unclear and muddy world or moral questions. Kubrick's world is moreclear in that sense. Anyway, good movie, well worth of 8.</fullReview>

Obviously, there are people complaining about "sentimentality", "sickening pro-Americanism", etc. Well, for those people - I'm anything but a patriot, but I still loved this film - it is THE greatest war film ever, and the second best FILM ever.It's been said, but I will still say it: if you don't like this, fine - just DON'T BASH IT FOR BEING PRO-AMERICAN WHEN IT IS AN AMERICAN FILM! Stereotypes? Whatever - then there are plenty of '40s and '50s movies for you to make fun of, since they were so one-sided. This is a film about soldiers, NOT a crappy all-star extravaganza with big names top-billed for maybe twenty minutes of screen time and slow battle scenes - "Midway", "Tora! Tora! Tora!" (extremely overrated IMO), and "The Battle of the Bulge" - where half of the movie is the opposing generals planning the battle. Ah well.The plot is a bit hackneyed: eight crack US soldiers are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who has crashlanded behind enemy lines. The reason? Because all of his brothers have already been butchered, and the US Military (in the persona of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall [Harve Presnell]) decides for public relations reasons to save him. The soldiers, led by John Miller (Tom Hanks!), go through a war-scarred countryside, engaging in a skirmish or two along the way and seeing the ravages of war up close and personal.Sound corny?Well, it is: but the EXECUTION is perfect. Yes, the opening and closing scenes at the Normany Memorial could've been left out without making the film any worse - but they're a very small part of the experience.The battle scenes and the acting are great - even Vin Diesel, who after seeing the abomination that is "XXX" I now despise, is good (though he only has about fifteen minutes of screen time anyway). The opening D-Day fighting features some of the most graphic violence ever put on film, with "Dr. Strangelove"-esque cinematography. Let's just say, however, that after seeing "We Were Soldiers", "The Wild Bunch", "The Patriot", etc. before this, I was not shocked by the violence at all. Even the soldier who had his guts blown out did not disgust me - I thought it looked like foam spray. But it's still a graphic scene.One of the best scenes of the film is the attack on the radar station, for more than one reason. Seven of the US troops (Diesel's character was killed by a German sniper in a French town a while back) attack a small German force. The battle is not shown, really: instead, we see a brief firefight with no gore at all through the view of the green interpreter Corporal Upham (the superb Jeffrey Davies). Then one of the grunts, a Private Wade (Giovanni Rizzi), has been gut shot. In a heart-rendering scene, his comrades gather around him and attempt to stop the bleeding before he dies. Then, the Americans come across a German soldier (Joerg Sadler), who is forced to dig a grave for Wade. Upham pleads for the German's life, while Miller and his men want to execute him. The German utters token English phrases (such as "F*ck Hitler!") in an attempt to have himself spared. Miller, for whatever reason, decides to let him go.The best battle scene of all, however, is the final confrontation. Having finally found Ryan and several men of his patrol, Miller and his men decide to join them in the defense of a crucial bridgehead against what would prove to be a last-stand. This battle scene is graphic and moving - no realism is spared. The ending was predictably cop-out, but given how it played out, I didn't much care.Ten stars is an award that I give very few films - but Spielberg - arguably the greatest filmmaker working today - deserves it with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted a 1 for this movie. Not because I hated It but because I do not believe it deserves to be this high on the IMDB Top 250 (#47). At the Oscars in '99 many were surprised that this picture lost the best picture award. Well I was not. But I was very disappointed that Shakespeare in Love did! The best picture award should either have gone to Elizabeth or to La Vita É Bella. Those were the two best pictures of 1998 (at least the best ones that were nominated). I thought it would be "La Vita...". 'Ryan' just isn't THAT Good. I mean...I did believe that it would be the one with the second most awards because of technical awards like sound, sound editing, editing and cinematography which it all won. Those were the best aspects of the film. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN DESERVED THESE AWARDS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM THAT YEAR because they made the "NORMANDY" SEQUENCE a CLASSIC! That is also the only reason I felt that Steven Spielberg should have won the Best Director award. He and Benigi were the only one who created a classic scene and he won. Either him or Roberto Benigi deserved to win. The bad aspects (Tom Hanks and the Screenplay by Robert Rodat) however ARE BAD because they just don't work. It's not that he's a bad actor but he just does not fit the picture. Neither does Matt Damon by the way...and Ted Danson? What was he doing in there? (*SPOILER*)Anyway...at The Battle for the Bridge-sequence when Hanks is dying and he says the line; 'Earn this...Earn it...' coming out of the mouth of Hanks it just sounds so CORNY to me...He was a better actor playing a dying man in PHILADELPHIA. As for the Screenplay...there's nothing that really sparks interest so... Oh yeah another thing...John Williams score should not have even been nominated. There is just one good piece of music; The Hymn of the fallen. The rest is just like the REST of the movie. Dreary, boring and above all uninteresting. It fits the movie but a dreary, boring, uninteresting film is not what people want to see. It's NOT worth the nomination... That's all.</fullReview>

Indeed, there are many points in this film where one feels that it is less a 'powerful anti-war statement' and more a '1970s War Movie', The Dirty Dozen with highbrow pretensions.This is a terrible shame of course as the film has many virtues; combat is depicted in a defining cinematic fashion, and generally presents war as existing in a moral void where, after all, the participants are attempting to slaughter each other. Good manners seem like something of an irrelevance when the bullets begin to fly.Nonetheless, the film remains mired in the results its own incestuous matings with Clint Eastwood-Era cliche. Soldiers talk about their mothers in a church at night. Isolated and demoralised soldiers face down overwhelming odds. Soldiers improvise powerful weaponry from a everyday objects and some explosive. A charismatic, strong-but-silent soldier buys it in the last reel prompting many in the audience to pine "Oh... I liked him!"And such obviousness is, frankly, the least of the film's worries. In a pivotal (if practically sepia-tinted) scene Captain Dale Dye adds another silver-haired martial patriarch to his already extensive Cv of such characters, and expresses the view that sending a squad of men after one paratrooper because of his mother is simple foolishness, on a purely mathematical level if nothing else. His CO offers a devastating counter-argument which is... nonsensical, frankly.As the scene closes, the CO having read out a very admirable letter by Abraham Lincoln, he has not made the case for his proposed military venture. He hasn't made the case for anything, actually. In fact, if the letter has a message it is that young men die in war and tragically that's inevitable and the bereaved parents should be proud of their sacrifice. Even if one agrees with this sentiment it is still rather difficult to see how it supports the case for sending a squad to find Jimmy Ryan. Indeed, it would appear to run utterly counter to it! But presumably everybody - including the otherwise reliable Captain 'Calm Down Son' Dye - is too caught up in the moment to still be, you know, thinking or anything.Worst of all, the characterisation of the squad themselves is largely cardboard-cut-out. A group of very able young actors are all saddled here with underdeveloped characters, all of whom appear to have been freshly unearthed from a metaphorical toybox where these lead soldiers have presumably been languishing since 1977. Only the ironically-named Sergeant Horvath truly impresses, and that is as much because of the way in which Tom Sizemore masterfully transforms cliche into archetype. It is surely plain to all that had this film involved any lengthy sequences in a French or Italian town, the good Sergeant would have shacked up with the madam of the local whorehouse in a matter of minutes.This film is something of a Jekyll &amp; Hyde then - quite honestly it's far too exciting to be genuinely anti-war, and perversely far too glib and simplistic on the subject of heroism and sacrifice to be an effective memorial to those who gave their lives. It's a shame that Spielberg did not choose to make a film that was in one camp or the other rather than straddling both in this way. As a technical achievement this film should not be missed, but it should not be mistaken for more than it is - a glorified 1970s war movie. Any who truly doubt this should reflect that the makers of this film saw no moral complications in adapting it into a succesful series of computer games, in which war is once again an exciting and heroic game.</fullReview>

But none of those can mount up to the over riding facts that make this a good movie...how so you may ask? well let me explain it to you.the plot: this movie has a compeling and original plot based on the real WW2 story. It involves a stiring try to find a private James Ryan whose 3 other brothers have died in combat. ! WARNING: after this point there will be MILD SPOILERS and i STRONGLY RECOMEND YOU DO NOT GO ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE! They eventually find ryan and have a life or death choice to help him and his company or move on and let them die.The characters: this has a Semi-all star cast headed up by tom hanks. they all develop well in the course of this movie and those who do die are not lost in vain. they are constantly put to the test in thier task to find private Ryan.The gore: yes even the gore supports the movie. by not holding back on any gore spielburg was able to put you into the realism of war and bring you into the movie as if you to were fighting the germans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about a mother that has four sons and three of them die on the same day so there is a search team launched to find the last brother. This movie has a great plot. And it shows the horrors of war. This movie is mostly about the aftermath of war. For the first forty-five minutes or so the movie is all fighting and it is all very realistic. You can even see the bullets cutting thru the water. But after that it is about the struggle to get to someone to save there life and send them home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best war movie ever made? Please. Go watch Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Ran, Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, or any other film made by a director with a true understanding of artistry in film-making. Spielberg's sycophants make me sick.Saving Private Ryan is best when Spielberg sticks to what he is actually good at, to wit, action. I whole-heartedly admit that the two big battle scenes are breathtaking. However, two scenes do not a movie make. Everything else was duller than dull. No profound insight. Nothing but cookie cutter characters, cheesy dialogue, and mindless flag waving. If this film was the only source of knowledge about Americans that someone had, s/he would come away with the conclusion that Americans sure are a bunch of cornballs. But we can shoot people pretty adeptly, can't we?Spielberg, go back to making ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark and save the heavy stuff for real directors. That is all.6/10 (the two battle scenes warrant a 6)</fullReview>

Barry Pepper plays the sniper who does well enough to pull off the job but doesnt quite fit the role to convince me enough but i really liked him in this movie. Giovani Ribisi i feel does the best as the medic. Ribisi needs more exposure and he could win an Oscar one day. I cant find a movie which tops this one off. Enemy at the Gates, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, and even Full Metal Jacket just didnt quite capture my eye enough to convince me of the reality of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the literally breath taking opening sequence, which immediately became a standard which newer movies would only try to touch ("Gladiator") to the brilliant photography and sound, unprecedented cinematic achievements that Spielberg became very fond of (I think he used the ENR process in "Minority Report" as well) and the Oscar worthy performances of every single leading actor. So what exactly is missing, what possible thing makes "Saving Private Ryan" one of the best and not maybe the best war movie of all time. It's the final message. I though that just ending the movie with the elderly Ryan, comforted by the thought that he was indeed a good man who lived his life the best he could was just to trivial to be inserted in the movie. And of course Spielberg had to take a long final shot of the American flag, despite the fact that the movie was almost completely fictional when it came to the plot. But despite these flaws the movie is spectacular and is one of the best movies of 1998, falling in second place to "The Thin Red Line" which should have won every Oscar it was nominated for. But then again, loosing to "Shakespeare In Love" hurts every bit as much. A visual triumph. War never looked so real and brutal. 8/10</fullReview>

It made me realized what our forefathers faught for, just so that I may live free and in peace -a lesson I think a lot of young people don't take seriously. For this, I think that the script was cleverly written. If you seen this movie you would agree at how well the cinemetography and script captured bullets whizzing by, body parts getting blown to pieces, and the soldiers emotions. Not that I am into gore, but I think to have capture the realism this way was truly amazing. Finally, what better choice than Tom Hanks to play the led role; A versital actor that deserves the oscar ten times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, but could have been a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Private Ryan, I had high expectations, because Spielberg's last 2 wars films " Empire of the Sun and Schinders List " were amazing, so I couldn't wait to see Saving Private Ryan, and after seeing it, I was very impressed and pleased with what I saw, but I think it could have been much better. The ending of the film left me feeling dissapointed, because I thought the ending of the film was just too nice, and you probably think what the hell I am going on about, but the truth of the matter is that my Girlfriends Grandfather was at Normandy, and he told me that even though they triumphed over the Germans, it didn't make it easier to carry on because they were used to all the bloodshed and the tragedy of World War 2 is much worse than we all think because the whole situation was a complete tragedy of war, and once told me all about what happened amongst the madness I wasn't expecting the film to end the way it did, so I went out and actually researched a bit about what happened before seeing the film, and I just don't think that they covered it well enough for me to be totally satisfied. I would never say it was a bad film, I would just say that I think a bit more could have gone into the story. A good film all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic, But Not Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to contrast "Saving Private Ryan" with "Thin Red Line." Both came out in 1998, and both deal with WWII from the American perspective. Yet it would be difficult to find two more radically different films. Each has strong and weak points. "Saving Private Ryan's" strong point is its intense realism. Viewers who were used to the traditional WWII movies of the '40's or '50's, or even later WWII epics, were not prepared for the intense violence of this film. For the first time, we saw what sighted-in MG-42's and a line of Mausers can do to advancing troops. This was not gratuitous. It is important for us to remember that the Nazis did not simply fall over. The allies, including our own soldiers, had to fight very hard to beat them.Yet "Saving Private Ryan's" strength doesn't go nearly as deep as "Thin Red Line." SPR is at heart a sharpened version of all the WWII movies that came before. It is a very good war movie, but that's all it is. There is no deeper exploration of the characters or the nature of humanity. That's not a criticism, just an observation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was a very good war film, but not a scratch on the Great Escape. The film follows the story of Private James Francis Ryan, whose brothers have been killed during the war. We follow Captain John Miller and his team accross France looking for Ryan, who is to be returned home. Throughout the movie thee are many refernces the Easy Company and th 101st Airborn, on which Band of Brothers mini series was based.I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the action involved but mostly because of the strong cast. Tom Hanks' performance was superb.The Great Escape was definately the best war film I've ever seen, and is so much better than Ryan because of its superior cast, script and action. The first 15 mins of Ryan is extremely gory, which will entertain some people. Band Of Brothers is just as good as Saving Private Ryan, and there are countless similarities between the two.Overall, Saving Private Ryan was a very good film by Steven Spielberg, with excellent performances from the likes of Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Matt Damon. However, this does not make it the greatest war film ever made. For that, I believe, you should look at The Great Escape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)I cannot begin to say how much I loved this movie. Probably the most engrossing plot line of any war movie. I liked the story, especially at the end because the end really makes the film what it is, which is amazing. The entire point of the movie is summed up in one line: "Tell me I've lived a good life." Ryan wants to have lived a good life because almost a whole squad died to bring him home. This is the genius of the movie, because the mission is so deadly, just for saving one man.The end battle is brutally violent. One guy gets stabbed slowly through the heart, a couple are blown up, and just about everyone else gets shot. The few that are left at the end are in hysteria. This movie does an excellent job of proving just how insane war can be, because they sacrificed so many people just to save one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the theater and then recently borrowed a friend's DVD and checked it out again. I was still bothered by the beginning. (SPOILERS) We're taken into Hanks' "horror-of-it-all" shell-shocked world in the first few minutes, then they reach safety behind a berm, he grabs his radio man, sees that his face is missing and tosses him aside like yesterday's newspaper, and then tries to use a shot up radio. Some guy gets a ricochet in the helmet, is told how lucky he is, then gets watermeloned. Visual gags? This after watching guys get torn in half by the most enveloping surround-sound machine guns and shells to ever reach the big screen. It kind of made me wonder where the movie was going. A deafeningly fictional account of war showing us how horrible it is? Okay, great, I'm totally there, now am I supposed to laugh? Ha ha. I've been a War Channel junkie since watching Victory at Sea on PBS in my Garanimals, and if the Insomnia Channel's got Richard Burton giving em' the what-for or even Kojak piloting a Sherman I am totally there as well, but don't overwhelm me with awesome auditory and visual effects and then fail to effectively draw the line between serious and sarcastic determination. Okay, no problem, time to relax, tell us about yourselves. Wow, what an assault. Take your time filling us in on the plot. (The scene back on the rolling farmland with the mother and her four stars was IMO the best scene in the movie.) Okay, so you're not going to blow up a dam or smoke cigars in the Eagle's Nest, that's fine, so the rest of the movie is a nitpicker, because it all looks great, but if you sense the fatalism and the mission is not to outwit the enemy toward victory (! ...Winston rules), then the vignettes on the way to your fate are all you have. The countryside and all kept me going nearly three hours in the theater, but zipping around with the DVD...okay, gripes on the vignettes...that sniper tower was not 450 yards away...three civilians left in the village, all hanging out out on the recently remodeled second floor veranda...if a wall falls down and the enemy is pointing guns at you, you open fire immediately (they would)...hey guys, keep your head(s) down, or at least show us somebody representing a sentinel, especially in a scene in which we're not sure if you've taken out that position...that half-track didn't see you?...a couple of sparkling "tankbusters!" straight from the Reno Air Races do a fly-over and it's surrender-monkey time?

		<shortDescription>Awesome war-recreation, sentimental stereotype dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in two minds about this one, folks...The opening is magnificent, possibly the greatest achievement in US film history to this date. The reality of these sequences are breathtaking, and Spielberg (along with his cast and crew) should get enormous credit for it. As a whole, however, this one is a disappointment.In spite of the marvellous work of recapturing the stress and anguish of the common soldier of a major modern military conflict, I would say that Spielberg and his script-writer spoils most of it by creating a line of clichés, both when it comes to the characters involved and the dialogue between them. In my opinion, there is no place in a feature like this one for the kind of conversations the characters get involved in. I'm thinking here mainly of the pathetic attempts to turn everyone of the main characters into noble heroes, and do it just in time before the great German assault. Which brings me to another point of complaint: the portrayal and behaviour of the German soldiers. They are (with a single exception) anonymous characters whos only role in this film is to get gunned down by the invincible (well, I'm overstating this in order to prove a point, but you'll (hopefully) get the idea) American troopers. I'm the first to admit that the combat scenes are formidably done, set with an accute sense of reality to them that's rare in WWII related films. Nevertheless, Spielberg falls into another pitfall by portraying his single German identifiable soldier as a traitor, both to his own countrymen and his American captors. This is all in the spirit of the classical dehumanisation of the Germans in Hollywood WWII-productions. They're usually in any feature just to be used as extras, mowed down in the pursuit of freedom. I feel that a greater depth is lost when these stereotypes are repoduced yet again in a feature that promised to be (and perhaps still is) a classic. In spite of these reservations, I would like to congratulate Mr. Spielberg and his cast and crew on a great achievement, only sligthly tarnished by the points I've mentioned above.</fullReview>

The allied assault on Normandy was amazing and close to reality (I believe), making it the most remembered scene in the movie (and best).But then the plot sinks in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Yes, sending 8 soldiers to rescue 1 just because his brothers are dead does seem unlikely and I wouldn't risk the lives of a capable platoon for only one soul.And making that chickenheart corporal Upham's mind change fast enough to make him shoot an unarmed man at point blank does nothing good to this movie.Overrated; The Thin Red Line and Black Hawk Down are much better. It's not bad, really, but I just can't figure out what the hell is so goo about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to argue Spielberg can't shoot a beautiful picture. Rarely, if ever, has a film so accurately portrayed the horrific consequences of war.That said, despite excellent acting jobs by the cast, the film suffers from a frequent Spielberg curse - that of the oh-so-obvious moral theme and the dreaded "bookends".The scenes of the old man weeping at the end of the film, in my mind, ruins its message. Clearly, after the scene on the bridge where Miller (Hanks) tells Ryan (Damon), "earn this", we can see all of the evils and horrors this man has absorbed and will carry for the rest of his life. It is unnecessary to see the older Ryan, fifty years later, having proved he took his captain's words to heart.Ultimately, it's still a great film - and one that's worth seeing, if not for all of the actors, who were somewhat unknown at the time.It is not, however, worth seeing Ted Danson in any way, shape, or form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins with an undescribably tough scene of the Americans D day. It lasts for over 20 overwhelming, breathtaking, bloody minutes, and gets you sink into the movie, but after it there are several life buoys that might get you out, unless you have your mind shortly inundated.First of all, there's way too much USA-glorification. The portrayal of the german soldiers as inhumane also accentuates this (The Germans WERE the enemy, there's no doubt about it, but still there's a difference between the war soldiers and the Nazi monsters). I understand that fact that the movie is shown from the (American) squad's point of view, and they suppose to be the heros of it, but I think it's exaggerated. To create empathy with the (indeed lovable) GI squad is one thing, but to make them the mighty American men who saved the world - is something entirely different, because in addition to its GREAT incorrectness (I won't detail) it causes disfavor in almost every non-American spectator. And I AM NOT anti-US, but I did feel this very intensely.However, overall it's a powerful movie. If you ignore this whole American patriotism thing, you get an affecting story, that shows the human tenderness of the soldiers, and reveals the dehumanization and the atrocity of war. Being a part of the Israeli nation, that had been through so many wars (and sometimes the shadow of it still hovers above our heads), it was very important for me to actually realize what my former generations experienced. During almost every minute of it I felt like I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. You just can't cry in this movie... I guess the soldiers felt exactly the same way.I loved Tom Hanks' character (although I don't think it's his best). His Captain Miller was rational, faithful, both tough and vulnerable... Those riveting scenes of him getting deaf, or his hand, or his introversion when it comes to his family... But to call him "mysterious" wouldn't be right. He's maybe the only character you really get to know, as weird as it sounds, and that is another flaw. I think the characters should have been developed more, because I didn't really get to know them, and therefore didn't really care for them... the only identification I felt with them is about the situation they were in, I cared for them as a group, but not individually, and that's a pity.Although the movie is long, it passed very quickly. I think the cinematography (the shooting) is OUTSTANDING, and with the sound and the special effects it contributes to the ambiance, and makes a great influence. Even when you watch it on a little screen... like I did... God, I wish I had watched it in the theatre!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg showcases his genious again. After taking us back to WWII in Schindler's List and showing us the horrors of the holocaust, Private Ryan brings us to the horrors of the front lines! The first 30 minutes of the film is uncompramising! The film does not let up as it shows us the brutalities of war, and in my view, the greatest war scenes EVER!This is my all time favourite film, along with The Silence of the Lambs! I have had relatives fight in WWII, and this film just gave me added respect for what they did for me.......all of us for that matter! There is one scene that matches the power of all the war scenes, I'm sure you'll know what scene I am speaking of! It has no fighting, no bombs, no blood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that saving private ryan was a really good film and it should have won the best picture oscar. But one thing gets on my nerves with Hollywood world war 2 movies.For people who didnt know BRITAN AND FRANCE WERE ALSO IN THE WAR AND WON THE WAR AGAINST GERMANY WITH AMERICA! America did not do it all alone as many brits and french soldiers died on the Normandy beaches along with the Americans. Same as U-571, as the British also got the code machines. Plus i just want to say this now- all British people dont speak with a nice posh accent, in fact about 90% of the population don't! I just want to see a Hollywood picture with a normal Englishman, not a stupid posh one oh and I would also like to actually see some Englishmen in World War movies.Anyway, back to the movie, it is very good. I've actually been to those places were they are set and I believed that they were actually filmed there! Acting was superb and as in all Speilberg's films the directing was top notch.So it was good film but would have been better if the English were credited with the beach invation because my Grandad did it and I don't see any record on this film (visually) about the risks that the Brits took as well as the Americans.Overall 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason this film is so successful is that it sidesteps the corniness which can go hand in hand with so many war movies. The characters are tantalisingly out of reach. Yes, you find out snippets. One of the troop's recollection of his mother coming home from work, and an anecdote about Ryan's brothers. But what makes this film special is the way that when Ryan asks Captain Miller to elaborate on his wife, Miller simply said that some things are for him alone. The fact that their lives back home are only occasionally hinted at actually gives the band of soldiers incredible dimension. I do not need to celebrate the awesome battle scenes or the moment when Edith Piaf sings out of the deserted town before the battle. Others have done that. Simply be prepared for an unforgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spielberg Touch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPR is really two movies, the one gutsy and innovative, the other improbable and in need of much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. The first twenty minutes of SPR deal with the realities of the landing on Normandy Beach, by the elite US Army Rangers. This is the movie with the level of gore and computer pyrotechnics that Hollywood, as part WWII war propaganda machine was totally unwilling, let alone incapable of showing. This was what was missing from a half century of war movies. The gruesome nature of true combat, the psychological effect on even trained soldiers are impeccably portrayed. On the other hand, after the landing has been achieved, we're thrown into a platoon of Rangers who are saddled with the unlikely task of locating a trooper (private Ryan) because all his brothers have already been killed. Although the movie now and then returns to it's war movie roots, the premise is so unlikely as to lose the viewer. Certainly the second half isn't living up to the first.Still recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie in a theater (I have since purchased the video). The depiction of the landing on Omaha Beach was easily the most intense movie experience I have ever had. The battle in the town near the end of the movie is probably the second most intense.When the movie ended, there was total and complete silence in the theater. It lasted for maybe a minute. Then I could make out the sounds of patrons gently getting up out of their seats. Next I could hear the soft footsteps as the people began to slowly walk out of the theater. And I could barely discern people near me talking in low and seemingly reverent tones. It was like everyone in the theater felt that they were in the presence of an awesome power that demanded, and deserved, the utmost respect. Never have I come close to an experience like that. It was as impressive as the movie itself.Steven Spielberg is a true genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best films I have ever seen. The direction by Steven Spielberg for this film is absolutely brilliant and the performances by every essential cast member are breathtaking and unforgettable. Spielberg graphically shows the harsh realities of war and the brotherhood of every soldier involved. Tom Hank's performance in this film is a work of art, a brilliant performance by a brilliant actor. The screenplay is successfully written and provides a hell of a story. It is because of these key elements that the film is brilliant. It is truly one of Spielberg's best works. However, the only thing wrong with this film are the occasional hilarities of the film. They sometimes drag off the importance of this story and what the director hopes to achieve from this. Other than that, the film is one of the best films ever made and should have won the Best Picture of 1998.</fullReview>

The story is kind of ho hum. I think this file would have been better if it were structured differently. I think starting off so strong only made it more difficult to keep the audience interested in it's characters and story. I think the intent was to grip the audience in the beginning, and that they'd have no choice but to be involved in the story. I didn't find this to be the case. I would give this a 11 out of 10 for the first 30 minutes (it really is the most gut wrenching thing I've ever seen on film) and a 7 out of 10 for the rest of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg was robbed! Spielberg was robbed! This was the rallying cry of the 1998 Oscars as "Shakespeare in Love" went on to win Best Picture in place of this dark portrayl of D-Day and the days following. This, however, is not my opinion. The FILM itself was robbed of appropriate actors, a strong script, and a good ending.However, before ripping "Ryan" to shreds, let first tell you the good. The first scene is horrifyingly good. The stark, real, unedited scene truly shows you the horrors of war. Furthermore, it is mixed in with the artistic craftsmanship of Steven Spielberg (pay attention to the part where bullets pierce the underwater environment.)Now, on to the bad. Tom Hanks, great as he may be, was not a smart choice for the leading role. He is so gentle in the role that you expect him to put the word "please" after every line. Second, Matt Damon, as the dreadfully forgettable Ryan. The last scene, which is drawn out, long, and at times boring. And finally, the final scene, which defies the meaning of corny by ending with an American flag flapping in the wind.Saving Private Ryan is a good movie, not a great one. This situation would be best described as "its parts are better than the whole." Particularly, the first scene. So, see it for what it is, and please resist the temptation to shout "Cool!" This is a war movie, not Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the first 15 minutes, where the near disaster on Omaha beach is effectively portrayed, the rest of the film is a standard John Wayne, 'Sands of Iwo Jima" type propaganda film made up of the most mundane and unbelievable tripe. If the truth be told, the American forces at Omaha would have been pushed back into the sea except for the British and Canadian forces immediately on their left flank who achieved ALL their objectives that day and pinned down the bulk of the Germans forces within their HQ area centred in Caen and thus prevented them from swinging south and completely obliterating the Omaha beachhead. Aside from that historical fact (not referred to in the film), the movie had other major shortcomings, ie; - no combat commander in his right mind would risk the lives of a full patrol to rescue a single, "Private Ryan", no matter what the reason; - no platoon leader (played by Tom Hanks) would go into combat with his officer stripes shining brightly on his helmet. To do so would invite an immediate sniper bullet from Germans who specifically targeted officers for priority elimination. - no platoon leader would insist on attacking an enemy strongpoint unnecessarily - especially since his orders were to only to "get Private Ryan". He could have detoured around the strong point but instead chose to attack it and lose some of his valuable platoon members. Why? - Tom Hanks and his heroic defence of the French town which climaxed the film was frankly unbelievable. The Germans may have been the enemy, but they were not stupid. In real life, Hanks and his little patrol would have surrendered or been brushed aside within seconds by a determined German force backed by tanks. When, oh when, are the Americans going to produce a realistic war movie which truthfully captures the events, flavour and outcome of combat reality without the John Wayne histrionics?</fullReview>

During the dramatic sequences of the Normandy battle, I thought he was attempting to show the horror and absurdity of war. But he chooses to dehumanize the German soldiers. More, you should not spare the life of one (even a unarmed prisoner), because that ungrateful coward will comeback to kill you and all your journeymen with pleasure.I guess it would be to difficult for Spielberg to show that the horrors of the holocaust and of the war were not perpetrated by a different species contained in a certain time, but by men like every others, and under certain conditions these could be reproduced anywhere else.Why not make a film that makes us realize (even the Jewish), that we could be (are?) those monsters, so history does not repeat itself. Instead we have another one about courage under fire... And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</fullReview>

I haven't always liked Spielberg's movies, but when I saw this I was sold. It has quickly become my favorite movie and contributed to my fascination with the history of World War II, and with D-Day and the campaign in Europe particularly. From the opening credits it brings you right into the invasion at Omaha Beach within a few minutes. This scene is an unforgettably realistic portrayal of one of the most important days of this century. It is a true crime that this picture did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture. I own it on DVD and have watched it over 20 times. I can hardly wait for the HBO mini-series "Band of Brothers" based on the Stephan Ambrose book.</fullReview>

This is a film that only certain Americans may like. There are English viewers way too full of their "God Save The Queen" attitude to actually give it a chance. Europeans, Canadians, and Australians might act as ignorant as the English and bombard this masterpiece with their racist criticism. This is only a film for the open-minded and warm-hearted American viewer. Since other countries hate to see our flag waving, it would be best if the film remained watched by only American audiences.

		<shortDescription>A comment on comments regarding combat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the movie..and read the comments. A few minor points. To the response regarding the unreality of the "kissing the crucifixes" et. al., as a former Marine infantry rifleman (in Vietnam)about 2/3's of my comrades, and I, carried everything from St Christopher medals to Stars of David..and we DID kiss them, hold them and talk to them. That isn't unrealistic or hypocritical..it's fact. And WWII had a more religious cadre than Vietnam. To the response on how bad the cinematography was, how boring the non combat scenes were, and how grotesquely horrific the combat scenes were; Spielberg was trying his best to show reality. He succeeded. The cinematography wasn't bad..June, 1944 was a miserably cold rainy month..it LOOKED dreary because it was! Periods between combat ARE boring..stupifyingly so. Combat is horrific...the only way Mr. Spielberg could have made it more realistic would have been to pour blood, excrement and puke into the theatres and occasionally step up behind a viewer and whack him across the back of the head when a shell exploded nearby. That's reality people. Good cinematography gives us reality. The comment regarding the ordinariness of the participants..well that is what makes them heroes. WWII was not fought by supermen..it was fought by normal people. Admiral Halsey once commented "There are no great men...there are only extraordinary challenges that ordinary men are forced by circumstance to overcome." Finally, in regard to the complaint that the story was absurd. It wasn't. After the five Sullivan brothers all died aboard the USS Juneau, brothers were routinely separated to avoid precisely this kind of occurrence. That is historical fact. There was a set of brothers involved in Normandy. One died with the 4th Infantry on Utah Beach, one with the 82nd Airborne, one was missing in Burma, and one (presumably the "Pvt. Ryan") was missing with the 101st. The one in Burma and the one with the 101st eventually turned up safe, bless them. But the situation was NOT unheard of. And the generals were not being overly gentle (although contrary to current opinion, WWII generals weren't monsters and could be gentle), they were trying to avoid/prevent what could have been a horrible morale blow to the American people. One set of Sullivan's can be inspiring, two sets can be terribly depressing. It was a legitimate action.I was wounded twice in Vietnam. I fought and killed. Saving Private Ryan is a truthful movie. The violence is real as opposed to gratuitous. The horror is real, and it's very mundane quality is what made it horrific. The premise is neither ridiculous nor evil. (Read about how Joe Kennedy was killed, and the military theory behind THAT mission ...then come back and explain about absurd theories in war being made up.) It is a great movie..A Schindler's List for the infantryman. By the way..the German's weren't protrayed as that bad. They fought and died just as the American's did. Consider the first battle scene, the American's on the attack and getting pounded. Then consider the last battle scene, the German's on the attack and getting pounded. Attacking isn't easy, nor fun..the odds are with the defense. Not evil...just fact. And regarding the German who was released and then eventually shot Hank's character; from that range and in that situation, it is doubtful he even knew who he was shooting. There was no evil intent. Just bad luck. Another truth about combat. Enough. Thank you for the chance to comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often hailed as one of the greatest war movies of all time, I have to wonder if I saw the same movie as all those other folks. Don't get me wrong there is no arguing that the opening scenes of the Americans storming the beach at Normandy are graphic and thanks to modern technology all too realistic, but these scenes are pretty much where the "war" movie ends, and the melodrama begins. For a movie about WWII the film lacks giving any information about the war, why the soldiers are there or any other facts in regards to what occurred in Normandy or elsewhere during the war. What ensues is a very pathetic character study of a group of entirely uninteresting individuals. While some performances stand out there is not much to work with, the script is such a gloss Hollywood piece of work, but then anything about the war seems to be one of the best films! these days. For those who argue this is one of the best war-anti-war films ever take another look at Catch-22 or better yet Dr. Strangelove, or even Slaughterhouse-Five, great depictions of the horrors of war and the toll that battle can take on people. I give Saving Private Ryan a whole 3 stars out of 5 - mainly because of graphic elements and believable combat scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm happy that movies can be made to look like the real world. Old warmovies had very poor action flics, BUT! But they had a story! Remember The Battle of the Bulge? Real suspense, makes you watch and be excited for the whole two hours. What does this film have? It makes you go pale and/or throw up after the first few minutes. You swear not to touch a rifle in your life. And after 30 minutes extreme nothing. No story, no dialogues, no acting. Yes, extremely poor acting. The whole movie is like a bad TV show: Disturbing Action Flics, Nothing But Blood and Guts. Sure, it is a great success to make a movie that can give you a very realistic feeling of war, but picture this: I've read a book written by a doctor about the siege of Budapest in WWII. That book had bigger effect on me than this poor movie. Just text. It takes more than a few flying limbs to make a movie! Next time if Steven Spielberg directs a movie showing exploding barrels for two hours, will it be nominated for best movie/book/whatsoever???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Opening--Overall Pedestrian Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of this movie is one of the best battle scenes I've witnessed in 50 years of movie viewing. So many appropriate superlatives about this scene have already been written by other reviewers that I can't add anything more.Unfortunately, once this scene is over the movie becomes a rather pedestrian WWII movie--just too predictable and, at times, stretching one's willingness to "suspend disbelief" to the ultimate and beyond. It's worth watching, but the bulk of the movie is just a rehash of cliches from just about every WWII film made in the 1940's and '50's.Opening scene rates a 10; the rest of the movie a 4; average 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I sat with my eyes wide open. It have perfect soundeffects, good acting. I cant mention an only negative thing about this movie. I have seen many warmovies in the last years, and I have never seen a warmovie thats's this good. This must be one of the best movies to Steven Spielberg, since E.T. The movie got a great story about some people that get a mission to save private Ryan in World War 2. After the invasion in Normandie they get their mission from some high rank generals. It is full of action through the hole movie. It wont be a minute where your bored. It is good from the beginning to the end. If you havent seen it, you should! Not seeing this movie is a big mestake. Take my advice and see this huge movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a memorable war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out with one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen on the big screen. The viewer is taken right down to the front line of soldiers of the D-day invasion of Normandy in 1944. The camera transfers the fear and helplessness of a war directly to the audience. It was really a really strong scene, nearly painful and a must-see.Thus, Saving Private Ryan starts out as one of the greatest war movies ever. However, the exaggerated American patriotism and superiority, mixed with typical Hollywood production soon makes this film just another film about the heroic American G.I:s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many just don't get it. This is an Anti-War Movie. The plot concerns a group of men sent to do something kind of pointless and futile in one of the most necessary and important wars of the last 2000 years. This plot is based partially on a true story, however, the true story happened during the civil war, not during World War II.For a wide variety of critics of this movie a copy of "T2" and "Matrix" would be all they need to keep them cinematically happy for the rest of their lives. Do not, I repeat DO NOT go to see this movie or some "action-adventure." Go rent "Raiders of the lost ark" or some other worn-out mind-numbing eye-candy movie.This movie is really different. It is arguably that ONLY war movie in HISTORY that is 100% realistic, all the way down to the pacing of the war iteself. War consists of periods of ferocious fighting and abject terror book-ending long periods of introspection and fear. The closest thing to this movie is "All Quiet on the Western Front."The musical theme for this movie is also superb - it can be compared to the outstanding theme for "Patton". However, the tone and emphasis of the movie and the music are the polar opposite of that of "Patton". </fullReview>

There's a bloody battle (too bloody for me here; despite all the hoopla, suggestion is often more powerful than "realism"), there's a gold star mother, there's an Italian, there's a Jew, there's a kid from Brooklyn, there's the nerd, there's the officer with a heart of gold, there's the all-knowing top sarge,...

Apparently, Tom Hanks is STILL the conversative white all american hero (he hasn't played any other role in years, which tells you something about his self image, politics, and ego), the Americans were the only people involved in World War II, and all american values are the best thing to fight for. They ALMOST covered the humanity of the germans...but no. They almost mentioned other countries... but no.They ALMOST gave a treatment of war worthy of the first 20 minutes... oh hang on. No they didn't. They sunk into sentimentalism, flag waving, and Tom being a hero at the price of the story and quality. Insulting to the memory of WWII vets from around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most outstanding movies every made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is perhaps director Steven Spielberg's greatest works. It illustrates clearly the stark reality of war, using graphic images that previously have not been seen in more traditional movies of this genre. Visually, it is stunning yet disturbing at the same time however the shocking images displayed only further re-iterate the brutality of war. The comradery between the soldiers in the film is strong, and probably a pretty accurate account of the importance of brotherhood during times of war. All alone in a foreign country with little more than a backpack and a rifle to call their own, each man is dependent on his peers to carry him through and keep him going through such difficult times.If you have a weak stomach or prefer the glossed over unrealistic version of life, then Saving Private Ryan is not the movie for you - you should stick to cheerier films like The Sound of Music or romantic comedies. The movie evokes a range of emotions in the viewer, from laughter to sadness and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history, particularly war and to those looking for a good, well-shot classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is certainly not the best war film ever made, but one of the much better ones. An amazing look at a platoon during World War II that is assigned to recover Private James Ryan due to the loss of his three older brothers. The opening scene with the older Ryan visiting Arlington Cemetery is very emotional as are several parts in the film. The D-Day sequence is one of the best war scenes ever in a movie and despite a few flaws in some of the characters, the cast is good. Steven Spielberg's direction is fantastic as always and the cinematography is outstanding. I dislike several of the reviews claiming the movie to be bad or untruthful. People need to look at it as a great film which shows us an important piece of history, truthful for the most part. A well-made, well-executed war film that is my candidate for best picture of 1998.Won 5 Oscars including Best Director and Best Cinematography.****/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much-vaunted realism seems to be missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan was promoted as a terrifyingly realistic war movie, and it is on this count that it fails. Despite numerous historical and military inaccuracies, some of the most important parts of the plot have gaping holes. A great scene is made of the argument over whether to shoot the captured German soldier, with the argument almost splitting up the squad. The indiscipline of the Rangers defies belief; as Spielberg is no doubt unaware, Rangers volunteer twice before they qualify; for Airborne training and again for Ranger training. Such volunteers have never been known to row like privates straight out of Basic training. Also, the way Tom Hanks' character moves his squad behind enemy lines is unbelievable; the whole squad walks in a close line, weapons on their shoulders, chatting away happily. Central Europeans are fortunate in that real American troops did not behave like this.Spielberg's movie is a brave attempt at showing the war from a soldier's perspective, but he made so many errors that apart from the landing scene, the movie is unwatchable for anyone versed in military matters. Also, not being American, I was disgusted by Spielberg's portrayal of German soldiers, who were all ragged, thin and gaunt. He also passes over the numerous war crimes U.S. soldiers perpetrate on screen with indifference.Better luck next time; the Thin Red Line was a much better attempt.</fullReview>

Although every critic in the world will praise the cast for superbly acted performances, you really have to congratulate the crew on an outstanding contribution to the movie. The sets look incredible, the sound is amazing and the camera-work is second to none. Tom Hanks seals in concrete his position as the greatest American actor of all time with another beautiful performance. However, the highest praise of all has to fall to Steven Spielberg. He is, without a doubt, the Beatles of cinema. And, if "Schindler's List" was his "Revolver", then "Saving Private Ryan" is his "SGT. Peppers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply, the most visceral movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say about this movie is that it blows away any other war movie. It is accessibly to anyone who watches it, from a high-school drop out factory worker to some rich guy with a doctorate in film studies, it leaves you with an impression that only a movie could deliver: "This is what it was like."Some pople may not know this, but the plot of the movie is based on an extraction of what almost happened. One single mother sent her four sons into the war, and, on one day, recieved death notices for three of them (two died on D-Day, one was lost and presumed killed in the Pacific theatre, though he was actually captured and returned at the end of the war). The U.S. Army sent the last son home for the same reasons as in the movie. Fortunately, in reality, a chaplain found the homeward-bound GI very quickly. The movie asks, what would have happened had he not been so accessible?Watching this film, it really gives you more an idea of what the war was like. I'm a history major, and my focus is on the Second World War; I've read at many dozens of books on the war, and written more than a few essays, including several on D-Day itself. Still, nothing brought me closer to a visceral understanding than this movie. Everything is so real, from the opening sequence, to the more subtle body of the movie (the two times city-fighting in the French town are amazing). It does not rely on any pansy artistic nonsense in the directing to make its point (as the far inferior "Thing Red Line" does), it simply presents the reality.To address some of the complaints of the movie:The lack of other nationalities is understandable. Normandy was divided into five zones, two of them were American, it is in one of those two that the story takes place. Simple. Also, the man the story is based on was American, so that's were he is in the movie. And, to be honest, the American landings on Utah and Omaha beaches were more exciting than the Canadian one of Juno beach and the British ones on Gold and Sword beaches. This was true because the Commonwealth armies were competent; the Americans messed up by over-planning their landings and by declining to engage in pre-landing naval and aerial bombardment.I've heard some complaints about the GI's comments on British General Montgomery, but those comments were true to what the American troops believed. Further, Montgomery, like most Allied commanders was no great shakes. Its like that in almost every field in the war. Rommel was better than Patton and Montgomery combined, Isoroku Yamamoto was ten times the admiral (and the man) Chester Nimits was, and so on. Face facts.To close up here: That this film lost the Oscar to Shakespeare in Love is almost criminal. There can be no comparing the two films.See this movie, if you already haven't.**Spoilers**: The most profound part of the movie, comes with a single line. As he's dying, Tom Hank's character says to the man six men died to save, Matt Damon's character, "Earn this." The look in Damon's eyes (easily his best moment as an actor) brought a tear to my eye as the screen faded into an aged version of the same character fifty-plus years later. To live be told when you're a teenager that six people died to save you, and have to somehow live a good enough life to earn it...wow! I can hardly imagine that sort of pressure. Very intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was late into the theatre, and entered right when all the bloody stuff was happening. The woman behind me gasped every time blood was shed (like every.9876 of a second). I sat there for three hours (close enough, anyway) without even knowing it.Spielberg had done it again. And he got his richly deserved Oscar for Best Director (the fact that Best Picture eluded them was a cheap move on the part of the Academy). Most war movies paint the enemy in a way that makes them really easy to hate, ending up as a fascist, pseudo-propagandic piece. But this wasn't. They weren't on a mission for war secrets, or to assassinate a Nazi general, but to get this ONE guy out of the madness. There's Captain Miller, with a Yossarian-like attempt to escape the madness, his relentlessly cheerful staff, the roadblocks and obstacles, and finally, Ryan, who they'd not expected. It didn't focus on the evils of the war, showing only the soldiers and not the kind of anti-whatsit speeches about their enemies, and it didn't promote the greatness of American power, despite all the patriotic music. Except, maybe, when you see the star-spangled banner at the beginning and so on, but otherwise, it was pretty neutral politically.At any rate, it deserves its place among the 200 best films of all time (according ot IMDB), and all the blood and guts and gore somehow wasn't brutal or sadistic, but merely showing it as it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was simply stunned when I saw Saving Private Ryan back in Fall 1998. I had very low expectations because the movie title sounded flat, director was Spielberg, who had not directed any "grunt-level" war movies so far. Also, Tom Hanks was starring it-I regarded him unsuitable to the role, despite being versatile actor. But these thoughts quickly vanished from my mind as landing crafts hit the beach and German MGs began peppering the shoreline. I began to feel almost as uncomfortable as the US troops pinned on the beach, everything was chaotic, tracer bullets whistling in the air, limbs blown off by mortar shells, men dying and screaming in agony, waves colored red with blood... Everything in these first 20 minutes or so was done in amazing detail and accuracy. It forced me to adapt totally different attitude towards the rest of the movie: this was war, nothing less or more, just war like it was in Summer 1944 in bocage hell of Normandy.Captain Miller and his squad's mission is to bring back Private James Ryan, whose all brothers are killed in various theaters of war almost at the same time and he is now the only surviving son of the Ryan family. Despite this naive plot setting and some emotional and patriotic overtones (like scene of Gen. Marshall referring to Lincoln) they seem irrelevant since the movie is all about a squad of Army Rangers, their fighting, suffering and griping in Normandy battles. The chaos of war is captured very well with airborne troops and German units scattered all over Normandy cut out of command and communications. Sometimes only a wall separates Germans from Americans and solitary German machine-guns and snipers take their toll even before Captain Miller's (Hanks) squad even reaches Private Ryan's unit in a remote village. As they finally reach the ruined village, Ryan refuses to leave and Miller decides to stay also to defend an important bridge. As the troops wait for a German attack, there are some good scenes like idle soldiers killing time talking "grunt talk", but also the worst scene in the movie: Matt Damon starts to tell Miller about some "hilarious" events taking place with an ugly girl at attic of his homestead's barn. I think this scene could have been easily been cut out, now it looks only a clumsy attemp to bring depth in the Ryan character.The final battle is another longer combat sequence in this movie and it takes place in the streets of Ramelle. The fighting is again shown in a realistic manner, but I doubt that the elite German SS would advance the main street with tanks like in a parade while expecting US resistance. And at some scenes Germans just seem to run mindlessly towards intense US machine gun and sniper fire without any cover. There are some macho scenes, like sgt. Horvath (Sizemore) and a German running out of ammo and throwing helmets at each other. But these issues might only matter to WWII history buffs (like me) and generally the combat is more realistic and intense than anything ever seen on the screen before.At the end of the bloodbath, only two men are left of original Miller's squad with Miller gasping "Earn this.." with his last breath to Private Ryan. The very end is a return to the beginning of the movie, with Ryan shown as an old man making visit to Miller's grave in Normandy. The final dialogue is between Ryan and his wife, and the scene is a bit Spielbergishly over-melodramatic with Ryan asking his wife is he a good man. And he then makes a military salute to Miller's grave, which I think is a proper end to to this great war movie.Overally, this is a classic war movie, perhaps not the greatest of all time but at least best of the 90's. The acting is excellent, Tom Hanks making his best role so far as emotional, yet tough Captain Miller. Certainly would have deserved an Oscar for that. Supporting roles are also good, but perhaps kind of one dimensional and shadowed by Hank's Milller character. Effects are equally good, on the special and sound department. The washed colors work well and add to realism. The general feeling of being there is captured very well.**IMPORTANT HISTORICAL NOTE** *Some British comments here state that there were other nationalities like British and Canadians in Normandy Invasion. Of course there were, but this movie is about a squad of men, not the whole vast scope of the Invasion. If you are looking for that, watch also "The Longest Day". SPR is by no means telling that the Americans made Normandy Invasion single-handedly.The scene where Miller and some airborne officer are talking about the progress of the Invasion and refer to General Montgomery as "Overrated" or "he can't get through at Caen". They were just talking about how American GI's really thought during summer 1944. There WAS a certain amount of friction between western allies and this movie is not claiming that British were incompetent-it merely show what was thought in those days.*I give "The best war movie of the 90's" a score of 9.5/10PS. The Thin Red Line, the other big '98 war movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece. Saving Private Ryan makes you think by just showing what war really is. The Thin Red Line shows what war really isn't and wants you to think like director has already thought for you.</fullReview>

The fact that it was denied the Best Picture Academy Award is a crime.Tom Hanks was wonderful as the leader of the small band of men in search of a missing paratrooper. His performance was by no means bad but I personally do not believe it was impressive enough to earn him the Oscar. Or perhaps to be more fair it was not as impressive as some of the other work done in the same year.SPR is a blueprint for how to make a truly wonderful what I would call a "fictional documentary." (based in fact but with a fictional plot line)The most telling moment for me was the first time I saw this film in the theater. When the final scene faded out and the credits rolled there was total silence. Not a single person in the packed theater uttered a single word and for a few moments no one even moved. Then, slowly, everyone quietly stood and left. This is the only movie I know that has left an entire audience totally speechless. Probably because Mr. Spielberg had already said everything there was to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing War Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is as good as people say it is. Another unbelievable achievement for Steven Spielberg. I also believe, like many others, that this film should have won the Best Picture Oscar at the 1998 Academy Awards. I'm truly glad, however, that Spielberg snagged the Best Director Oscar, a well-deserved win for him. This movie is definitely in my Top 20 of All-Time and, in my opinion, is the second greatest war film (behind Platoon), though I cannot say I have seen The Bridge on the River Kwai, one that I will have to rent. An amazing war picture. 10/10</fullReview>

Spielberg has steered clear of glorifying any event, or of undermining realism with "cartoon"ish style violence.My only criticism is that the film portrayed the war as an American/German conflict. Despite the D-Day landings being a joint allied operation, we only ever see American troops and equipment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated War Movie of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent movie but still was highly overrated by everybody. The Plot was some what weak, and although i like Tom Hanks I believe he is overrated in Hollywood's eyes and thought that all of his movies get over hyped. I think the same thing With Green Mile which was a decent movie but still overrated and Forrest Gump, I personally thought Billy Bob Thorton made a better movie in Sling Blade. However Hanks did make good scores in Big and Apollo 13. I also think Spielberg is overrated. How can people say that this is better than Apocalpsye Now and Platoon the 2 greatest war movies of all time. The Thin Red Line was better than Saving Private Ryan by a hair they were both overrated. Platoon is the best war movie ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be easy to criticize a war film produced with such zeal for recognition by one of Hollywood's most talented and ambitious directors. It would be satisfying to downplay the significance of a film (like Star Wars) that is wildly popular.But the reality is that Saving Private Ryan, like Star Wars, is an inspired film created by a director at the height of his abilities. It is both a love letter to The Greatest Generation, and a warning to us younger folk that war is indeed hell.The famous opening battle scene probably changed more minds about the utility and glamor of warfare, than all of Baez's and Dylan's protest songs combined.Speilberg's bravery in bringing such a scene to the popular audience has rightly been rewarded by placing this film in in the pantheon of the best films of all time.Lets hope that this film sets a new standard for the war film genre. Lets take the glamor out of war and leave it where it belongs, like on a beach where the only thing being blown up is an air mattress.</fullReview>

I mean, there were mostly British and French people who were fighting in Normandy, oh yes I know that USA soldiers were there to. So the big question is why isn't there a film about the fight in Omaha?

Unfortunately, the uneducated, buy anything that is told to them by a screen American public justifies his ego by buying tickets to his films. Saving Private Ryan is just another war film written by an ambitious, highly paid writer hoping to slap a few scenes together with as little thought as possible and win an Oscar as a result. If this movie was released in 1999 it wouldn't have been nominated for anything. If you want to see a GOOD movie, go see Girl, Interrupted, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia or even Toy Story 2! They are all FAR superior to this attempt at saying to Americans "we won the war, with no help whatsoever, and we beat the rest of the world, yippi!"

The USA did not win the war on their own, that's right, but I don't think it's right to complain about not having the other allies in the movie. It's historically correct as it is. The americans landed on some parts of Normandy, while british troops landed on other parts. And as long as the story in this movie is as it is, there's no reason to "mingle" with other nations...I've also seen people complain about the flag in the end. I think that is to show great disrespect for all the americans who were wounded and killed in WW2, all that participated for that matter.That's my humble opinion...</fullReview>

'Saving Private Ryan' pools together an gritty, harsh truth with stellar performances from each and every member of its cast, from Barry Pepper's Bible reciting sniper to Tom Hanks' battle hardened captain.Genius is certainly a word that is thrown around alot, with little to back what it is normally labelled to, but to give this movie any other name would be putting down the film and the message it delivers. This is a film that is guaranteed to make you feel everything that Speilberg wants you to.Shamefully ignored at the Oscars for Best Film and Best Actor, a consolation can be found in the fact that it was given 5 other Oscars, including Best Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is certainly a good film, and a major technical achievement, it is little more than that. After the stunning first twenty minutes the movie begins to falter. The storyline seems to be based in asking the question 'What is the value of one life?' The characters struggle with risking all of their own lives to save just one. Is duty and honor important enough to die for? What if Ryan turns out to be a complete degenerate? It is a pretty heady, and ultimately unanswerable question. Yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film, Spielberg answers the question for us. This is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings. It cheapens the film. When Hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama. When the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know he'll be dead in ten minutes. When they release the German soldier we somehow know we'll see him again. How many cliches and obvious plot devices can one throw into a 'realistic' movie? How about the celebrity cameos that feed a director's ego,but serve only to distract the audience from the film (Hey! Isn't that Ted Danson?) For the most part it is completely overblown, gratuitous melodrama. It isn't even the best war movie ever made, much less the best movie ever. It's worth the three hours, but not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing that keeps me from disliking Spielberg is his ability to step away from the block buster dollar signs, and go back to the place where movie-making is still dignified. It is as if he doesn't care if it makes money, as long as he can replenish his commitment to being a 'story-teller' every now and then with something strong and poignant. Now mind you, I have a personal reason to loving this movie, and that is because I grew up in Europe, and heard first hand stories from a ninety year old woman about the german occupation. Despite the gore, which did not deter me from my meal (we were at a cinema pub) the movie gives the new generations a good look at what true war. Not smart bombs and such, but real war, and real people. It is a super movie, but that is stating the obvious. Personally, I would like to thank Mr. Spielberg for reminding the world what the costs of war can be -- and how devastating WWII was for the people of Europe and the Allied forces. A++ for the flick, and a big tip of the hat to Mr. S.S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg at his Best?...directing wise yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own this movie on DVD and it still remains very solid amongst my large collection. Spielberg is truly a master director. Finally someone has accurately portrayed what it was like in battle. From the ultra-realistic depiction of gore and violence to the drama of the dying medic (get to that later)and most importantly portraying the wounded in battle. I also like the way Spielberg kind of exposed, or degraded the film to kind of give it an old, gritty look to it, very nice effect. Saving Private Ryan is, honestly in my opinion, Speilberg at his directing best. However, there are a few gripes. First off, I have yet to see a war movie which combined all of the needed elements to make it "the best war movie ever!" Full Metal Jacket is close but no cigar. Anyway one of the most important of these elements would be character development, in which case Saving Private Ryan had none. The whole story behind Saving Private Ryan was to figure out who the old man was. And what little character development they did have turned out to be fruitless and not very interesting. Another element missed was emotion. True, the soldiers frightened faces and yells of mass hysteria was great and all, but I thought if this movie would some how have implemented a narration of some kind, then maybe I would care for the main characters a bit more. Third element missing was the plot. What can you do in 3 hours when the whole plot revolves around going out to find someone. Walk a little talk a little, fight, walk a little talk a little fight, die, fight, walk. It seemed kind of muddled and boring. And another gripe, which isn't really a big deal, is how the medic died. What the hell is he doing charging at a machine gun nest? Since medics aren't allowed to carry weapons, I was just pondering why they would have him run along with them. I mean, what's he going to do when he gets to the enemy, heal them to death? Or maybe, just maybe, if he was in syringe range he could take an enemy out with a critical stab, ahhh die Germans die!!! Anyway, with all gripes aside, I still loved this movie. Thanks to Spielberg that is. I enjoyed it in the theaters and I enjoyed it at home. The war scenes are unmatched, music is great and overall it was well done. Kudos. *** out of ****</fullReview>

The realism of this film can have so much impact on your life if you just let it, and understand the real sacrifice that solders have made. Solders who are real people and not just names on a wall or in a book or on a death certificate. This movie was not made for your entertainment, it was made for the vets of WWII... and American vets at that. I don't believe that there is any possible way to know the impact a war can have on your life when serving in combat without experiencing it first hand. Saving Private Ryan is the closest thing possible to that. I have more respect and admiration for those who have fought for their country now that I have seen this film.

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" starts out with a very graphic, difficult, and fascinating scene of American soldiers storming the beaches on D-Day. The scene is tragic and merciless, but probably almost exactly what is was like for the real soldiers in WWII. Tom Hanks plays a Captain John H. Miller, one of the first soldiers on the beach, and a leader of the attack on the Germans at the fortified beach-heads. Three days after that first landing on the beaches of Normandy, Capt. Miller is given a new assignment: He is to take a special task force of eight men through occupied, war-torn northern France to try and find one wayward paratrooper named James Francis Ryan. The reason for this seemingly absurd mission to find one man, a simple Private, is because his mother back in Iowa has already lost three sons, and the army wants to do the decent thing and let the last Ryan brother, James, have a free ticket home to be with his mother. The movie is long, graphic, and painful to watch at times, but it has absolutely excellent acting, writing, camerawork, directing, and cinematography. This is definitely one of the greatest war films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

That really shows you that combat is hell on earth. Tom Hanks should have gotten an oscar for heroic performance and all of the supporting actors should have gotten oscars too. This film should have gotten the Best Picture of 1998 oscar, instead of Shakespear In Love. Saving Private Ryan is far more moving and has a better storyline.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a blockbuster masterpiece it features an all-star cast such as Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Matt Damon. This movie contains desterbing war violence and profanity. This movie is good for anyone with a stong stomache. And of couse if you are a Tom Hanks fan. Saving Private Ryan was a great movie all the way through. It had a strong plot and I gave it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie transport us to a different world, and for the first twenty minutes of this movie, I was transported to Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. This sequence is easily one of the best, if not actually the best, piece of movie making I've seen. That it has another sequence at the end just as powerful as the first speaks volumes about the its greatness. Spielberg's outstanding direction is matched only by Tom Hanks' portrayal of Captain Miller. Today, two years after watching this movie, almost every scene is fresh in my mind, none more than the weariness on Captain Miller's face as the final battle plays out. Together with "Schindler's List", this movie cements Spielberg's place among the best directors of our generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will never forget this overwhelming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like war films. Definitely. But I definitely think "Saving Private Ryan" cannot be considered only like a war movie. I mean, films like "Rambo", "Commando" and that kind of productions have one point in common: the main character is a hero, "the strongest man on Earth", "the renegade who's escaped from the bad fellas" and "the only one who can achieve this mission".In "Saving Private Ryan", the war vision goes one step... Not one, a bunch of steps far from the typical war film. It's not about the typical story of a "how-strong-and-brave-I-am" mercenary. The plot introduces us in the feelings, the experiences that a soldier has in a battle field: fear, agony &amp; pain. And this message reached deeply in the audience, because you feel somehow uncomfortable when watching the film. And there's the power of the film, the way with which focuses the sensations and fearings of the character is overwhelming.Steven Spielberg has done a masterpiece, demonstrating that he can do any kind of genre in the film industry. It's a must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest portrait of any war on film ever. Spielberg really is the ultimate teller of stories through film at this moment in time. It's the whole package that stands out not just one item on it's own. Whenever a new Spielberg film is released people flock to watch many without even checking the contents, due to his fantastic track record, and I have to admit I'm one of those people. But this film has scenes that take your breath away there so good, for me this is a film I can watch over and over again, and I will.</fullReview>

A wonderful cast, led by Hanks in a career-best performance (not an easy claim to make), gorgeous cinematography, and a hauntingly realistic script make for a shattering experience to be appreciated, studied, and educated with. The opening sequence has rightfully already become a classic. Unnecessary bookends are a minor flaw in this major accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From very impressive opening scene, and through entire movie, Spielberg forces only one message - war is dreadful beast which consume everybody and everything it lay hands on. Taking the beach on D-day, in this movie, is one of the most bloodiest scenes ever recorded on motion pictures. Shocking scenes of destruction and killings are very strong and horrible; for example scene where Nazi kills a American soldier with a knife in a house, where Nazi talks to him on German, and American shouts:"Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait! Listen to me! Listen to me!", is very lifelike, and it's not classical Hollywood scene. Or sniper. Or tanks. Or...everything. The idea of film is very noble - I don't know is this action ever take a place, but fact that many brothers, fathers, children...died in that monstrous event before 60 years is scary...over 50 million people have been killed.You really have to earn something in your life, as Ryan did... Then you understand the importance of life itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the hype, Tom Hanks and the first 20 minutes of this film away and you have a very routine war film with all the usual cliches, gung-ho American GI superhero gunk, all-looks-lost ending and loads of flag waving!In fact even with Hanks the film stinks. There are far better war movies around, the underrated Thin Red Line, Cross of Iron, the full subtitled version of Das Boot (The Boat) and perhaps best of all, Sam Fuller's The Big Red One.But of course they didn't get the kind of success they so richly deserved because there was no Spielberg/Hanks collaboration to get the hypemobile moving.With the exception of the truly outstanding 20 minutes, where no other film (apart from truelife documentaries) has ever come close to the realities of war, SPR sucks through a long thin straw!It sometimes amazes me how Speilberg can hit all the right notes (Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindler's List) with lots of decent action &amp; rounded believable characters we feel for; and then comes out with dross like SPR &amp; Lost World.For those that live outside the States this film will probably leave you cold - especially if you're one of those allied countries that also served in France during WW2, but didn't even get a sniff in SPR.The only decent acting came from Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath. But even he isn't allowed to develop his character before his off on another mission shooting at people and banging on that War is Hell etc.If you want heroes, if you want emotion, if you want drama, if you want a true depiction of how bad WW2 really was go and buy Schindler's List!*/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Will Live On, Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember the hype on television. Tom Hanks on Oprah. Ed Burns and Matt Damon on the View. I thought nothing of it at the time, I thought it was just another big movie by Steven Spielberg. Then one day in late summer I decided to go see this film. I walked out of the theater that day, a humbled 16 year old boy, crying like a child. What was that I had just seen? Did those things really happen? Why?Saving Private Ryan is the single greatest movie I have ever seen. A lot of people recommend movies that make you think about something, whether it be a cause, an emotion or a question. Saving Private Ryan makes you think, it makes you think of the price of our freedom. This movie, and this movie alone, shows the horrors that our fathers and grandfathers had to face. This movie has sparked several conversations with my grandfather about what he went through during the years of 1939-1945 and boy, would his stories make a good movie.I just can not describe the emotional impact this film has had on me and the ones close to me. It was made with such precision and care, it is undescribable. The story is moving, the acting is absolutely flawless, the realism is beyond comparison to any other war film and the time spent on historical accuracy must have lasted for years. Just watch the Omaha Beach sequence and you will see what I mean about historical accuracy. John Williams musical score is amazing and heart felt as is Mr. Spielberg's direction.In closing, Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. A masterpiece that should be shown in every history class across this great nation called America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Excruciatingly emotional"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan," with the possible exception of "Glory" and "Platoon" (and neither of those was about WWII) is the most spectacular and, as far as I can tell, accurate portrayal of a major world war, except for maybe one point: War is worse. And here's the difference I have with most reviewers, and even Spielberg himself; I believe that EVERY child, of about 15+ in age, should see this movie. If only for an understanding of the absolute horror of killing other human beings (and fish) by the THOUSANDS in the name of democracy or some other damn thing. I confess that I never really understood such issues as the taking of Omaha Beach on D-Day. At least, not beyond the reflection of poets and storytellers "...And those men took that beach..." I never realized quite how terrible the ground war was. As an Air Force Cadet, I studied the aspects of the world's first air war, which in and of itself was bad enough.A friend of mine was telling me what he thought of the movie today, and he said "It was enjoyable." Well, that's not quite how I would describe the experience. "Excruciatingly emotional" is more what I was feeling. Yup, I cried. And one line at the very end between a man and his wife strikes me even now, two days later. Eric knows what I'm talking about, I'm sure. I've been crying a lot at movies recently, which is odd. "Titanic", I cried at, but sort of enjoyed having that little damn burst. Before that, "Braveheart" got me every time. Even "Deep Impact" got the tears flowing a bit. But those were all a little fun in the release. As I was walking out of "Ryan," (in a theater that was, although sold out, absolutely dead silent as people exited, most looking at the floor) I felt not a cleansing, but a slightly gnawing guilt. I'll see it again. Mostly so I can pay more attention to the technical aspects of the film (if I can) and try to determine how I might someday make a film half as good as the one Steven Spielberg's genius has wrought this time. His best? Possibly. But it's hard to differentiate five or six "five stars out of five" movies. If you're looking for another, less gory but still brutal look at WWII from Spielberg, check out "Empire of the Sun," a movie that was far better than it's box office take, and one of the first people movies that makes me cry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg`s second world-war2-themed film(the first was the excellent Schindler`s List). We follow some American soldiers who are fighting against Hitler`s Wehrmacht in Normandie. The opening scene is spectacular and extremely violent, but then that was how the Allies managed to get over the English channel and over to France. The movie is very good, it has both realistic war-scenes and great drama(although The Thin Red Line focuses more on drama). All in all I can honestly say that Spielberg has gone and delivered the goods again, and what we have here is yet another important movie. I prefer this over The Thin Red Line, even if it doesn`t have the excellent soundtrack of The Thin Red Line. 9/10</fullReview>

A lot of scenes in Saving Private Ryan are really emotional. Tom Hanks plays the part of Captain John Miller. Who leads his team of soldiers deep into enemy lines, to save Private Ryan because both of his brothers have been killed and he needs to be saved since he's the only brother left.The start of the film is amazing but very bloody. It shows what those brave young soldiers had to go through in WW2.Amazing, brilliant and breath taking, just some of the words I can describe Saving Private Ryan with.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't get the image out of my head of the landing on the beach. I have always known that this was a tremendously bloody battle, but this scene really brings it home. The fact that anyone would willingly go onto the beach is amazing and demonstrates the level of committment that these young men must have had - this is courage with a meaning, not foolish, macho "courage" as it is so often depicted. Throughout the movie I found myself in awe of the way Spielberg presented these men as real people with emotions, fears, and flaws who were trying there best to serve their country and keep their sanity in such an awful and trying situation. It's so seldom that one gets the chance to see true character development that is subtle and adds to the movie rather than simply being written in as an afterthought. Forget Titanic, this should have been recognized as the best movie ever made. Everything about this movie is great, and a great misservice was done for the academy to not recognize it, not only for its technical excellence but for its purpose in trying to realistically portray the horror and courage of war.

The script is excellent and well written and fully highlights the in-humanity of war that 'Saving Private Ryan' fails miserably to do.

		<fullReview>I believe that Steven Spielberg has three objectives here: 1) to prove that war is REALLY hell; 2) to shine a spotlight on the veterans who gave and risked their lives defending our country at a time when patriotism meant something; and 3) to tell a poignant story. He succeeds in all 3, but only the third is what really interests me when seeing a movie. The other objectives lead to overdoing the gory aspects of things, and some uncharacteristically poor editing and confusing use of slow-motion. In fact much of the camerawork here seems to be uncharacteristically self-conscious for Spielberg. That being said, this still merits viewing -- it is quite memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER WAR LIKE WWII. And though Hollywood has done everything in its power to glamorize full-scale combat, Saving Private Ryan is an important reminder that war is not glamorous, noble nor pleasant in any way. In Ryan, Steven Spielberg delivers some of the most terrifying battle scenes ever committed to film, and in the process, uncovers the lingering bits of humanity found in the hearts of all men, even soldiers in the midst of an all out invasion. Most of the action in Ryantakes place on the battle field the brutality of war Saving Private Ryan is a story of mutilation. Soldier's bodies are torn in half, exploded, gutted, sliced, stabbed, dismembered, and generally desecrated in every way imaginable. And for their trouble, the lucky ones receive a quick-and-dirty burial in a mass shallow grave. It's this reality that Spielberg embraces, never giving the viewer anything less than a close-up and graphic look at the carnage. But unlike slasher or Hong Kong action movies, Saving Private Ryan was not made to impress the viewer with its creative violence. The graphic violence is meant to scare the living hell out of the audience, and give some kind of explanation for the surviving characters' state of mind. With war comes suffering for all, not just the soldiers technical mastery Despite the horrors of war depicted in the movie, even the most squeamish of viewers will find it difficult, if not impossible, to tear their eyes away from the screen during the disturbingly intense battle scenes. From the hand-held camera work (complete with occasional dropped frames for that classic WWII stock footage look), to the devastating visual effects of bombs exploding, bodies being torn to hell and, most of all, bullets flying everywhere, Saving Private Ryan is a thing of absolute wonder. And yet the visual effects pale in comparison to the sound effects which are thick and powerful, and do more to bring the audience into the world of the movie than anything actually on the screen. The opening scene beach invasion is the most intense battle of the entire movie what about ryan? Beyond the amazing effects, sets and spot-on performances from Sizemore, Burns, Davies and Pepper, Saving Private Ryan fails to deliver the knockout punch in some aspects of the story. Yes, Private Ryan is the last remaining brother of the Ryan family, and, of course it will be difficult to find one foot soldier in the middle of a war, but that's about all you get. Tom Hanks, as solid as his performance is, never quite takes his character where it wants to go, and Matt Damon's character proves practically meaningless, making it difficult to justify the loss suffered trying to save him.so does it work? Saving Private Ryan will leave your nerves absolutely frazzled and give you plenty to think about on the subject of humanity. And though, there are a few disappointments along the way, the negatives are few and the strengths are many and impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Greatest movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With out a question this movie is the best of all time. It has touched and affected so many people that have seen it, emotions run rampant, tears fall, people are in suspence. Any movie that can make old WWII veterans leave the theatre because of its realism has got to be number one. It was brilliantly directed, brilliantly written, and the acting was superb. SPR is the best of the best, better than the Godfather, better than the List, better than any motion picture of our time. This movie is simply surreal. GO SEE IT IF YOU HAVENT, buy it if you have. With out a doubt it proves that spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all TIME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is back in business again. It has been five years (at the release) with SCHINDLER'S LIST 1993, but now he strikes back better than Darth Vader's empire (who fell in JEDI anyhow). SAVING PRIVATE RYAN might not be anything out of the ordinary (the first scene is of course an exception) but it appeals to me in a strange way. The opening D-day scene is a classic piece of art.Tom Hanks (of course mr.GoodGuy) is an officer, leading Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, among others to find a private Ryan (Matt Damon) which three brothers has been killed. However you can trust the thin red line that is the plot of the mission is something to discuss, but it doesn't make the movie any worse.The realism is shocking, and the warscenes are just as intense as exciting. Great acting, and the result is simply very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg at war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, the opening 30 minutes will go down in cinema history along side the Odessa steps scene in Eisenstein's POTEMKIN (1925 - Russia) as pure classic. The rest of the film is a journey taken through the madness of war by Captain Miller, (Tom Hanks), and his men. The production values are of the highest order, achieving realism and emotional impact. I admit to be in fits of shakes during the opening and then crying on my way home. But do we have to see what we already know and that is War is barbaric in death and destructive to those who survive it. Maybe yes, because you value life just that little bit more after seeing this. Only complaint. The ending battle. I'm not quiet sure if that was a sign of patriotism or stupidity but it almost had the flavour of the Dirty Dozen kicking Nazi butt but not quiet so. By this stage it was enough war carnage.</fullReview>

This is a great film shown in such details never before seen. I recommend this film to everyone, can't say I enjoyed this film, the special effects were all too real and painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Film that Created a Moving Personal Moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was deeply moved after seeing Saving Private Ryan. It is simply the best war movie ever made. And to the European critics: it was not meant to be an all-encompassing work about the allied effort in Normandy during World War II (see The Longest Day for that). It is an American story, about American sacrifice, made by a master of American film. Its purpose is clear: to help remind and educate our country about the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation, and this education is long overdue. If Spielberg had to wave a flag and tug at emotions to do this, so be it.Beyond mere words, this film has spurred people to action. Many Americans now seek out World War II veterans to give them the respect they deserve, and to hear their stories, before they are gone. For me, it was a catalyst. My father landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, and it was with great pride that I took him back there last year for the 55th anniversary of the event. He was able to meet and discuss his experiences with many American, Canadian, and British veterans.In a particularly personal and memorable moment, and reminiscent of the opening and closing sequences of the film, my father and I visited his buddy's grave at the American Cemetery in Colleville Sur Mer. His friend was killed in action on Omaha Beach on D-Day. Memories of the friendship shared and lost overwhelmed him, and brought the visit into perspective. Yes there is honor and glory in war, but also incredible waste. May it never happen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerful and emotionally moving movies I have ever seen, it is a true modern work of art. The story is a extraordinary with many well defined characters brought together by the incredible acting. The story shows us the American side of the war and our feeling towards the Germans, but it also shows the cruelty we showed towards them, too. Steven Spielberg does an absolutely wonderful job in capturing the horror of war, a prime example of this would be the D-Day landing sequence and the final battle. As I said before, the acting is fantastic, especially Tom Hanks' performance as a Captain Miller. The music has that grand, powerful feel to it which is what you come to expect from John Williams. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, but not as anti-war as people claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly, SPR is powerful, mind-numbing stuff, but so are most decent war movies if you spend three hours in the cinema. Maybe it was just that the beginning was so hyped that it didn't quite have the impact I was expecting, although a few fantastic moments did stand out (the "lucky guy" who's helmet gets scratched by a bullet, for example). The problem is that for a movie which is so brutally honest in its depiction of the horrors of battle, the film is lazy to the point of dishonesty in so many other areas and insodoing it undermines its credentials as an antiwar film.To start with a point made in a number of other reviews, the Germans are utterly unsympathetic. The one German we feel sorry for turns out to be a real baddie, eager to kill the heroic Americans as soon as he gets the chance. The result is a movie whose values are completely the wrong way round - the war was rightful insofar as it attempted to check an aggresive and horrifically inhumane regime. It wasn't justified of itself by American patriotism, rather, patriotism provided a powerful rallying point. Yet the Stars and Stripes are far more redolent of America than of liberty itself, in spite of the perceived American monopoly on freedom. By making the Americans heroic and the Germans either faceless or treacherous, by excluding the involvement of Canadian, British and British Imperial troops, and by the emphasis on the worshipful Flag, Spielberg turned the second world war into a matter of Americans vs Germans, American patriotism vs German nationalism, rather than right vs wrong. It was the noblest of sacrifices for these men to die in a country that was halfway round the world from their homes. Many, probably most, fought for their country rather than for France, or Poland or for any ideal of liberty, but if you argue that patriotism actually justified the war, then you're back to "Dulce et decorum est". SPR certainly doesn't make war "dulce", but it comes pretty close to making patriotism "decorum", when this is precisely what many of the vilified Germans were fighting for.There are other problems with the film, with its story and characterisation. Most, however, are covered in other reviews. One thing, though: the film was much praised because all of the major protagonists are terrified by war. Yet, the same old cliche remains - the weak link in the team who is too scared to fight, but ends up finding his courage (admittedly after one of the most brilliant scenes in any war movie, where the knife fight is happening while the cowardly soldier waits on the stair). It's just a bit disappointing. So many things in SPR are brilliant and uncompromising (like the knife fight, people blowing themselves up with their own mines etc.) that all the cop-outs and compromises are additionally galling. A pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was a movie that could be described as a tour de force, Saving Private Ryan would be it. From the much-talked-about opening to the concluding battle, Spielberg has combined involving human drama with masterful technical expertise (ranging from bravura camera work to jolting editing) to stunning effect, and Ryan confirms Spielberg's status as the leading director of recent years. While the relatively plotless (but never less than compelling) middle section has attracted criticism, in terms of sheer visceral authenticity and dramatic impact Saving Private Ryan is absolutely peerless. Tom Hanks gives possibly his finest performance yet, and the rest of the cast, despite essentially playing a selection of stereotypes, do admirably well.Admittedly the battle sequences are quite bloody, and it is not quite as great as the shatteringly unforgettable Schindler's List, but Saving Private Ryan is none the less a towering achievement, and essential viewing.10/10</fullReview>

The battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite elaborate in detail. While there are many warnings about how graphic this picture is, it almost seems that there should be no age restriction on the movie, so that everyone (of all ages) can see the horrid side of war. The story line is a good one, though not true, it does remind you of the true story of the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who were killed while serving on the same navy ship in WWII). I feel the movie could have been a bit more emotional, or played to the audience's emotions better, instead it was oriented more toward the details of war, and less to the personalities of the persons portrayed serving in that war. Bottom line...it was a great movie and definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. It captures the horror of warfare, and really captures the nobility and courage of the "Greatest Generation." For those reasons alone, this film is a must-see. You will think about the story and the issues it raises for days.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's strong points include the ensemble's performances and especially the presentation of the battle scenes, which truly are harrowing.My only complaint is Spielberg's obvious and heavy-handed direction of the film's dramatic (vs. action) scenes. There is a self-conscious importance stifling Spielberg's stagings -- to the extent that you feel like you're not watching real people doing real things in horrible circumstances, but watching actors reading important dialogue on deep issues. Fortunately, this isn't the case (usually) with the scenes involving Hanks and the company members. But when a peripheral character steps into the frame -- such as George C. Marshall -- you get the sense that you're not watching a real conversation, but something self-important and melodramatic. In addition, the decision to include the opening and closing scenes, which take place 50 years after the events in the main body of the film, is somewhat hammy and unnecessary.A terrific film -- the equal of THE THIN RED LINE, the other great war film released in 1998.</fullReview>

According to the imdb-members´ rating of 8,6 making it the 12th best movie ever, Spielberg was obviously right.

War is no walk in the park, and this movie comes closest to capturing just how close to hell it really is. This movie teaches a lot about sacrifice, courage, heroism, and emotion. Sometimes there are causes greater than our own selves which are worth sacrificing for. A great movie for this era.

		<fullReview>First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re-creation footage you're ever likely to see. Definitely not for the squeamish, it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of "excitement" (which most battle simulations end up doing on some level, even the well-meaning ones). Spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown: as pure Hell, a nightmare that it is impossible to waken from.As for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence. . . well, I'm not sure. The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well. But upon further viewings, the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable. I don't know, it's a toss-up. There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his "dramatic" career anyway - I'm one who still believes there's much to be said for Tom's earlier work in comedy) but there just seems to be an overall "falseness" in the structure that undercuts some of the film's power. I wish a better framing story could have been found.But by all means see this movie. Warts and all, it's the kind that only a truly great director could make - and the opening alone is worth the cost. Just don't expect a masterpiece; think of it more as a flawed gem.</fullReview>

Let's point out the obvious one: the movie is told from the Matt Damon character's point of view -- and he wasn't even in most of the movie! There's no way he can know the story of how Hanks found Private Ryan, because he wasn't there! If you want to know why this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar, that's it. The underlying structure of the script is so flawed, it undermines everything Spielberg did with the movie. Still, this is a good movie. A very good movie even and it is certainly worth your while.

The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression "cannon fodder" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war.</fullReview>

Many people claim this movie is too graphic and violent, but the fact is that it is based on D-Day, an actual event taking place in World War 2. By seeing this movie, you get the experience of what combat in war is like, an experience you can't get from just reading a book. Many veterans and other people have stated that the battlefield scenes in this movie are 100% realistic, and the only thing missing is the smell of the dead bodies. I think Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making a good story out of history, with a great and original plot, believable characters, and realistic events.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I have ever seen. It is one of the few films ever made that actually attempts to depict war in its actual, horrific form. All of the other war films feature soldiers dying "sugar-coated" deaths, suddenly falling to the ground. This occurred maybe 1% of the time in reality. In truth, soldiers were more likely to suffer greatly before their wounds took them. War is brutal- and this film depicts it very accurately. It makes me think very much about what the soldiers in D-Day went through on June 6, 1944, and in any other battle or war. They all helped to make the world a better place. My heart goes out to all who dare to change the world in such a way.It is important to remember that the carnage of war was not only abundant during World War II, but that this happened both before and after. From the American Revolution to the Civil War, from World War I to World War II, from Korea to Vietnam, and beyond.Each time I see Saving Private Ryan, I think even more about the sacrifice a dedicated soldier will make for his country, and how many soldiers are willing to do just that.If you are one of those soldiers who helped to change the world by risking your own ultimate sacrifice and are reading this, thank you!If you are one of the many people out there that does not care about sacrifice at all and saw this movie, I have no idea what will make you care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must be seen to be believed!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the theatre with some friends to see Saving Private Ryan, nothing had me prepared for what was about to come. The opening scene on the beach of Normandy was so graphic and realistic, it was truly a sensory-overload experience. Throughout the movie, Spielberg lets action to speak for itself, instead of settling for hip dialogues that tries to sound smart.So far, this is the most well-made and greatest war film ever made. Forget what other people have said about other war movies!! Saving Private Ryan is the only film where I almost felt pain whenever I see bullets and explosions annihilate the soldiers. It has succeeded where other war movies have tried unsuccesfully to do: to shock the nerve out of you, and to make the audience fully realize the stark reality of war.Saving Private Ryan doesn't lecture about war. Instead, the scenes will do it without words. My friends and I left the cinema feeling so shocked and affected, and that's how I knew that this is the best war movie ever made. We get the message alright, because Spielberg is a true film genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of those baby boomers who arrived just after WWII and escaped Vietnam. So this movie seems to me to portray the horrors of war in such a realistic way, that it has changed my view of conflicts such as this forever. Who cares whether it was accurate in terms of the weapons used or from a historical persepective. The first 30 minutes show what war is really like and that for me was the power behind this movie. I am sure people will talk about this movie for ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another win for Spielberg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ranks right up there with "Schindler's List", "The Color Purple", and to a lesser extent "Amistad" as Spielberg's greatest endeavor (from a dramatic standpoint). "Saving Private Ryan" is by far the best war movie ever made! The film displays a sort of in-your-face realism-which is probably the next best thing to actually being there. No bombastic music accompanying battle scenes here; the only music you'll get are from rifles and explosions!I imagine people will be talking about "Saving Private Ryan" 50 years from now as being one of the great classics!Rating: 10Nitpicks (minor spoilers):1.) The opening sequence shows old Ryan reminiscing about the D day landing in Normandy (as if he was actually there), but in reality, Ryan was nowhere near Normandy on D day; therefore, should the perspective had come from someone who was actually there?2.) After releasing a Nazi P.O.W (to the protest of a few of his subordinates who wanted to seek revenge on for slaughtering one of their friends) Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) gives a nice speech on how killing a man makes him feel further and further from home each time, yet he doesn't take a second's thought when clipping a few Nazi goons in the final act. I guess Miller's philosophy is he doesn't like killing people, unless he has to!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A recreation of real brutality, not the usual "action" flick fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect that only a veteran who actually experienced the horrors shown in the film could attest to their authenticity. However, the scenes have the feel of reality as do the reactions of the soldier characters to their situations. The peg of the story that the high brass would sacrifice other men to save one man for public relations reasons certainly rings true. We are shown nothing to make war look attractive as the camera and special effects move from one aspect of bloody death to another without pause. One may carp that Spielberg takes a parochial view of the war in that no mention whatever is made of other allies fighting Hitler. It looks like solely a U.S. war. That's most likely just what it did look like to the grunts facing the krauts and the japs in 1944. He is also accused of taking a middle class view of the war: i.e. officers were teachers or other professionals, while other ranks were not. Well, that is just about the way it actually was so far as officers were concerned, but plenty of educated folks served in the ranks. Nobody in the film talks about the lofty ideals of the war. Again, that's realism. As a non-combat soldier in WW2 who served only stateside, I cannot recall ever being involved in a discussion about "saving the world for democracy". There was a lot of talk about the viciousness of the enemy, though, both before and after the U.S. involvement. I expect the soldiers "over there" were not much different. Lofty ideals are mostly spouted in the speeches of politicians. I doubt that anyone can view this film without being profoundly moved by the sheer monumental brutality depicted. Note that it is a re-creation of brutality that actually happened; it is not the fake horrors of your usual Hollywood "action" flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A harrowing journey which is amazingly filmed, edited and choreographed. The story drags you into it, even though you'll be shocked at the pain and tragedy these soldiers went through, and it makes you believe and feel for the characters like no other film I've seen in a long time.Hanks is wisely restrained, and the supporting cast are very good. I wonder if Spielberg is the talent that brings the best acting, rather than choosing the best actors around.The death scenes are unbelievably realistic, and are undoubtedly very unnerving. One scene remains in the mind long after you've seen it, and it's not the famous opening beach scene.Great realism which instills fear panic and confusion, almost a brilliant work of art if not for the forgetfulness for the other nations concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A DIRTY DOZEN FOR THE 90'S.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I enjoyed this movie and enjoy it I most certainly did let us put things in perspective."SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" is no more than a rattling good "BOY'S OWN" war action adventure in the vein of "THE GUNS OF NAVARONE" or "THE DIRTY DOZEN".It is no more and no less than that.There is more graphic and realistic violence here than there might normally be in a "men on a mission" movie but this is to be expected nowadays.I normally avoid the simpering Tom Hanks and his movies like the plague but even I have to admit that he was effective here but certainly no more so than either Gregory Peck or Lee Marvin in the afore mentioned action epics.The opening and closing sequences featuring the elderly Ryan visiting the graves of his fallen comrades seemed like a blatant attempt by Spielberg to emulate the very moving final sequence from "SCHINDLER'S LIST" and in this he did not succeed at all ;the scenes play as cloying but that is common in a Hanks movie.More powerful and evocative is the wonderful score by John Williams and his "HYMN TO THE FALLEN" is as good as anything this maestro has ever written.Enjoy this excellent movie then for what it is and do not look on it as the life enhancing experience that some critics would have you believe.It is little more deserving of an Oscar than was "THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE" and that is not meant to decry that superb 60's war movie.Cornel Wilde tapped a similar vein to "RYAN" 30 years ago in "BEACH RED" which is far more successful than the Spielberg movie in capturing the true horror of war.Forget the hype and enjoy a good late 90's action movie for that is all that "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" is. I think time will prove me right on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may be silly to say this, but I feel like I just survived World War II. But that's silly, of course I never fought in World War II. I'm only eighteen years old. But I still feel like I survived the war, because I just watched Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan."With most reviews I write for IMDB, I begin writing with a sense of purpose. I know what I want to say and how I want to say it. This time I'm at a loss. "Saving Private Ryan" shocked me out of any senses I had left, it disturbed me more than many other movies films ever had. In fact, the only comparable film I can even think of is another by Spielberg, "Schindler's List." Both classify as what I call "super-realism." The film is so realistic, so believable that one immediately forgets that they are watching actors on celluloid and is transported to the actual event.Such is the case with this entire film, especially the opening D-Day invasion. The outstanding acting crew of Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, among others, become real soldiers. We fight along side them. When people suffer, we cannot help but feel their pain.I think the most striking thing about this film from a technical perspective was the phenomenal cinematographer of Janusz Kaminski. As he did with "Schindler's List," Kaminski achieves a consistent newsreel effect, but this time the camerawork is more frantic, more likely to take us by surprise. Particularly during the D-Day sequence, we are as confused and blind-sided as many of the actual soldiers, and this adds to the intensity. Beyond Kaminski, everybody involved deserves a standing ovation, or perhaps more fittingly, a salute for making a film this great.I feel like I'm getting hysterical, and I really don't want to. Suffice it to say that "Saving Private Ryan" is a phenomenal film capable of extraordinary emotional impact, able to make us week, tremble, and practically scream out with near-agony. This film conveys the truth about war, and only those who do not fear the truth will be able to watch it. Of course, a warning is needed. Few films are as graphically violent as this one, but few have as much of a reason to be.If nothing else I've yet said made any sense, maybe this will. See "Saving Private Ryan." Or better yet, experience "Saving Private Ryan."**** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only recently seen the movie and I had to stop after the initial sequence and re-watch it twice before carrying on with the film. The effect was amazing, just to realise the sacrifice that was made by young men puts life in perspective. To see the first landing craft hit the beach and not a single man surviving was just awesome. Spielberg is a genius you actually think you are there in the water with the blood and the bullets flying around (watching it with surround sound does make a difference).After seeing the film (twice in a row) I found some Web Sites with comments made by GI's about what happened on that day, they confirm what I felt about the film.Should have won the Oscar !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had purposely not gone to see RYAN at the theater since I have a difficulty with war depicted at an entertainment venue. But it rolled over me when least expected. After a head-banging day while on a business trip, I thought just dive into a motel and watch TV. I got the last 45 minutes of RYAN instead of Frazier and couldn't turn it off. This is a military boot camp training film as it can and should be with all the chaos, sound, and death given straight up. It turned my stomach as it should anyone else's, whoever has one. This is how war must be presented on screen to convince others of its total destructiveness before decision-makers decide to enter it and before hero-wanna-be's go too rah rah by joining it. The film is not entertainment, it is a fleeting glimpse so intense but capable of leaving a necessary imprint. It is a vision of death shy of its totality but demanding of your attention. It misses one point from the battlefield - the pervasive smell of death that never leaves your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WE are Private Ryan: the movie's impact is its symbolism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is important to see the act of "saving Private Ryan" as symbolic of WWII soldier's sacrifices made to give us the lives we now have. Sacrifices they made even when they couldn't see their part in the larger picture. This is why the film is bookended with the old man and his family: we see the results of the sacrifice of Miller's squad, results they couldn't see as their friends are being picked-off around them.WE are Private Ryan, our way of life was saved by soldiers who fought and died for a cause beyond themselves, even when they couldn't always see the logic in it.The ferocity of the battle scenes are necessary for the audience to begin to appreciate the horror that real men endured so that we could have the life we now enjoy.The soldiers of WWII fought, even when it was hard, to give us the lives we now have. Now it is our responsibility, even when it is hard, to make something worthwhile out of the life they died for.This is the point of "Saving Private Ryan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not especially a fan of war movies (ie, I turn them off the instant I determine that they're a war movie). Maybe this movie represents the culmination of special effects, acting, and directing that is necessary to make a successful war movie?I like movies that mean something, and I like directors who make movies that mean something. I can't help but compare this Spielberg movie with his other WWII movie, Schindler's list. Both films have detailed WWII in ways that are at the same time nakedly objective and blatantly subjective.Spielberg tries to scrape some humanity from the holocaust in Schindler's List, while at the same time offering up the horrific imagery that was the reality. He manages to do the same thing in Saving Private Ryan.John Miller, an army officer, leads a team of WWII soldiers on a mission to find James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in the war. Ryan will be sent home thanks to a high-ranking officer who decides that it would be unacceptable for the Ryan family to receive yet one more notice of death.Throughout the film, the characters question the value of saving one person in the midst of the destruction and murder of many other soldiers. The reality of war and the movie hits home when Miller, amidst losing men and trying to find another to send home, convinces his men to risk their lives because the main objective "...is to win the war."There are some many different levels on which this film is chilling, and this movie is especially good at portraying how characters in their different stages of life interpret what's going on. And really, nobody is right and nobody is wrong. Great movie.</fullReview>

There are scenes in the movie where German tanks are rolling by in close proximity to the camera and the rumble coming from the sub in my home theater probably made my neighbors look out their windows in fear of a Panzer in their driveway!

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece of direction, the landing scene is one of the best scenes in the history of movie making. But, let's not get carried away. Now, let me tell you what this movie is all about.The whole thing about saving a private whose brothers have all been killed isn't at the root of this story, it is just a pretext to put some men in life or death situations and see how they react. The whole movie is a metaphor of WAR, all wars. Wars are used to have more lands, more power. Thousands, millions of men die in a war to please these people who want these lands or this power. In the movie, men fight and die for something that seems so insignificant: the life of one man. All these men get slaughtered for that ONE thing that is so important for some but seems so stupid to us. So, The movie is in fact a transposition of war in a context where we know all of the characters so that we don't see a man who dies just as a simple private but as a human being. I think that was the only way to show us all the horror of WAR itself, and I think Spielberg knew that.</fullReview>

The way the American GIs are "slaughtered" is unbelievable. The film has the shock value of the 'nam films, but also has the feelgood factor in the fact that the enemy gets what he deserves. Personally I didn't have any sympathy for the surrendering Nazis being shot, especially after the results of one of them being released. Tom Hanks' character is excellent - a ruthless killing machine with a sensitive school teacher. I felt the film was a bit "Americanised" - all the soldiers were American, but it reminds you if The good ole USA hadn't helped us out all us Brits would be speaking German and eating Sauerkraut by now ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has shown again his wonderful talent in Saving Private Ryan. Personally I don't like to watch warlike movies. They always look the same, they always say the same, they are the same thing each time I see one. But Steven Spielberg just has told us that a warlike movie might be a GOOD movie. He did a great job at the Schindler's list, and he did it again in Saving Private Ryan.The reality of this movie is even scary. It makes you think what would happen if a war would start now, and what would I do on front of somebody that would shoot all my partners. Would I be strong enough? He is asking that to each person that watches the movie. He is asking that. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? That is why I think is a scary movie! It looks so real that makes you think you are one of those people, and that in any time, the guy next sit will get shot. Or even that yourself is about to get shot.Not everybody is ready for a war. Most of the people is not ready for a war. And many people is not even ready to see one of the best movies ever done!I can't believe Shakespeare in love was considered better for the acadamics. That was a shame. Shakespeare in love is not bad, just not as good.In my opinion; IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE READY TO SEE BLOOD, TO SEE VIOLENCE, TO SEE THE WAY WORLD WAR II WAS, GO AND ENJOY THE MOVIE AT THE SAME TIME YOU THINK THAT THE HUMAN BEING IS THE MOST DUMB THINK IN THE EARTH.

		<shortDescription>The greatest war film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an easy film to watch. Clearly, that was not its intent. The story begins in current time at the Normandy American Cemetary in France. An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled toward a single grave. When he arrives there, his memory takes a different journey back to the beaches below on the date, 6 June 1944.From this moment on, especially for the ensuing 25 minutes, we are thrust into a story that, if it is hard to view, must certainly have been harder to live. As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most powerful statements ever put on film.When all is said and done, two brothers surnamed Ryan have died on the beaches of Normandy. Another has died within a week in the Pacific. It is discovered that a sole surviving brother has parachuted somewhere in France. It is the assignment of a survivor of Normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him home.Director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut-wrenching. However, the movie isn't all blood and gore; it's the story of young men and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the evil that they saw.Tom Hanks heads the cast as Capt. John Miller, the man who is given the mission to find Pvt. Ryan and bring him home. In one sense, it works against the film to know that Matt Damon plays Pvt. James Ryan, but not so much that you can't appreciate the nuances which Miller and his platoon come up against time and time again during their mission.I agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience, into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening moments until the film's end. It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in danger.Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.My vote: 11!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people had some great things to say about this film, i'm gonna lay them all together:1. This movie rode on the battle scenes! Although the reality and brutality shown is unprecedented in the war film genre, the actions scenes aren't supposed to carry the movie, although apparently they can and did for SPR.2. Any depth? I find it funny that Kubrick and Speilberg were close friends, because Kubrick is an intellectual and an artist where Speilberg is just a very succesful hollywood director. I can't help but compare Full Metal Jacket with Saving Private Ryan. The main difference is that FMJ is lacking the same number of barrels of blood, and it replaces that with irony, cynicism, and black comedy. The final message of SPR "Earn This" is powerful but not very intellectually challenging, compared to all the messages flying through FMJ.3. Being a Canadian (we fought the hardest beach on D-Day and got the farthest inland) I find it difficult to but this whole "I'm an american and that makes me a rambo!" The flag waving wasn't excessive but the ending "rambo" scene seemed contrived: "Good thing that god sent 7 americans to guard this bridge!"...I don't buy it!4. It is deplorable the way that Speilberg lacked any compassion for the enemy; he made no attempt to humanize them. I watched as germans who were surrendering were shot, but I hated them so much that I was glad they were. And for that I'll never forgive Speilberg. It is commendable that he could make me feel such strong emotions, but these Germans are people too! Everyone walking out of the theatre is getting this subtle message "Look what the Germans did to us!" That's not right and that's not a good anti-war message!Overall I commend Speilberg for leaving a record of WWII (and normandy) which will stick with us forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan (SPR) is a film like no other before it. For the first time ever the realism and gruesome detail of war is there for all who dare to face it. Starting on perhaps the most significant day in history, D-Day, it follows the story of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his band of soldiers as they search for one James Ryan (Matt Damon), who has lost all three brothers and has been given a ticket home to be with his mother.The soldiers sent to save Private Ryan question the motive of risking eight lives for one; a stranger, a faceless name for which few survive in trying to complete their mission to get Ryan home safely.The footage is graphic. When the hatches on the landing boats open, bodies are literally torn apart by high calibre machine gun bullets. Booming explosions, agonizing screams, the whine of bullets richocheting. At the conclusion of the initial battle, all that remains is a sea of blood washing ashore. It is immersive and I for one was left speechless and literally shaking.Some have criticised the acting, in particular the relative 'unknowns' in the supporting cast, but I believe such criticisms are harsh. The quality of the supporting cast, with Tom Sizemore and Ed Burns, plus a cameo by Ted Danson combined to make the acting quite good. Tom Hanks, as always, was Oscar-worthy, portraying the huge burden of an ordinary English teacher leading men into battle, knowing many men under his command will not be going home.SPR is definitely the best 'war' film, and one of the best films period. The very least you should get out of Saving Private Ryan is an appreciation of war and what those men experienced in trying to protect the world's freedom. Lest We Forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Private Ryan need not be saved for posterity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90's, almost suddenly, Hollywood rediscovers war and the public is expected to rediscover it as well.Nevertheless, after 2h30mn with Private Ryan, I haven't seen much I didn't know or seen anything outstanding about it.No, not much, except perhaps one scene : a black car gliding in the wheat fields of the Midwest and a mother who, looking at it through the window, instinctively knows something has gone wrong. She opens the door and stumbles as the priest steps out of the car...Spielberg could have spared us the red tide on Omaha Beach, the Colgate smile of Matt Damon and much more. This woman behind her sink says more than all the rest, she truly saves this "Private Ryan".Another positive note on the movie is the unusual appearance of cowardice. Yes ! War creates cowards, including among perfectly decent American boys. We had seen GI's weeping and panting but Hollywood seldom showed us cowards. Spielberg had the guts to go that far.For the rest "Saving Private Ryan" is just another movie, no more no less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg received rave reviews last year when his movie Saving Private Ryan made it to the multiplexes in the United States and Europe.Because of this my expectations where quite high, although I had some fears that the director best known for movies like JAWS, E.T. and more recently Jurassic Park would lack the skill of making the transition from pure entertainment into serious drama. To be fair Saving Private Ryan is not his first stab at serious movie-making. Spielberg directed the excellent Schindlers List in 1993.Sadly when I went to see Saving Private Ryan last fall my high expectations where proved wrong. The only thing that makes this film stand out compared to other war-movies are the much talked about battle-sequences which are outstanding in conveying the brutality of war.But a movie of this magnitude can not stand on battle sequences alone. It needs substance and Saving Private lacks it all. The characters are only mildly interesting. You do not care about their plight and ordeal. When not fighting for their lives they engage in a quasi-philosophical discussion about the validity of their mission. Is it right to sacrifice a handful of soldiers with the purpose of rescuing one man?(Private Ryan) The question is an intriguing one but it takes up too much time at the expense of character-development.We don't really get to know their motives, their fears and what makes them happy. This is what separates good movies from bad ones. To me this is just another action-movie but with little else to add.It seems to me that the movies which are made today emphasizes style and action at the expense of real substance. One of the reasons for the excellent reviews it has received must be that the public and critics alike where overwhelmed by the outstanding battle sequences and it's realistic depiction of gore in 20th century combat. But as I have said earlier that does not necessarily make for a compelling movie.For those of you who share my opinion with the respect of this movie I highly recommend Das Boot by Wolfgang Petersen , The Iron Cross by Sam Peckinpah and Paths of Glory by Stanely Kubrick. All in their own right superb movies that in every respect are better than Saving Private Ryan with the exception of the battle-sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many War movies with different points of view, about different Wars and different geographic locations during those wars. I have never seen such a powerful and realistically shot film, I have never been to war, but after watching this film, I left the theatre feeling, I had. It is an amazing film. Word of caution, have the DVD, but it doesn't do it justice. This film must be seen on the BIG Screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly memorable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my wife and I packed our rented Ryder truck to move from Florida to Chicago, my neighbor came walking by with his small white dog. I had seen this man, with his little dog that was so small that it looked like it should have batteries, walk by my place for the better part of a year but never had a conversation with him. He stopped by then and we chatted amicably about little things like the weather etc. As we talked, I noticed a small brass pin on his ball cap that said "D-Day Veteran." I was amazed. I collect all kinds of info on WWII airplanes and here was an opportunity to actually talk with a D-Day participant. We chatted longer about those times and he invited me into his home to show me his souveniers of that period of his life. There in an old newspaper clipping was a picture of a younger him indicating he had gone ashore at Dog Green Sector of Omaha Beach. I cannot tell you the awe I felt in this mans presence. For the uninitiated, this was the same sector that Tom Hanks' company was to have gone ashore in Saving Private Ryan.Ready for the last coincidence? My last name is Ryan.This movie has only one flaw I can see. We could have done nicely without the bookends of the old man at the tomb of Capt. Miller. It was a very touching scene to be sure, but distracting to the movie as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The single most powerful film I have seen since "Schindler's List". The opening and closing scenes are technically brilliant and punch you right in the gut - the best direction &amp; cinematography I have ever scene in a film. Everybody that I know who has scene this film has had tears in their eyes by the end.The film does lose a little steam in the middle, but not enough to make it a "bad" film as others have said. It just pales a bit in comparison with the explosive opening and closing battles. Some quibble that Spielberg caters to people's emotions and relies on that for his film's impact. Of course he does...iliciting emotion is what makes a film powerful. It has to affect you for you to care about what's happening. Spielberg has a gift for knowing what buttons to push and, while not all of his films are perfect, its why he will some day (if not already) be regarded as the best American director of all time.The best film of 1999 and possibly the decade. It was robbed at the Oscars. A 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality check.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a war film which purports to adhere to great levels of realism, here are a few thoughts: Having "been there" I can attest to the general realism of the film...ie: the panic and confusion on the assault beach, and the "pop-popping" of the cooling German 20mm machine gun. But there are two big exceptions: GI's are always ravenous and always exhausted. The characters in this film weren't real...they never ate and they never slept. Just imagine how much energy was expended with the "real GI". First; they probably got little or no sleep the night before the assault and then expended high amounts of nervous energy and adrenalin in the landing craft on the way to the beach. Second, the extraordinary life and death situation ON the beach would have depleted massive reserves of strength, and also raised adrenalin levels to the critical point. Lastly, when the beach was secured and the battle over, these men would have been near to or considerably past a state of exhaustion. Further into the film, we see the squad traveling considerable miles on foot, and like the Energizer Bunny, they just kept going, and going and going.... Lastly: Hanks was the wrong actor for the part.</fullReview>

He (Spielberg) took the First (to mention) Representor Hollywood - Tom Hanks... Bad decision. Tom Hanks is so "positive" in Hollywood - no doubht - he and only he should play Capitain Miller - our world hero! The choice of Matt Damon was not your best idea either. All your film is just showing-off, American Dream? George Washington, silly stuff like that. But please, understand? that no one in the world (exept USA) cares about this Ryan and Washington... Awful and stupid plot combines with superb directing and as a result the script fails the whole feature. But I can say that you SHOULD watch it because of the WONDERFUL cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. Mr. Kaminski - you are the best! You're a magician!</fullReview>

The movie is not preachy and anti-war. There is no unneccesary vulgarity or nudity; no evil soldiers.

Spielberg goes into a very great amount of detail with every scene. Bullets are flying everywhere and unlike GI Joe, when a group of people fire hundreds of rounds people are bound to get killed. This movie really puts things into perspective and shows you just how many sacrafices are made during war, too many to say the least. Makes you apreciate the type of life that you got now and why you are able to live that life. The acting in this film was excellent as expected with a Hanks, Spielberg type of movie.

		<shortDescription>Saving Matt Damon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the recent film directed by Steven Spielberg. A director known for his audience manipulation and subsequent audience appeal, he has stated in interviews that like Schindler's List (1993), Saving Private Ryan is a story that is meant to objectively portray war.The story begins on Tuesday, June 6th, 1944: D-day. At 6:30am that fateful morning, an initial assault wave lands at Omaha Beach. The story proceeds to follow the story of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the men he commands. The first thirty minutes of the film includes some of the most graphic violence known to the screen. With the aid of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List), Spielberg dispels any preconceived 'romantic' notions of the 'last Great War.' The pace is quick and the film visually mimics news cameras of the period. The fighting is presented as grim and unglamorous. With use of various hand-held camera techniques and astounding sound effects the audience becomes part of the war. Another fresh technique employed is intermittent periods with Hank's character is surreally caught up in the moment. One must see this film just for it's visual and aural aspect. It truly is a lesson of history. After surviving the initial attack, Captain Miller is given a new objective. To save the life of one, Private Ryan (Matt Damon). This comes to be due to the fact that of the four Ryan's that entered the war, one remains alive, or at least is thought to be alive. His life is worth risking that of Miller's and his men. From this point onward, I reconsidered the film's title to be "Saving Matt Damon". The contrived Hollywood plot was presented thus forth. Perhaps the life of the one is worth saving considering the lives of the many. I sure as hell would like to be that one life. And although a few characters suffered poignant moments, adding to much of the film's humanity, my mind could not get over the added fiction within the history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is something quite special in the 1990's pantheon of Hollywood movies- it stays with you long after you have left the cinema and truly makes you reflect on what you have just seen. Artistically it is a triumph- the cinematography is breathtaking, shot as it is with a handheld documentary style and the performances too are superb..with naturalistic dialogue and astoundingly realistic battle scenes. It works so well because it defies the cliches laid before it as a genre which even FULL METAL JACKET and PLATOON fell unwittingly into...SAVING PRIVATE RYAN acknowledges that death can come to all or any of the characters at any time, brutally, even when you expect the characters you admire the most(through careful development) to survive. And that is how it should be, because that is the nature of true conflict. The only downpoint is the portrayal of the Americans as having been the sole Allied forces involved in the war and beach landings when this was clearly not the case.Saving Private Ryan is moving, powerful and thought provoking. One of the best WORLD WAR II films ever mad and can stand proundly next to the classics of that genre.Highly recommended, though traumtic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg triumphs again. This was an amazing movie. The intensity of this movie is amazing, with cinematography so realistic you feel like you are really there. There are some scenes which are disgusting, but show the horror of war like no other movie has, this was the best war movie I have ever seen. Tom Hanks is marvelous as is Tom Sizemore. They make a great team and give the movie even more intensity because of the friendship of the two, and both of them in a war together shows the bond that grows in war, and you feel their pain as well as the soldiers that die in the movie. It is moving the way this picture is put together and shows that war is more of a surreal nightmare than it is a glorious way to show your patriotism. I think this movie definitely deserved the Best Picture award and is worth going to see, don't miss it. It is an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I passed this movie many times while visiting the Video store. I had been told it wasn't for the squeamish. One of my sons came to visit and talked about "Saving Private Ryan"... of the impact it had on him after seeing it ...that my husband and I should watch it. Having been a schoolgirl during WWII ...I felt I had seen enough of the real thing, plus plus enough war movies to last a lifetime. My son insisted, so we watched it and it was the most authentic war movie I have ever seen. At times it was hard to keep looking at the screen when soldiers were being blown to pieces, but I stuck it out. After all, this is what truly happened to these men who lost their lives, in order that we could live a free life. Something they would never do. I do remember seeing "The Sullivans" in 1944 ...the movie about the five brothers who didn't want to be separated .. .but they all went down with their ship ... bringing about the rule that this would never happen again to a family. Yes, it did bring back a lot of memories, but if a movie like this is watched by the younger ones, they'll realize what a war is truly all about. My husband feels that those who govern our countries should be made to watch this movie on a regular basis. Being the mother of three sons, I can't imagine what life must have been like for The Sullivan parents losing five sons. "Saving Private Ryan"does make you think very deeply about this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ol' Blood 'n' Schmaltz" Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know you're in for it from the opening frame, with the flag waving in our faces and the wailing horn from John Williams' typically unsubtle score. Spielberg exhibited beautiful control throughout nearly all of Schindler's List, but he loses the tone for this one from the start; and the rest of the picture plays out as a jarring struggle between two different kinds of war movies -- an unbelievably coy schmaltzfest and a grippingly violent bloodbath.I cannot agree with the complaint that the movie doesn't portray the British and Canadian involvement at D-Day. No historical film is required (or is able) to depict everything about its subject; it need only focus on one specific part of that history. Unfortunately, Spielberg's focus on his one specific part is blurred. Gruesomely effective as his Omaha Beach sequence is, it is ultimately cancelled out by one of the immediately following scenes: the hopelessly idealistic, Norman Rockwellish portrayal of the Ryan family farm. Spielberg seems to be saying that the former was needed to defend the latter; but because (as one critic has mentioned) his knowledge of history is filtered entirely through other movies and Life Magazine, he is unaware that the latter does not and has never existed. (There's also irony in the self-promoted claim of "realism" in a movie that has its soldiers talking loudly behind enemy lines, and one of them not knowing what FUBAR means. [The guy went through basic training, for Pete's sake.])It's too bad because the acting -- especially by Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies -- is generally very good. (Though Tom Hanks' shtick is wearing thin. He seems determined to join Harrison Ford, Robin Williams and Kevin Costner on the Mount Rushmore for Sanctimonious Actors.) And the subject is of course a noble one. But a noble subject does not automatically a great movie make</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me explain that I am not a big war film buff. I liked Platoon, and a few other films of this genre, but generally I do not enjoy war films. I think the reason for this is that most war films seem to glorify the act of war. They try to make war look fun and cool. Saving Private Ryan on the other hand shows you just how brutal war is. It puts you right into the middle of one of the most deadly battles of the entire war, and makes you glad that you are not one of the soldiers on that beach. This movie makes me appreciate our veterans and their struggles even more than I did before. But most of all, it makes me appreciate how lucky I am to not have to risk my life for everything I have.

		<shortDescription>Great direction, OK story, high on schmaltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan certainly deserves some accolades. The now infamous Omaha Beach scene is probably the best-choreographed war sequence I've ever seen. It captures the horrors of war in many respects - the confusion, the bloodiness, the futility of soldiers being no more than cannon fodder. The direction is, of course, stellar - after all, we are talking about Spielberg. The choice to mute the colors palette to washed out greens and greys is an especially nice touch.However, Spielberg refuses to lay off the schmaltz. Oftentimes, the scenes where he injects some humanity or includes the everyman "average joe" character (in this case the soldier-interpreter) to me appears forced. The opening and closing scenes also revel in this schmaltz, trying to bring the story into modern times and connecting it to today's audience. Spielberg tried something similar with "Schindler's List," with the stone-piling scene at the end. To me, both movies work well enough on their own without these extras. As good of a director as Spielberg is, he often resorts to these over-the-top techniques to jerk a tear or to invoke sadness. I wish he would show more restraint or find a less obvious way of expressing the same emotion.Don't get me wrong - I liked the movie well enough to give it a 7 and gladly recommend it. A bit of trimming would have made "Saving Private Ryan" a much better film though.</fullReview>

The direction was brilliant. In fact, I would say that was the number one asset. Secondarily, Tom Hanks was great and so was the intensity of the action - almost unparalleled.I nitpicked on a couple things - as I am prone to do, but the main reason I didn't give it a 10 was simply because, like Schindler's List, it was too depressing. I will never give a depressing movie a 10. Now, don't get me wrong. I didn't think it was THAT depressing, but the fact that 8 men set out to bring back one and that most of the 8 (I won't say how many in case you are the only one who hasn't seen it.) die trying to bring him back is a formula that I have a hard time with emotionally. Interestingly, the movie deals with that very subject and allows us to develop our own opinion.Be warned, however.

		<fullReview>First off, I should preface my comments by saying that, although this was an excellent film, it isn't for everyone. The intense, graphic, "in your face" nature of the presentation will be too much for some viewers to handle.The opening sequence is extremely well done. I was literally shaking after seeing the horror which faced those involved in the D-Day assault. The camera angles, combined with the gritty, high contrast filming, give the whole film a documentary feel. Unlike other war documentaries, Saving Private Ryan manages to pull the viewer deeply into the action.My only negative comments relate to the underlying premise for the movie, which seems rather far-fetched. I also felt that in some cases the special effects exaggerated things a bit more than they should have. But those are minor faults, in an otherwise top rate film.</fullReview>

Somewhat intriguing, yes. Important? Not even close.Violent? The vast bulk of this movie is composed of scenes of people being shot in the head while we watch the blood spurt out, or of people getting blown in half and then dragging their torsos by their arms. The scene where the medic fixes the "bleeder" only to then have the soldier shot in the head is an example. Amateuristically ironic? Yes. Gratuitous? You betcha? Important? Hardly.Realistic?

		<fullReview>This movie is so real and and depicts what it is like to be in battle. The beginning of the movie makes you wonder how these men, with all there courage, could go through what they did to land on those beaches in France that day. I think that anyone who sees this movie has to stop and think how much of a sacrifice was made by the real players in in that war and in any other war. I hope that those who have seen this movie will appreciate what was given by them for all that we have to day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? The opening sequences, in fact all of the combat scenes blew me away. If you'll pardon the expression. As for the plot and timeline, obviously they had to fudge things a bit for this to become a coherent whole. Also a bit clicheed in some segments. But overall a very good movie. A little note: An English film magazine asked in their review; Where are the other allied soldiers? Answer: They were to the east, which you'd know if you'd cared to do a little research on D-Day. Schmucks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The realistic war movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the realistic war movie ever made because this movie shows people getting shot in a realistic way, people blown up and the way that is made. It's about three brothers who died in the invasion of d-day. one brother is alive somewhere in the war and it's up to eight men to bring one man home alive. This movie is more real than a horror movie, but some good action sequences too. Saving Private Ryan is much more real than other war, horror, or action films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotionally powerful film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sit down to write these comments, the credits are rolling, so the event is as fresh in my mind as possible. It is difficult to write as I struggle to control my sobs. As a U.S. Army veteran, I feel a special connection to the story and to those who fought and sacrificed all between 1939 and 1945. I separated from the Army just as Operation Desert Shield commenced in 1990 and have always secretly felt disappointed that I missed military service in a combat theater and somewhat jealous of my brother who did serve there. After seeing Steven Spielberg's graphic representation of the horrors of close combat, I no longer feel such disappointment or jealousy. Instead I feel thankful that Providence led me far out of harm's way, unlike two soldiers in my former unit who did die in Saudi Arabia. If Mr. Spielberg was trying to convey the message that war is a terrible thing that ought to be avoided, he definitely succeeded with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but incomplete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it is in the nature of war films to be devoid of a sensible plot and realistic script; call me old fashioned, but these are important considerations when reviewing a film. That is not to say that I necessarily consider this to be an inferior war film, but rather that it is not the complete war film. This is a Spielberg film, and it plays to his strengths, with magnificent special effects which bring to bear the inherent nakedness of war. I couldn't help but be, for wont of a better word, shell-shocked. By preserving the film in this form, almost as a documentary, Spielberg would have been onto a winning formula from the cinematic viewpoint (although perhaps not from the bank balance viewpoint). Unfortunately Spielberg did as Spielberg does, putting into place a script and moralising undercurrent, both lacking in any sort of subtlety, which might work well in films like Jaws or ET, but serve only to blunt one's reactions to the raw images of the inhumanity of war.In sum, I consider this to be a visually astonishing and moving film, but one which is ultimately impaired by the banalities and simplicity of the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg has constructed an excellent war spectacle. This is essentially an old fashioned war film with more graphic violence. This is not to take away from the film, the battle sequences at the start and finish are probably some of the best ever filmed. They reminded me a lot of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove. Spielberg, like Kubrick uses a lot of shifting perspectives. First person perspective works the best for me. You the viewer are transported to the front line with the troops. An excellent film to watch many times. Tom Sizemore rules.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main thing that I realized when this movie reached it's conclusion was that there was many occasions of irony. Now if you saw the movie, you should be able to tell what I'm talking about.Besides the irony, the beginning scene was horrific in the gruesome sense, but true to life to the smallest characteristic. Whether it was people loosing limbs from a grenade while hiding or someone being shot down with numerous bullets while running away, you almost thought you were watching a real war scene.It was also touching in numerous ways. One way was that you got so emotionally attached to some of the characters that searched for Private Ryan. When they were killed off for one reason or another, you couldn't help but get a tear in your eye. And if you didn't, you obviously aren't part of the human race.So if you think that this movie is just another shoot 'em up war type movie, you'll absolutely wrong! It has a fabulous story line to go along with the life like war shots. A definite to watch and to own. GO NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest war films around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When is the life of one man, greater than the life's of 8. This is one of the issues raised in Steven Speilberg's great war epic " Saving Private Ryan".Set during the D Day invasion it follows 8 soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who must venture behind enemy lines in order to find and retrieve Private James Ryan who's 3 brothers have been killed in action.There are many who have said that this film includes to much gore and over the top violence, and in some way I must agree. In any war not everyone will have parts of their bodies blown off, but equally the film is trying to destroy a myth that so many have that in some twisted way war is glamorous. The majority of war films will simply have a soldier shot and fall to the ground with a minimum of blood lost, if this were the case then there would not have been so many soldiers who returned from wars minus limbs.This film deals with many of the human aspects of war, similar in certain ways to " The Thin Red Line ", soldiers are expected to obey orders without thought or question, no matter how impossible or crazy the orders may be.A solid cast hold this film together for 2hr 40minutes, with Tom Hanks well cast in the role of Captain John Miller and Mat Damon as Private James Ryan. Each and every one of the main actors in this film will stay in your mind after you have seen this film, and is because of them and Speilberg that this film is as good as it is. I feel Speilberg has dealt with a strong subject with the same level of sensitivity which was shown with "Schindler's List " it maybe painful to remember, but equally it is important not to forget the past or the same mistakes could be made again. No one should ever have to go through another war like that.If you are looking for a film with a strong story line, then I can think of none better than this, I don't think there can be a person alive who after watching this film will not look upon war in a completely different light, and remember the sacrifices which were made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this, I was with an aviation camp and we went at night to see this. About 45 minutes into the film, I fell asleep and did not wake up until the end credits. It was not out of boredom, but rather the tiredness of flying planes and telling dirty jokes at 1AM (Typical stuff at an aviation camp). Anyway, I gave Saving Private Ryan another try and it still didn't go with me. The action sequences at the beginning were okay, but the flashback technique did not work for me. At about an hour and 35 minutes into the film, my attention span shrunk. This did not really seem like Spielberg at all. The storyline seemed very boring. It was mostly a series of very long fights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie, but certainly not much of a drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sad thing about this movie is the way the story takes a backseat to the gratuitous and often unrealistic level of violence. Previously to seeing this I had heard a LOT about how overblown the violence was. I've read several letters in the newspaper from actual WWII veterans who said the movie was unrealistic; and one of my co-workers (who just happened to be a First Lieutenant in Vietnam) also said that the violence was "overkill". Watching this movie, I really got the impression that Spielberg was just using the story of Private Ryan as an excuse to make an extremely bloody war movie that every one would go see because they had heard that it was more gory than "Braveheart". You'd really think that no one died in 1944 Europe unless they were exploded or had their guts blown out, or were decapitated, or disemboweled or something. When Tom Hanks pulls his radio guy over and his face was gone, I was like "Oh please, give me a break!". This was much more of an action movie than a war drama. I thought that "The Thin Red Line" was a much more thoughtful and dramatic movie that didn't rely on such copious amounts of violence. It was a far better picture. As was "Full Metal Jacket", and "The Deer Hunter", and "Platoon", and Apocalypse Now" etc., etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne, eat your heart out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Speilberg's WWII epic "Saving Private Ryan" so great is the fact that it takes a plot from a 1940's war propaganda film starring, oh...perhaps John Wayne... and makes it real. The plot line is simple: Eight men are assigned to find one man whose brothers have all been killed and send him home. The question is, is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? Speilberg, in all of his brilliance, manages to take this simple story and uses it as both an excellent character study and as a vehicle for graphic depictions of World War II: No more is there blood and glory....Just horror and fear. These men who are fighting aren't the fearless war heroes of all the propoganda films of the 40's. On the contrary, they are normal, average men who are afraid and who hate this mission. They aren't just actors...They are you and I in these situations, presenting our humanity and our frailtiess in chaos.This might be the first film to depict World War II in such a way. Of course, it helps that it is backed by an excellent cast (Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Ted Danson to name only a few) that knows how to portray each character in memorable ways. But also, this might be the most gruesome of all wars films, not beating around the bush when it comes to the realistic violence that resulted from the war. Limbs are blown off, brains are shot out....The violence is aplenty, but not in a way to glorify it, as many war films do. No, this film uses it to reiterate the original idea: War is hell...no, it's worse, and it's not something be glorified. These men sacrificed their lives for us, being no better than us and no worse....And if it was you in the situation, you would have to do the same. Respect that.There's no question about it. This film *should have* won best picture, and it was absolutely robbed. If "Shakespeare in Love" was one millionth this film, it might have had a chance at competing against it.... How it beat this masterpiece is beyond me....Ignore the foolish academy. This film is the greatest of 1998...Perhaps one of the greatest of the decade....********************************************************************************************** out of ****</fullReview>

There were no good or bad soldiers in it, just poor fellows in one of the worst possible situation a young man can find himself in.I could identify with every one of the guys in the platoon. If I would been forced into military service now, I would end up like Tom Hanks' character.Someone wrote that the movie praises the USA for fighting good wars by showing the star spangled banner at the beginning and the end.

		<shortDescription>This is war as it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a World War II historian and after talking to many veterans of war myself and after having served in the Air force for four years, I can appreciate a film like Saving Private Ryan. This is war as it is. The bravery. The stupidity. The loss. Nobody ever wins at war, you just hope to survive and get back to your family. There's plenty of 'guts' in the movie and I'm glad hollywood finally has the guts to show this, and war as it is. I don't like the ultra-violent action films made now, but this violence has a purpose. What 150,000 Allied troops went through on June 6, 1944 cannot be experienced first hand, but this film comes close. Just think, Steven Spielberg gets us off of Omaha Beach in just twenty minutes. For those who actually participated, it took them from 06:45 hours until well after 12:00 hours. That's around 6 hours or more. Just think of what hell that was for those who landed on Omaha Beach that day which will be remembered as the LONGEST DAY. Spielberg couldn't have assaulted us with 6 hours of combat footage, so he did the next best thing: 'e got us off the beach on the quick.The story itself is deep in history, not just of WWII when they mention the story of the Brothers Sullivan who died on the same ship in the Pacific, but also mentioning Mrs. Bixby's loss in the Civil War which is also a cornerstone of the plot. Think of the sacrifice real people make on the homefront when they send their loved ones off to war. This sacrifice cuts to the core of the story. Should we sacrifice all of one woman's off-spring for God and Country? No is the resounding answer. An answer that tells us that sometimes one common man is as important as the world entire.Private Ryan lives a good life. That's what he must do. Many men lost their lives so he could have his. So who does Private Ryan represent? One man in the war machine. One man to whom the war machine sacrificed an arm. Private Ryan represents you and me. Many men sacrificed their lives for us. Many people sacrificed their loved ones for us. Now we must all be like Private Ryan. We must all lead a good life.Saving Private Ryan reminds us of this sacrifice. That is why this movie is a must see. Ninety-percent of US have never been to war. Ninety-percent of US don't know what war is, really. Ninety-percent of US need this movie to have a taste of what war is. Ninety-percent of US need this movie so we may know the sacrifice made for our freedom. One hundred-percent of US need this movie so we appreciate our freedom.Thank you Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wrong message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that the battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan are the most realistic and horrifying I have ever seen. I think most people will have some images of that film with them forever. My problem with the film is that it makes it seem like it was all worth while, not only the search for Ryan, not only WWII, but war in general. I'm hoping it was intended as an anti-war film that fell well short of the mark, but the opening and closing shots of the stars and stripes says that this wasn't the case. With the flag fluttering in the breeze, America (and the allies included I presume) fights just wars, fights GOOD wars, and Ryan being saved and then going on to live a decent, honest life, raising a family etc. is proof that it was worth it. Maybe the fast pace of the film compared to other (and what I consider better) war films like The Thin Red Line or Gallipoli is what makes it so popular. (Just compare the final scenes of those two films to the final scene of SPR). The message I got from Saving Private Ryan wasn't one of the futility of war. It was a much more realistic portrayal of the horrors modern warfare but, in the end, a romantic view none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What?" people ask me, "You liked Saving Private Ryan Better than 'Schindler's List'?"There are many reasons why I feel "Ryan" is a superior film.First look at it from the technical aspects. These include Directing, Cinematography, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Lighting, Set Design, and so on and so forth. Don't get me wrong, "List"'s technical aspects are great, (that breath taking black and white cinematography) but "Ryan"'s are just superior.Now look at it from the acting point of view. "Ryan" is not only a great technical movie but an excellent acting film too. I'm not talking about just Tom Hanks alone; it was the supporting characters being lead by Hanks that really did it for me. And Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham, when he kills that German, that is one of the three times I've cried in a movie. "List"'s acting is very good too, but it is so many people that it is hard to get attached to a character. "Ryan" had a nice concentration of excellent performances, and you came to identify with all the characters that didn't die in the first scene.This got ten out of ten stars for me.</fullReview>

With his performance Tom Hanks once again proves that he is one of the best actors of all time, putting in one of his best performances. It is extremely accurate with not even the smallest details being ignored. Steven Spielberg is yet to produce a bad movie. The violence in the movie was an absolute necessity, making it more powerfull than any other war movie or drama for that matter. It is a tragedy that it lost to Shakespear in Love for best picture. No question it was the best movie of the year. It is a true tribute to the veterans of World War 2 and gives them the respect they deserve for laying down there lives for America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember, as a kid, watching films like "The Wild Geese", "The Big Red One", "The Great Escape" and "The Dirty Dozen" among many, many others with my dad. Now I've got a son (only 4 years old at the moment, so a bit too young), I can picture my self a few years down the line watching this with him on tv. Letting him stay up late to see it, maybe.Whereas I watched all those old films as a kid and went straight out with my toy machine gun with my friends and played soldiers, this film would perhaps have caused me to consider the futility and senselessness of war. Then again, I'd wager that it probably would not have, as there are so many memorable moments that I would have loved to have replayed in the playground. My personal favourite is Tom Sizemore and a german soldier throwing their helmets at each other, having run out of ammo, but these moments come along at a steady rate.I know that some people will appreciate the film as a whole, but hate the modern day beginning and ending. I know it's a bit corny and flatly played, but the idea is spot on for me. Just like Schindlers list, you see what saving one life leads to, and why it is worthwhile.When Tarantino was promoting "Pulp Fiction", he did an interview with the BBC here in which he said he would love to make a "men on a mission" movie. I'd love to see it, but maybe Private Ryan has put him off. I hope not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Spielberg Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Saving Private Ryan with some trepidation. I saw it late, and on the small screen. I knew about the initial half-hour, and had read the criticisms of the film from the right and left of the political spectrum. It seems all the "political" reviewers didn't like it, and I was prepared to be disappointed. All I can say is "wow!". Saving Private Ryan is one of the most gripping films I have ever seen. Gripping in the sense that it grabs you and doesn't let go. You belong to it for the almost 3 hour running time; you can't think of anything else, you can't leave. This is a film you will be thinking about for days afterwards. It is a must rent, a classic. But, if you have lived in a cave for the last two years and haven't heard, the film is highly graphic in its depictions of battle, and is not for the faint-hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful first 30 mins of a film, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this I was trembling. I stared as I watched hundreds of soldiers get mutilated. I trembled because this happened and I have been to the beach. It is graphic but this is just to me total realism. I felt it is time that war is shown at its full gruesome truth. I think a lot of people will. take more of a standoff view to war. This movie in its first 30 mins is a total anti-war movie but still gives total credit to the men who fought in it. The performances are first class and the cinematography and sound send chills down your spine. I really feel so much for soldiers now after viewing such waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action scenes, bad sappy scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's core simply follows a small group of Americans kicking ass behind enemy lines. Maybe it's just me but I never really warmed up to most of the characters in that group, and found the "heartwarming" backstory anything but.Regardless, the "you are there" intense action scenes make up for the faults in the sappy department. Although again, once we are following the crack commando group, the battles no longer seemed particularly real to me since only the enemies are dying. That seems to reinforce the stereotype of the invincible heroic soldier that actually makes war look appealing. Plus, it went on so long I was definitely getting rather tired of it by the end. Watching it a second time on video was completely un-worthwhile in my opinion.Anyway in the end I give this movie about a 3 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan managed to do to me what only a combination of action/drama/comedy movies can do. It kept me at the edge of my seat in the intense battle scenes. The acting was genuinely good. The graphic nature was only excessive in the very first battle scene (it was not necessary to see the guy screaming Mama with his guts out). Otherwise, no other movie has been able to show me the intense horror and the gravity of war. The soldiers did not have romantic deaths like in most other movies about World War II. In American history, I thought only Vietnam was horrific, but this movie surely changed that picture. It is one movie that I absolutely loved, but I don't think I can tolerate seeing it one more time. I am not American and have no relatives who fought in WWII, so I cannot relate, yet I can feel it through this movie. The only other war movie comparable to this one is Glory. This is one movie definitely worth seeing. If you don't like it, you probably missed something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well..watched this one and I have to say that the first part of the movie on Omaha beach is pretty, pretty intensive. Can you say intensive? My eyes reached their information processing-limit.However, after this, the movie just wanders off and becomes a 'feel-good' story, where a couple of soldiers find themselves hopping all over Normandy in search of a guy called Ryan.We see lots of American flags, heroism, shabby dialogue, a miscast Tom Hanks (I kept picturing Bubba next to him, telling him about shrimping) and of course bad front jokes.As for the US-centered approach..it's understandable. Paul Verhoeven's Soldier of Orange was centered around Dutchmen as well, even though lots of other countries participated in the (entire) war. British warmovies focus on Brits. And so on.All in all, not an awfully bad movie to watch but not the ultimate classic it was portrayed to be. For that, we still have to go to Apocalypse now or Full Metal Jacket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Not for Tom Hank's Oscar worthy performance, for the riveting tale, or for the shocking realism. Nope, I loved this movie for the actors. I think that as a whole the cast did an incredible job filling the shoes they were given. First and foremost, was anyone else absolutely taken by Barry Pepper as Private Roy Jackson? Ever since seeing this movie I have been glued to my computer watching his fan website for updates on magazine articles and Barry sightings. This guy is one to pay attention to, he is definitely going to be big. Those cutting eyes say it all. Second, Giovanni Ribisi. His sleepy stare combined with his sensitivity make any one swoon. This isn't just a phenomenon for Mr. Ribisi, either. In every other movie he has had a major role in, he has taken over the screen. How about Edward Burns? Granted, he does play a New Yorker with an attitude in almost all of his films, but he does it so well we can forgive him for that. This cynical beauty of a guy plays the quintissential smart mouth that we love to hate, and love to love. I wouldn't mind being the butt of some of his cutting jokes. And how about young Vin Diesel who plays the ill-fated Private Adrien Caparzo. Though he doesn't make it very far into the movie, he makes a great impression. I don't know whether I can't get past his great body or his heart melting voice. And then there's Adam Goldberg. A talent to be reckoned with. This guy plays the good smart allick. The flip side to Edward Burns' biting character, this one is the nice-jerk. I just hope that Goldberg doesn't get type-cast as the token Jewish guy. It would sure be a shame, this guy can work the camera. And what about Jeremy Davies who played Umpum? I find it hard to comment on him. It is largely due to the fact that I can't bring myself to like him. It is not his fault, he was only playing a character. Was anyone else out there screaming mad when he made it through the final battle? I would have traded him for Wade (Ribisi) or Pepper (Jackson) any day. And was anyone else ready to burst into tears of sorrow when we had to bid farewell to both our luscious, silent but gorgeous types?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Washes Ashore.Here you have two, not one movies, at the price of one. The Masterpiece, is the opening half hour, and the final half hour battle in the bombed out town. In between, we have Sgt Rock characters, with some trendy gore and UN style stereotypes.Its essentially a B film with mass amounts of $$, FX expertise and speechifying thrown in. I always am leery of any film that presumes to 'Tell us what WAR is really like'-that is crap. The only way to REALLY tell it as it is-would be to simply stick a camera crew on Omaha Beach or in Stalingrad at the time, and let'em roll; guts and all.That's it. Here, we have Forest Gump trying to be John Wayne(nice try, but forget it-no way) and a bunch of 20 something directors like Ed Burns pretending they are grunts. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I like the intention of the movie, to show how horrible it all is, and etc.-but the way the film was marketed-its producer telling us its not 'John Wayne up the beach'-that was nuts.Sure guys, it was TOM HANKS AND STEVEN SPEILBERG up the beach, complete with SAM MALONE FROM CHEERS inland to recieve them. Gimme a break.You want a realistic war film? Try 'the Big Red One' or 'Platoon'; and the first 30 minutes of this one, too. Skip the rest, it's just a jacked up episode of Combat, without Vic Morrow's credibility and with old Mr. Gump there....Two ratings: For the Landing sequence and the final battle: ****. For the stuff in between: **. Try again, Steve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, very rarely, a film comes along that blows itself off celluloid and straight into the mind. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN begins in a way that leaves the viewer gasping, as we see the D-Day landings in all of their hideous glory. The opening battle scene is one of the most raw and frightening sequences ever captured on film as we are spared nothing from the battlefield.The rest of the film is spent with the examination of the effect of war on the psyches of the men involved; how the cling to memories of home for survival and the way they band together in order to keep each other alive.The performances are terrific, but it is the superb direction by Spielberg from Rodat's emotive script that really makes the story. He got the Best Director award, but how the film was overlooked as Best Picture at the Oscars by a daft bit of fluff like SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE boggles the mind.I urge you to see this movie, but be aware that it goes beyond a story on screen and will leave you touched inside and thankful for the peace that exists for most of us today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful visceral effect but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is an artistic masterpiece that works best as a monument to those who fought for the 'Good Guys' during WWII. The argument that the Germans during the war were not on the bad side is wrong. That they, on a grunt level, were also just kids stuck in a war is true. Spielberg does not show this for a reason, he's honoring the sacrifice and victory of our fallen Americans in the war. The battle scenes are incredible pieces of gut wrenching artistry and the chaotic slaughter of the first 20 minutes means something to the story, but that story fails at achieving its more provocative, yet slightly out of focus ideas. The ideas are there, and they can be reached through the important viel of the film's realism. But Spielberg, for all his visual brilliance does not make it work. In fact, it seems like he is constantly trying to cloud over our thoughts that may come out of the film with a scene that is meant to close out a story that should not be ended so easily. The men fought and died and lived through that hell for the world we live in today, but instead of letting us contemplate the worth of that sacrifice and allowing those moments of horror to manifest themselves in our minds along side the lives we, as the generations born into that infant world which have taken advantage of this age, Speilberg (and or the screenwriter) has ended the story of that sacrifice. Ryan works as a metaphor for the men who lived to go home and rebuild, or build lives. But that metaphor has a serious flaw when the character is shown finalizing his internal conflict. Well, with that, it seems less of a thanks to a generation. Tom hanks, on the other hand, gives one of his best performances, so does Tom Sizemore (with what little he had to work with). Everyone else overacts. No kidding. The dialogue is very bland and repetitive. Spielberg and Hanks lend them power, but that doesn't hide the awkwardness. I enjoyed the interested paradox of having an incredibly violent war film be patriot. It shows us the horror and nobility, both right next to each other, hand in hand. It shows men facing their own deaths as individuals as a greater good stands in the shadows, but almost completely out of site. That is important, this is one of the first films to do that. But there's a better way of characterizing the men than giving them each a monologue in the minutes before the final battle, or simple stereotype characteristics. Yet this was not what I was thinking when I first saw the film. As an experience the film works, and like a great film, it stays with you. But the more I thought about it, the more its moral and metaphorical problems came to the surface. It's definitely worth seeing, maybe even twice, but it will never provoke its ideas on a deeper level than the logistic banter of the men. It's almost too visceral. For more ideas, see The Thin Red Line. the too films both try to say the same thing (one with a flag, the other with the Earth we fight over), but one succeeds where the other comes just within reach, but not artistically gutsey enough to grab hold and run. They are both about Human dignity in the face of the inhumane. One encompasses the WWII generation, the other encompasses the entire human race. We've seen violence, and if we're not trying to survive it, we should be thinking about why it is. Only then can we overcome it. It's a noble gesture, but impossible. It's bleak, but then again, we're only human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laughable dialogue, hackneyed acting, war film cliches piled high (like Spielberg grafted on every single famous war movie scene he'd ever seen into a contradictory, muddled mish-mash: War is hell, war is noble, war is spirit changing, war is savage, war is uplifting, war is horrible, war is brotherhood, war is ironic, war is epic, war is petty etc. etc. this is how he cons the audience into concluding "this is the best war movie ever made," that and the fact that many viewers are secretly titilated by the flying limbs and exploding bodies peppering this best war movie ever made. I can just picture Stevie thinking 'I'll take this bit of Das Boot and combine it with Guadalcanal Diary and and then throw in some Apocalypse Now style irony and then...').Brilliant premise, as if the generals planning the largest sea-land invasion in history are worrying about a poor mother in Iowa. I like how all the characters are about as multi-layered as "The Dirty Dozen," the cynical quipster Brooklyn, the clumsy rookie, the fast talking, Nazi hatin' Jew, the bible quoting expert-marksman southerner, the muscular guy, etc. etc.) Ridiculous monologues (Private Ryan: "Picture a girl who took a nosedive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down. Haw Haw." this from a character who symbolically represents America and has the movie named after him), banal bawdy soldier banter (Ed Burns "She's a 44 Double E-who ah!")My favorite part is when our heroes are behind enemy lines and then casually stumble around and tell jokes in loud voices-fitting with the film's total lack of military realism, especially the action movie ending where the plucky heroes take out a legion of tanks with Richard Dean Anderson-like "sticky bombs". Silly patriotism, maudlin and sappy John Williams score... and don't forget buckets of Sam Raimi style gore so critics think it's an art film (it's so violent, it must be important)! Still, nice photography by Kaminski and the opening bloodbath is effective though significantly overrated. As far as I'm concerned, Stevie peaked at "Jaws". Go see "The Thin Red Line" instead. It may be flawed and too slow for audiences who found "The Matrix" to be thrilling cinema but Compare Malick's believable portrayal of the confused Japanese soldiers (who by the way all behave differently to war's horrors and are individuals) with Stevie's portrayal of the Germans as evil double crossing villains not far removed from the kooky Nazis in his thrilling Indiana Jones trilogy. Unfortunately the world is more complex than as seen through the eyes of Spielberg or Frank Capra (although both excel at propaganda). One of the most jingoistic widely acclaimed films in recent memory( and the seventh best film EVER according to the handy Internet Movie Database).</fullReview>

I don't think any film has ever given a more realistic rendering of being under fire, but after the action there are only platitudes and more platitudes.I suggest that those who think this is the greatest war film ever made take a look at Kubrick's "Paths of Glory". Economy of means, sobriety of tone, only the slightest touch of sentiment at the end to humanize the story. Spielberg seems to be a fan of Kubrick's (I noticed some discreet visual references to Full Metal Jacket in the sniper scene) but he's still very far from reaching that level. And he doesn't seem to be making any progress (similar comments can be made about the vastly overrated Schindler's List).Briefly, Spielberg is a technical master who simply cannot escape the trap of syrupy middle-class sentimentality (with heavy string orchestration by John Williams, bless his heart) that always dissipates the potential impact of his films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is an over-whelming thought provoking film which takes the baton from Platoon as the standard for war movies. Not that it is necessarily better, but it certainly raised the bar in technical achievement and graphic violence.Another winning combination of Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg, the technical achievement of the opening act (D-Day invasion) is worthy of all the praise and awards the movie garnered. Spielberg again shows us, as in "Schindler's List", his unique way of depicting violent death as something that happens to real people, not simply a cool effect to rid the plot of bad guys. This 25 to 30 minutes of the film is one of filmmakings all-time great achievements. Spielberg's real genius in his "serious" films is his knack for allowing us to enter inside and feel the chaos and emotions. SPR, Schindler's, The Color Purple and even Jaws surround you rather than hit you in the face.There is a line spoken by one of the soldiers shortly after they receive their seemingly inane assignment to rescue one man: "This Ryan better be worth it". A sort of prophetic statement that to me commented on the man, the mission and the film itself.A great film, for sure, but not perfect, and certainly not worthy of #7 on the IMDb top 250. The script is a little too clean and clever for a bunch of kids thrown into combat, and it so, so violent and depressing that it is physically exhausting. I feel that after the stellar and gut-wrenching opening act, SPR never lives up to the standard it sets for itself.However, if the opening and closing acts are even 1% accurate in their depiction of combat, then this movie should be used as war deterrent.Not Spielberg's best, but certainly a noble film and a technical watershed in movie making.***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting a higher standard for "war" movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie comes along and sets a new standard for the class. In this case "Saving Private Ryan" has achieved that place in two areas: the "war" movie and the "human condition" movie. On one hand "Ryan" does not mask, shield, or taint combat in any manner from the viewer and lets the experience of war happen in all of its stark reality. I have a feeling that any movie depicting war will use "Ryan" as a model from now on. The strongest message that the movie sends is that in war there is no motivating sound track and people do die horribly, without mercy, and often without reason. Drowning in eight feet of water within reach of the beach, applying a bomb that goes off prematurely and having no effect on the target, being shot by an unseen sniper, are all displayed without glory or the indication of some greater purpose being achieved in the end. What is left are those alive and those that are dead and those that are alive must live with the horror of what they have been though.But, the really great "war" movies are not really about war, but are really about how people react to an extreme condition that they are faced with. In this case "Ryan" moves from one gender to another without the viewer realizing it. Much has been said and written about the battle scenes in the movie and far too little has been said about the emotion between the squad of soldiers and how they feel about trying to rescue someone they have never met. In the countless movies I have seen about the same basic topic this one tells the untainted truth about this emotion. The soldiers do it because they are ordered to but like every American soldier, marine, sailor, or airman that I know, they don't like it and they will let everyone know about it. But beyond that the film also shows the American combat soldier as they really are: crass, vulgar, dirty beyond belief, prone to raw humor. But where this film excels is the depiction of why they are how they are: long days of stress, fatigue, danger at every moment, living moment by moment. By the time the troops leave the beach and the horror there, the viewer accepts their condition and forgives their behavior and manner. Even the word "forgives" is bad word to use. The film generates the emotion in the view that these troops have "earned" the right to behave in any manner that they please. They have paid for that right 1,000 times.But the humanity prevails in many ways, some large and some small: the raw emotion when one of their squad falls in combat, the sharing of gum from one mouth to another, the group resentment of those who have not been through the hell that they have been though, the appreciation of a piece of music that will relieve them of thinking of their situation for only a moment. It is these moments in the film that elevates the movie beyond a regular war film into a classic that other films will be measured against. I have seen "Ryan" four times now and it has not failed to generate a strong emotion in me every time. There are no heroics in this film. There is only an accurate display of humans, placed in a situation that is beyond belief, who do things because they have to, not because they want to, and to they best they can without reward or commendation. Their only reward is survival.</fullReview>

The beginning and ending scenes at the graveyard also struck me as silly and preachy.

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of the most unforgettable movies that I have ever seen. This is very close in that respect to "Schindler's List". "Saving Private Ryan" is the only movie that I can think of that actually made me cry in the theater. I remember almost everything about that night. I remember sitting in a Metro Detroit movie theater watching "Saving Private Ryan" with some friends on opening night. My favorite memory of that night is when the movie ended. There was an older gentleman sitting in front of me and to the left. While the landing at Ohmaha beach scene was concluding, he was sobbing a great deal. When the other soldiers were joking about the term "fubar" he was the only one in the theater who understood it and he laughed loudly. When the old man salutes the flag he cried again. He sat through all of the credits, as did I. When he finally got up, he was wearing his uniform from WWII. That is who this movie was made for. It was made so that we would always those brave men who died for our benefit. It was made to educate us. This movie should be viewed. It is too powerful not to. Steven Spielberg did a superior directing job on this film. This is the BEST movie of 1998, and possibly the best of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film, don't get me wrong, but its plot wasn't developed to the point of caring. The movie seems to rely on the violence like a crutch. The characters are boring and winy, although I would be too if I had to risk my life for someone who doesn't want to go anyway because he's a "good guy". The final thirty or forty minutes of the movie almost makes the whole thing seem like a waste of time. It's a good movie, but could've suffered a much better plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid symbolism parallels history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene of a cowardly American soldier symbolizes the U.S.A. response to the desperate appeals for help from the European Jews which were being brutally destroyed by the Nazis. This passivism cost the lives of untold millions. You watch this scene and you wonder how in the world the U.S.A. could ignore these cries for help, knowing that innocent people were being murdered, and yet we did nothing! This lack of response was due to fear and refusal to act responsibly.The next scene is a death struggle between a Nazi soldier and an American Jewish soldier. The fight is to the death. This scene symbolically portrayed the reality of the Jewish people struggling to survive the Nazis attempt at trying to exterminate them. There would be many which the Nazis would kill, and the Nazis would simply get away with it until the world could no longer avoid the problem.These scenes were so masterfully created that they are perfect in the reality they portray as well as the symbolism of historical parallelism. I am so impressed with the genius of the creation and production of Saving Private Ryan. I wish it would be made required viewing and discussed as part of a curriculum for world history in schools and colleges.I love Saving Private Ryan and wish to thank every person involved in making the movie and presenting it to the world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I've ever seen. Not only because of it's story, but because it was acted very well. They made it look very realistic when they were fighting, and when they weren't fighting. I commend the actors for their great performances. Another thing that is great about this movie is that it never really died at any part and it always kept you wondering what would happen next. Also, I really enjoyed the score written by John Williams. It is, in my opinion, the best score ever written for any movie.There really isn't anything bad to say about this movie. It was very disappointing to see that this movie didn't win Best Picture, Best Actor, or Best Original Score at the Academy Awards, which, I believe, it deserved. For those who haven't seen it, go rent it. It's definitely worth it.</fullReview>

And the first thing that came to my mind was: "my name is Forrest Gump...people call me Forrest Gump."Spielberg's casting of "Schindler's List" and "Amistad" was so much better. he should've taken a cue from two of his own movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that's so good, it's difficult to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that is so realistic that you may find it difficult to watch. It is possible to get so emotional that you want to close your eyes or cover your ears. But you don't. You are drawn into the film like into a miniature black hole. [By the way, does anybody know what the D in D-Day stands for? The answer is at the end of this review.]There are so many other well-written reviews of this movie that I am going to keep this short. I have a question though. Does Tom Hanks ever star is a bad movie? The answer is no, providing that Steven Spielberg directs.This is a exceptionally good and realistic war movie. My father served in World War II, but it was difficult for me to realize his sacrifice. Not after this movie it isn't. It is so vivid that there might be a new warning label coming out. Perhaps something like, ED (Watch out! Can cause emotional distress if you were there.) The almost noiseless sound of the bullets hitting soldiers or sand is unforgettable. Perhaps even haunting. It is not difficult to understand how some veterans sought professional help after viewing Spielberg's latest masterpiece.Well, I guess you have waited long enough. Nobody should have to actually read one of my reviews. The D in D-Day stands for Day. I had trouble believing my father when he told me that. Yes, and the H in H-Hour stands for Hour. See this movie if you dare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra updated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is wonderfully developed, while the action sequences are second to none. But ultimately "Saving Private Ryan" is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered. The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful. You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice. Just throw the bodies out there. In Kosovo we held that number to zero. Such a lovely way to fight a war. In WW II the number was, however many it took. Says something. Spielberg makes this point with the wide-angled shot of the channel filled with Allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can see-a scene incidentally right out of Frank Capra's seminal series "Why We Fight" to which this film is indebted whether Spielberg knows it or not.World War II was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really don't understand it or comprehend it. Spielberg thought he was being "objective" in showing war "as it really was," with Americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance (something Capra of course was not able to do). Yes, but to show the "saving grace" of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system, because that valor is a fraud. It was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war. Just as it didn't matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft, it was the sheer volume of them that prevailed.I think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war. Spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war, but while plying the trade he knows so well (seducing the audience) he has trumpeted the glory of war, that old fraud, and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers, only more skillful.Still it is impossible to say what is right. If we had not won WW II the world today would be vastly different. Totalitarian, imperial, repressive, racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed. They may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence. Who knows? Thank God for the United States and its incredible industrial capacity, because that is what won the war, not individual heroics, much as our tribal minds, along with Spielberg's, would like to believe such fairy tales.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! It was one of Steven Speilberg's greatest films that he has ever done. Just the way that his trademarks were so visible, it was fantastic. The start was nothing that I had ever expected. I was told how real it was, but I just couldn't believe it. It was like he was actually at the beaches on D-Day filming the battle. He didn't hold back on anything in the way that the battles were done or how real he showed the shots and the gun fire. I was almost getting sick because of the D-Day battle. He was having them get shot the second they opened the doors for them to get off the boat. Anyways, I think that Steven Speilberg is a fantastic director and a brilliant human being. And it is displayed in this film.</fullReview>

If you don't agree with me, than why is it that a good percentage of the movies that he's directed so far have been nominated, or in some cases have won the Oscar for Best Picture. Even if they're nominated, and don't win, that just means it pretty much cleaned up a lot of the earlier Oscar subjects.I still don't see why Shakespeare in Love won for Best Picture.

		<fullReview>Normally I do not like war movies, but I watched Saving Private Ryan and loved it! It deserves to be among the top 250 movies. The story is loosely based on a true story of The Sullivan Brothers. There were five brothers that were all put aboard a ship, the ship sunk and they all died in the same day. Imagine how devastating that must have been to that family. Because of the Sullivan Brothers there has been a law passed that siblings cannot serve on the same vessel. My father -in-law was a pilot and the only son during the Korean war. He was a volunteer! His plane crashed on U.S. soil. My husband is the soul survivor and he was then seven months old. My mother-in -law heard the news on the radio. Imagine how devastating that must have been. My husband makes miniature model airplanes. We have quite a collection of those cute little planes. Every airplane is well researched as my husband goes to National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. He is very interested in the Pacific Theater - a war buff! He also corresponds with several veterans. It is really adorable. He loves war movies. I tend to fall asleep watching them, unfortunately, but I try to stay awake and understand. We have a good collection of famous war movies, educational videos etc. I purchased Saving Private Ryan along with a very romantic movie, because I thought: I am sure that I will doze off! But no! I watched the entire thing and loved it! Let me tell you why I loved it: (1) There is no unnecessary use of curse words. They are used properly there are no exaggerations! I watched "Full Metal Jacket," I know that those guys curse but every word in that movie is "F word!" I hated it. (2) Then the painted faces. They scare me to death! I know it is a form of camouflage but I still get scared. That is what scared me the most in "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon." (3) I understood the story in this movie and it is moving. It is nice story telling. Going back in time. Private Ryan being such a nice person makes the movie even better! I liked two war movies so far, this one and "A Midnight Clear." I must understand the point. Just plain violence does not cut it! People say but that is how war is. Well, I want to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil. I can only take so much. I did not have to go to war. It is just a movie. I do not want to be traumatized all at once in one movie! (4) I don't like the over emphasis on the use of drugs in movies like "Platoon"either. There is nothing like that in Saving Private Ryan. That is why I love it! My favorite scene: at the end of the movie cemetery, the camera pans and there are all those white crosses: I felt that we are all Private Ryan because those soldiers fought for our freedom. Most of us enjoy such freedom undeservingly. But they died for us all. My favorite quotes: " All four were in the same company, but after we split them after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juno." Ryan: " Tell her that when you found me, I was here and I was with the only brothers that I have left".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bloody Beach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene which opens "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the great sequences in movie history. Why? Because it is the most realistic modern battle sequence ever filmed. Why? Well I'll try to explain....1. Other war films have a camera that moves smoothly in straight horizontal or verticle paths. When the camera does not move it is completely motionless. In SPR there is never a time when the camera is not jumping up and down, peeking around obstacles, running along the beach with the men, ect. A relatively motionless camera reduces the tension and the realism. The shutter film was a nice idea too.2. The sound is incredible. Explosions to the left and the right, bullets whizzing by hitting sand, obstacles and men, Tom Hanks shouting but you still cant hear him very well because of all the loud noise - all add to the realism.3. Blood and gore. In a real battle, people get shot. When they get shot they bleed. Sometimes they lose limbs. Sometimes their guts spill out. Theres plenty of that in SPR.4. Bullet hits. Everywhere ya look there are bullets hitting water, sand, men - you name it.Some movies have one but not the rest. Some have'em all but not enough of each. NO movie has em like SPR.</fullReview>

You "experience" Private Ryan. From the beginning to the very end of the show, you are hopelessly attached to your newly acquired best buddies in the world who are real people with fears and aspirations and attitudes and personalities and everything. This is not the G.I.Joe hero story where the good guys always just manage to not get shot. This is war, as real as I can imagine it: up close and very, very personal. If you have served our country, thank you for whatever it is that you did FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. If you know somebody that was in a war, especially WW II, please go and experience this movie.

		<fullReview>Alright, this one definately one of the best films of 1998, and contained some of the most harrowing, frightening, and realistic battle footage ever filmed. Now I saw it the day after it was released, before ANY hype had touched this film. This film was so over-hyped, it became sickening. Another thing that's so annoying is that people are calling this "the greatest war or anti-war movie ever made." It is may be one of the best, but is isn't in the same ballpark as some of the others. This film is meant to show the horrors of war through battle and carnage. Yes that is one way to show it, but the more "anti-war" style to show it is to show more humanity and suffering, like "The Killing Fields" (the best anti-war film) or "Born On the Fourth Of July" (even "Platoon"). But because of hype, it has the look of an action blood-and-guts type of film. The video stores are categorizing this under ACTION. ACTION. The film had a weak script, but still a story to buoy the film, and an annoying, overly patriotic, beginning and ending, which did play a toll on the film. For a second, you might even think it glorified war. But nevertheless, it is mostly overlooked because of the intensity But these people who call this "the greatest war film ever" complain about this year's other war companion "The Thin Red Line." it was so different from this, taking a different and interesting approach to "war is hell" and was a great film, but obviously, flopped. Thank god hype didn't kill that. But nevertheless, this is still on my top 5 list of 1998 and is worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing first half hour. How could anyone think of war as glorious after seeing that. There are so many fine touches in camera-work and direction that you need to see to believe - the sheep wandering past the unit, the homely sandwiches and so on. So clever to have the rescue unit itself hostile to the rescue - after all, each son who died left a mother bereft, and that is what Ryan himself felt at the end of the film. It is such a shame that the last half hour of the film became a conventional war movie. Spielberg has made a great movie - in parts greater than anything that has ever been made about the Second World War. But his last half hour is an indulgence which lets the rest of the film down. Nevertheless, my father joined the (British) Royal Marines in February 1939 and fought throughout to May 1945, including the Normandy landings. For the first time on screen I have now seen something like what he must have gone through. How did our parents/grandparents do it? And aren't we so lucky that we have not had to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess when you're Steven Spielberg no one ever second guesses you. This is what I was thinking after the lights came on and I left the theater. How else could those cemetery scenes have gotten into the movie? Wasn't there someone who could have told him that those were horrible scenes? War veteran, with his sons, daughters, and barbie-doll grandchildren visits Arlington Cemetery and asks his wife if he's lived a good life. I had to look away. It was the most cheesy thing I had ever seen. I felt embarrassed for Spielberg. I thought the scene at the end of Schindler's List was pretty cheesy ("how many more could I have saved, had I sold this car?"), but this was infinitely worse.Aside from those scenes (and the one with Lincoln's letter...), the movie is okay. It suffers from a weak screenplay, but the action sequences are the grittiest, most realistic, and overall most effective I've ever seen. The cinematography is dazzling, the sound is perfect, and the images horrifyingly real. You'll grip the armrests and live the fear.But I don't think this movie is deserving of all the praise that's been heaped on it. It will show you, realistically, the horrors of war - and perhaps that's worth a pat on the back for Spielberg. But it could have been better. It could have been much, much better - if only it had a good plot and some real character development!Definitely worth seeing, but not the greatest war movie ever.One more thing - The Thin Red Line was overshadowed by the success of this movie, but was very different and very good.

		<fullReview>Anyone who comments on this movie as being "too graphic", "lacking in character development", or as having "scenes that could be cut" is missing the entire point of the movie. While we sit here in the 1990s, in a comfy movie theater watching a fictionalized version of the horrors of the taking of Omaha Beach, there were hundreds of young men barely past high school age who had to LIVE IT. To say that a scene was too graphic is to belittle the men who had to witness it first hand and did not have the option of turning off the VCR or leaving the theater. Sometimes, a movie is supposed to make us think. Sometimes things are not always laid out for us--we have to pick them up ourselves. And finally, bravo to Spielberg for making one of the few truly honest war pictures ever. War is not pleasant. It is not about this super-human nobility and clean victory. No matter which side "wins", everyone loses. This movie made me think long and hard about what people my age (20) had to go through just 50 years ago. When I saw this film in the theater, I was surrounded by members of the WWII generation, and I could see in their eyes that this was almost too real for them. The ability to create a movie that makes a 20 year old girl in 1999 feel like she was at Normandy in 1944 is an epic talent that should be cherished. "Saving Private Ryan" is beyond a 10. Anyone who doesn't see that should really watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It obvious this is a great movie that I don't even need to talk about. The fact that Shakespeare in Love won best movie over SPR is absurd! SPR shows all of us that have never been in war the psychological and physical hardships our national heroes endured. This movie helped fathers and sons understand each other. Shakespeare is a good movie but that's all it is. SPR is a historical masterpiece that will be shown every Vereran's day so that future generations will understand what these men did for their country. Let's see who remembers Shakespeare in 2 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War, What is it good for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is worthy of the Oscar acclaim that it received. The opening D-Day scene will turn your stomach with cinematography that seems to come very close to reality. I read one comment that said, "Sure, it depicted what war is like, but we all know what war is like already." What a slap in the face this kind of thinking is to the men and women who have actually stood in the line of fire. No one can know what war is like, unless they've actually been there. If you have never experienced war firsthand, and the good lord willing, will never experience it, then this movie may be the closest thing in depicting what it would be like.  As far as the movie's premise, I took a class in college once called "Modern War and Morality". In this class we pondered the same issues that are discussed by the soldiers in this movie. In one scene, Hanks says every person that you kill, you have to consider it 20 lives saved, at least he says, that is how you have to think. Some people would call it rationalizing an irrational act. Well, this movie is full of these philosophical dilemmas.  And while I have heard some people call the bookend gravesite scenes corny and unneeded, I think they add a great touch to the movie. James Ryan could be any WWII vet, reminiscing on gruesome times, and great friends and relatives lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After making such inexcusable trash as The Lost World, Spielberg just can't be taken seriously (neither can Tom Hanks, after Forrest Gump), no matter how hard he tries. And in his most recent attempt at redemption, he doesn't succeed in the slightest: He simply cannot refrain from being the typical Spielberg with his heavy-handed, lofty and ultimately sappy direction. The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as Reality :the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I coudn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowdpleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to "keep it real", you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. If all the obvious false-note subplots that make this a Spielberg vehicle would be removed (Hanks' trembling hand, the German prisoner's hysterical clowning, one of the privates' "symbolic" confrontation with the enemy as a Jew, and so on), SPR's level of realism would have been consistent enough to allow for it's now-classic status. The main reasons to view this film, of course, are the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the Wild Bunch). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and simultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind. The last one,(a small group of men versus a veritable army - hmmm,where have I seen THIS before?) is almost as good, if not for the cheap Hollywood trick at the very end, which finds the movie venturing into Indiana Jones territory. It almost seems that SPR was directed by TWO different people: Spielberg and his WWII battle consultant. On the very primal level, however, the film achieves at least one of its makers' many aspirations: when I exited the theatre, I felt lucky to be alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me consider the sheer brutality and terror of warfare in a way I had never done before. It did this by placing me in the middle of the battle while at the same time enjoying the comfort of a cinema seat. I realised in a way I had never accepted before the horror of the D-Day landings, and the courage of each and every man who didn't just lie down and play dead as soon as they (and if they) set foot on the beach, which is probably what I would have done.It made me think in a way that no other film has done. I cam,e away reminded of the sacrifice that was made so that we can live in freedom today. It reminded everyone that WWII wasn't the neat and tidy war that it sort of gets remembered as. I was moved to tears, and I'm not even an American (the Brits landed too, by the way).But that small issue aside, this film made me think more than any other film has ever done; not just a war film, but any film. It is, to me, the most important movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the day it opened not knowing much about it beforehand. I was really blown aray. This was without a doubt, the most realistic portrayal of war I've ever seen in a movie. The D-Day re-enactment alone is one of the most powerful scenes ever put to film. This movie is the flip side of those glamorized Hollywood John Wayne movies from the 40's. And the scary thing is, as real it it looked, it's still probably not as real as it actually was.I'd never seen an audience so silent leaving a movie theater before. I left that theater with a new appreciation for the people who fought and died in World War II. I recently gathered up the courage to see this movie a second time when it came out on video and it lost none of the emotional imact it had on me the first time. A true mark of a great film. In the summer that gave us "Godzilla," "Armageddon" and "The Avengers," this movie was a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is No Poetry in War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War is an ugly, brutal contest in which humans actions speak louder than any words. This point has been made to me time and time again by combat vets who have related thier experiences to me. Soldiers do not speak in metaphors, do not act as if they have P.H.D.'s in philosophy, and do not wonder what the last artillery barrage meant to the world at large. They worry about themselves, thier buddies, thier families back home. They smoke to break the long periods of boredom and to relieve the tension of the few moments of the most extreme stress any human can face. They talk about getting sleep, hot food, a good, long bath with soap, and clean underpants. They worry constantly in the cold, wet winter climates of getting trench foot and/or frostbite. And they worry about malaria and dysantary in the hot, wet summer climates. In the end, the combat soldier wants to get the job done, go home, and try to forget. All these factors were captured brilliantly in Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan". Never has a more realistic war film been made. Only Steven Spielberg has the clout to break away from the Hollywood formula of heroics (or the Hollywood formula of the "art" war film) and present war, in this case World War II, in all it's brutal ugliness and do justice to all combat vets. Although the story in "Saving Private Ryan" is excellent, it is apparent that the story is not that important. It's not so much what is said between the soldiers but what is seen. This is a very visual film and perfect for Spielberg as he is a very visual director. Tom Hanks is perfect in the role of Captain John Miller, a perfect portrayal of the "everyman" combat soldier, someone who can as easily be believed as a teacher in Pennsylvania as being asked to carry a Thompson sub-machine gun and kill Germans. Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath, Captain Miller's tobacco chewing NCO, is convincing as a combat soldier who knows his tactics and is the work horse leader of the squad. Sizemore is also able to give the impression that he knows his tactics because he's learned the hard way. Which is one of the subtle underlying tones of the film, that none of the G.I.'s in the squad is a professional soldier. They all know what they know about tactics and survival because of hard experiences. No other Hollywood war film I can think of has ever captured this idea, the idea that American G.I.'s are, by and large, citizen soldiers who are tasked with performing a job and going home. For those who doubt that this is the most realistic war film ever made, allow me to quote the answer of an American World War II combat vet who, when asked what was it about "Saving Private Ryan" that brought back the memories, he said "the sound of the (German) Tiger tanks. I don't know how Spielberg did it, but the noise of the Tigers moving around was exactly what it sounded like. You never forget that sound." There is no poetry in war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extraordinary Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually war films don`t appeal to me, but Steven Spielberg's latest hype-drenced film, "Saving Private Ryan", did look like a remarkable film, so I watched it. I have to say, from beginning to end, I could not take my eyes off the film for one second, it was absolutely compelling, almost in a a surreal way. I have never seen such a film as this one, Steven Spielberg triumphantly proved to the world once again after "Schindler's List", just what a phenomenal director he is, it totally baffled me how he could of crafted such a physically and emotionally complicated with virtual flawlessness. There are two major battle scenes , one in the beginning and one in the end, and they are both extremely harrowing. The first one burns with unflinching realism, you almost feel like you`re right there with the soldiers instead of watching them on a screen. It shows just how terrifying the war really was, every form of anihilation and destruction is captured on film. The second one is a bit more sombre, mainly because the audience has gotten to known the main characters, and after witnessing some of their deaths, our feelings and sympathy and sorrow are evoked. The performances given by Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, and the rest of "the crew" (Forgot their names, but are all enormously talented) are all exceptional. They all have diverse personalities, but when they put in serious situations, we powerfully sense their shared emotions of instinct, terror, longing and grief. "Saving Private Ryan"'s power comes mainly from it`s clear moral, as it proves just how tragic the war really was, and the devastating impact it had on the world and humanity. The story may be fictitious, but the movie still enables us to have a pretty good idea of the savage violence that rampaged the earth during the wars, all while asking the ulimate question; Was there any reason AT ALL why this had to happen? It was a question that lingered in my mind for days afterwards. "Saving Private Ryan" is a truly extraordinary film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, before I get to my complaints, let me say that this is a fairly well-made, entertaining movie. Spielberg puts together a good flick, though I still maintain he has not achieved the status of Hitchcock or Kubrik. The battle scenes were fantastic and by far the most realistic that I have ever seen (not including The Thin Red Line). Anyone who thinks that Normandy was a glorious day should watch this film (which depicts the landing of the U.S. Army Rangers near Omaha beach, one of the most hellish fights in army history). And I do have to say that the cast was one of the greatest ensemble casts ever made. The scene where Hanks reveals who he his to stop a quarrel is just fantastic.Now, having said that, this is NOT the greatest war movie ever made, as some have proclaimed. For one thing, I just find it patently ridiculous that a platoon of soldiers would be sent deep within enemy lines to save one guy. Maybe that kind of stuff happened, maybe not, but I find it very implausible. Unfortunately, a movie with a bunch of guys roaming the European theatre fighting Germans would have been worse. Another thing - one more role with a pompous Tom Hanks and I will vomit! He's a good actor, to be sure, but jeez. And Matt Damon's performance did not impress me either.That's my story and I'm sticking to it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like anyone else I was not only spellbound but also made very uneasy by the opening scene. There was a specific part of that scene that I have never witnessed in a war movie before, one of stark realism that I can attest to because of a tour in Vietnam. As the landing craft begin to lower their ramps there is the vision of many of the men being cut down by German machine guns ashore. I say "vision" because you don't hear the sounds of the guns as you would in the average war movie. Instead what you hear is the sound of the rounds striking the men and the sides of the craft. This fits with the very real tenet that you never hear the one that gets you. Obviously because of the speed of sound you take the hit before you hear the report providing you're lucky enough to hear it and if you do is not a loud report, rather a sometimes faint one depending upon the distance of the shooter from your position. I have heard leaves all around me being clipped by enemy fire and can honestly say I don't recall hearing the shots responsible. This is the realism that Spielberg provided during that scene and it was a bit unnerving. Later in the film I noticed that after the firefight at the radar station where the American medic was killed, the same number of GI's are seen walking across a field as had walked across another field prior to the contact. This obvious editing mistake was actually good for me because it put the movie in its proper perspective, the fact that that was what it was; a movie. Considering the fact that the rest of the thing was brutally realistic I was glad to have had that little error to fall back on. Otherwise I might have been tempted to believe that it wasn't just a movie at all. My opinion of this film, one of the best of all time if not the top. I can watch it several times and I will.</fullReview>

Coppola/Stone/Kubrick lovers. Both camps will find fault with this movie, but an open mind will really appreciate what Spielberg achieved with this film. The action in the first half-hour is top notch. You will not find action of this kind in any war movie to date. Now we come to the plot. War films and plots are usually blurred or non-existent (unless they are non-fiction/attempted true to life films). In this case we have a fictional story with a plot. Compared to Platoon and FMJ, this movie HAS a plot. The movie has peaks and valleys, as do most films. That is how one builds a climax. The hype of this film has jaded many to believe that you can achieve 2 hours and 49 minutes of intensity to match D-day. Spielberg captures peaks and valleys of soldier combat. It's intense battles with a lot of boredom.to sum it up:Patton: better character developmentPlatoon: uses personal experience to judge a period of time, too much bias to show one side of Vietnam. Deer Hunter makes Platoon look weak.FMJ: Characters a bit disjointed, realistic combatThe Longest Day: a puff piece, the only redeeming aspect is the German perspective.A Bridge Too Far: weak screenplay for a true to life drama, a good war film nonetheless</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only just seen this film on video for the first time and I must say that I regret not having seen it at the cinema (but after sitting through Schindler I was loathe to get an uncomfortable bum for a little bit more Spielberg self glory and pomposity). Except for a jingoistic 'America is the greatest land in the world' kind of attitude - I thought that this film stood head and shoulders above any other film of this genre and literally shot down The Longest Day as my classic WW2 movie.It is, as has been pointed out repeatedly in these comments, a very fine and realistic seeming drama. OK so the plot is thin and intentionally narrow minded but what Hollywood movie isn't at the moment and It was refreshing to see the characters in the film moaning about how ludicrous and shallow their mission (and therefore the plot line) was, but in Ryan, the weak plot is it's grace. The sheer waste of life and time hits you very hard and it is the documentary of war-time which comes at you like a screaming fury and provokes a huge emotional reaction which (I'll wager I'm not alone) had me discussing WWII, 20th Century politics and war in general for quite a few days.Yes, it may have been based on a real-life story. Yes the historical representation may have been unnervingly accurate. Yes the Omah Landings did prove costly (the artillery bomardment and armour landings failed to materialise - Not surprising from the American Armed Forces.) and yes, a great number of very brave men died. What got to me though was the huge pointlessness of the fight. Who was actually saved? Ryan - certainly not emotionally. The war-torn lands of France - not in the film. The American or even, come to that, the poor German soldiers who had to obey orders which did not take into account their humanity - not if the ketchup was anything to go by. Not even Hanks, Spielberg et al were saved the misery of Shakey in Love picking up their beloved Oscars.But the direction of the piece, the cinematography, the initial landing scene (grainy and with fantastic sound and visual effects) will stay with me for a long time to come.Spielberg has once again shot up in my estimation and it was pleasant not to have his own insecurities and pats on the back so prevalent in one of his films. I even hear that the next "Jews during the war" movie (The Betty someone Story) may not even be directed by him but may go to the Bard Branagh instead. But here he has at last come of age in the realms of adult drama and serious film-making.</fullReview>

Merely on the merits of the film's first half hour, SPR will deservingly have an important place in film history.And although I think the movie was great, a couple things about it fell just a little short:1) The contrived bookending sequence with the old man at the cemetary. Wouldn't the story have been just as powerful if told entirely during the war? 2) The script was good, but it pales in comparison to the directing, cinematography, and acting.This movie had such high ambitions, that it was disappointing to not see Spielberg reach them entirely.

		<fullReview>This is not a film for the melancholic.Sure it has great special effects. There's more blood and guts to be found here than in your average war movie, and if you've become accustomed to watching NATO missions on CNN or on the 'net this might just bring to mind the fact that in war there is suffering, no matter what the technology used. In this respect, the sound effects are particularly poignant.But there are two scenes in particular which brought me a cold sweat. In one a German soldier, and in the other an American, find themselves in a situation where death at the hands of the enemy is now inevitable. For each, the only remaining option is to beg for mercy, and hope that their communications are understood. But what brings out pathos in the viewer wins little understanding from these soldiers. Therein lies the most gruesome message of all; in war these men have lost the ability to treat others as humans. This contrasts sharply with what we learn of their private lives prior to the start of the war.The cinematography is excellent. Just as the beach scene (filmed in Ireland) receives acclaim for its realism, the scene on the bridge is filled with tension as the soldiers await the arrival of the tanks. It's "High Noon" with Tom Hanks in the role of the sheriff.Private Ryan plays little role in the film. Perhaps this is why some commentators have said the film lacked depth. They wanted to see how Mrs Ryan was feeling at home. To them I say "go watch a Lassie movie"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw SPR on video last night. What a valiant attempt by Spielberg to realistically depict the sacrifices of the allies during the Normandy invasion and its near aftermath! This is almost a great movie. I had trouble hearing some of the dialogue, and granted some of the scenes seemed a bit trite, but mostly this film succeeded. I'm also sorry that Blacks and Hispanics were not included. Yes, the Germans were portrayed as being brutal, particularly Steamboat Willie, but on the other hand there were also scenes where Americans ruthlessly shot surrendering Germans. It just goes to show that war really is hell!None of the comments that I read here focused on the Lincoln letter which General Marshall quotes by heart in the early part of the film, and later incorporates into a final letter to Mrs. Ryan. I found this to be extremely effective in establishing the overall theme, which was the sacrifice of our fathers (grandfathers, uncles, etc) on the "altar of freedom." In the end, it was not the brutality of war, but the self-giving sacrifices of the WWII generation which is the main point of SPR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly numbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scary film. The landing scenes were so "real", I was left cold. Is this what war is really like? I personally think that soldiers who worry as much about what's happening around them as these guys did, do not last long.The acting is not important - how can one who has never experienced war produce the necessary emotions, or lack of them? The effects are good, not too flashy to let you relax, yet strong enough to shock you. The movie seems overlong, though, as the search for Ryan continues. A lot of the dialogue there seems superfluous - a better director might have used less talking and more expression to convey the same emotions. Unfortunately, there was little attempt at developing the characters beyond the basic stereotypes, so their fate does not matter much, in the end. Still, a modern audience may need that statement of the obvious to get the point.Do I recommend this movie? If you have not seen a war movie before, do so - any attempt at illustrating the "realities" of war is commendable. However, if you have seen other war movies, save yourself the time. The movie is too long, and despite a terrifying start, fails to engage you in the long run. Watch it on video...I rate: 2.5 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A master class in filmmaking, this contains some of the most brilliantly executed battle sequences ever made. This is one of those rare films that aren't afraid to depict battle in a very realistic manner, managing to show how people can die such senseless and horrible deaths. There is one particular sequence at the beginning of the movie that really numbs you.As an example of the futility of war, it certainly delivers, and the plot concerning saving Private Ryan really concerns the Tom Hanks character, for he is the one who needs saving. The film does have flaws in its narrative, and the middle section is possibly 20 minutes too long, but, taken as a whole, the film is quite an achievement, and surely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. When viewed on video, the one major aspect that will be missed is the ultra realistic sound effects that manage to add a whole new dimension to the battle scenes, making you feel as if you are really there.While this isn't Spielberg's best film, technically it is his most accomplished, and is an example of a filmmaker nearing the peak of his creative abilities. At the Oscars, Spielberg's face said it all - this deserved Best Picture.9/10.</fullReview>

The opening scene (D-Day) was amazing, it gave the audience a really good idea of what these young soldiers had to go through on that day of June 6 1944. I really think that kids now days should watch this movie and maybe then they'll realize that so many young men had died to give them their freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We live in an age where war is not fashionable and Old Glory has not the respect it once did. This movie begins and ends with a shot of the American flag looking as if it had been washed in hot water instead of sent to the dry cleaner.A woman has three sons killed in action virtually simultaneously. Army policy is that, in such a situation, the sole surviving son - Private Ryan - be discharged. Unfortunately, Ryan parachuted behind German lines the day before D-Day. The Army Chief of staff meets with his wogs. Some seem concerned about bad PR if all the sons die. Some see the rescue mission as suicide.This may be a violent "war" movie but it is also a story about the decision to do what is right - saving Private Ryan whatever the cost may be.War is a duplicitous adventure. Men do good things for bad reasons and bad things for good reasons. Sometimes its hard to tell the two apart.The lead character, played by Tom Hanks, tries to do what is right. In the "fog of war" some die and some good is done. Maybe that's what war is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" has several very intense and touching scenes. The first half hour is, for instance, a movie classic already. However, having not seen this movie on the big screen I guess I don't look upon these thirty minutes the way many other people do. For me they are only intense -- like so many scenes in so many films.On the whole, "Saving Private Ryan" is far from a masterpiece. It is very well-made and rather interesting, but not much more. I still enjoyed it though, even if I think "Glory" and a few other films are much better war movies.And as for the Academy Awards this year, I consider it to be a scandal that "Shakespeare in Love" won the Best Picture award, SPR is at least somewhat better than that film, it's just as strange as the fact that Edward Norton didn't win the Best Actor award.So, this film is far from a masterpiece, but I still appreciate the fact that SPR is well-made and interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm only 12, and my mom didn't like me watching Saving Private Ryan- because of all of the graphic violence. But just think about it, this film was so realistic, I'd see what happened sooner or later in a film in school. Except the fact that what I'd see in school would be what REALLY happened.It also shows that you may be at war with a country- but you don't just wanna kill. It wasn't just like the United States sent in some bad ass UDT team of 8, and whooped Hitler's army. People actually died from the U.S., and they showed them on the beach of Normandy just laying there while being shot at from machine guns on hill sides. It just didn't seem chee-z compared to like some Delta Force movies I've seen, where a guy is left behind, so they jump 50 feet into a helicopter throw the guy out and luckily they have rope, or the tie something to the yoke to make it not move and they go down and rescue 'em. Or someone gets shot in the chest once and dies, while some other dude gets shot like 50 million times and ends up beating the other side.</fullReview>

The gut wrenching effects and the horror in the faces of the soliders are endearing images in my mind that I'll never forget.How some people can say the performances are weak is absurd. Tom Hanks gives one of his best, as with Ed Burns. I've also heard complaints that the movie falls apart after the opening scene, with which I disagree.

These men were brave. They are heroes. They have served this country with great pride. What is the point of risking the lives of eight to save one? What is the point of saving any at all? Is your life worth less than the life of someone you've never met? These soldiers fought to save our country, and our freedom from the people that try to take those away from us. They fight so that they can save the lives of others. We are the others. To the mother that has lost 3 of her 4 children, her last surviving son is in that category. These soldiers fought to save one man. That was their duty. As captain John Miller said to his soldiers, "If that gives me the right to go back to my wife," he knew it was his duty to save this man. His job is to save as many lives as he can and one life of private Ryan should not be ignored. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10, and only 2 movies have got this rating on my list.

		<fullReview>When I got to the theater to see this "Saving private Ryan", I hadn't yet seen "Schindler's list" and thought it was pretty good and that it would win a lot of awards at the Oscars. However, after having seen "Schindler's list", I understand why "Saving private Ryan" did not win best picture of the year."Saving private Ryan" is closer than a cool action movie than a heavy drama like "Schindler's list". Sure it's good, but it isn't the best movie of the year. I think that perhaps if Spielberg had cut out more of the action and gory scenes and had concentrated more on the fact that Mrs. Ryan would like to see her last son come home, it probably would have been a higher and better quality drama than it actually is.Although the opening on the beach of Normandie on D-day is pretty well shown, I think that there were a couple of scenes that could have been cut for example one of the soldiers looking around for his arm in a pile of others or the other soldier trying to keep all his intestines inside his body.All in all, it's a very good movie but it isn't even close to being nearly as good as "Schindler's list" (which probably explains why "Saving private Ryan didn't win best picture of the year).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very effective filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After scanning some of the other comments, I think I'm more disturbed by some of them than I am this film! First of all, the battle scenes are spectacular, particularly the invasion sequence. (None other than John Keegan, famed war historian, has said that it is as realistic as your going to find on film.) Some here have criticized it for being to "amero-centric" (I guess that's a word?) because the soldiers are all American. This is not a fair criticism -- the soldiers landing on Omaha and Utah beaches WERE all Americans. The other beaches, Gold, Juno, and Sword, were landed upon by British and Canadian soldiers mostly. If you're going to criticize a movie, do it for it is, not what it is not. Of course, many other nations participated in WWII, but because they're not seen does not invalidate this film. The men who landed at Omaha beach were by far the hardest hit. The Normandy battles were not as large as Kursk, for example, but celebrating one battle does not somehow invalidate the rest. Criticizing it for that is childish and petulant. The movie does slow a little in the middle, but I did not see any "mushy Hollywood" type movie making. Your stereotyped Hollywood picture has a big soundtrack and lots of gratuitous pyrotechnics -- this movie had none of that. I have often criticized some of Spielberg's films in the past, but I have none to offer this film. It's not perfect (no film is) but its very good. An indirect kudos to Stanley Kubrick, whose influence I saw in a couple of scenes. Maybe that's just me, but it seemed "Kubrickian" in a quiet, indirect sort of way.</fullReview>

All of it was true. The death, the destruction, the horror. Everything.The movie is quite remarkable. For nearly three hours it showed the basics and specifics of how the Allies and Enemies went at it in WWII. The enormous amount of losses at Normandy were all that sparked me in the movie. That is where I started remembering who was on that beach at the time, or who made it, or who didn't.The entire cast conducts an incredible performance. Hanks and Burns shine, Damon and Sizemore strike the screen with their emotions and thoughts, and Spielberg again amazes the world with his hard work and dedication toward the movie industry and the history of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb movie by Steven Spielberg, which almost, but not quite, fulfills all it's intentions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess you all know what it's all about, and you've heard about how real it is.Well, for me, it came across mostly as very realistic although the Omaha Beach landing was more a gorefest than great cinema. This might have been intentional, as the purpose probably was to shock the audience with the full horrors of war.Still this scene doesn't "do it" for me. Why? Because I've read so much about the D-Day and WWII that I know people died in droves (literally) on the beaches that day, such as they always do in war, only this was on a much greater scale. That same scale what is working against the scene because we don't know the characters involved and we do know that those we recognise(Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks for instance) will make it safely ashore as they have to go and find this paratrooper schmuck named Ryan. It is a good scene though, just not all that it was claimed to be.Ok, ok, I've rambled on about the landing, how about the rest of the film? Well, it starts off a bit slow, to allow the audience to get their breaths back from the opening 20 minute blood bath and to introduce the main characters to the audience. We are also introduced to the films moral dilemma, is it fair to risk the lives of nine men to save one, just because his three brothers have already died? What price are we prepared to pay and for what exactly are we willing to pay that price? The message is further emphasized by the losses incurred on our small group of heroes as they traverse the French countryside. The whole mission seems like a suicide, especially as nobody knows wether Ryan is still alive at all!And it's the final battle scene that really makes the movie for me. Because now it's man to man, you know the characters involved and you can see the fear in their eyes, and you can see the same fear in the germans' eyes.So it's really gritty and intense, and Spielberg has managed to capture all this with a really stunning and up-close photo. The cinematics are incredible, the shots are long with few cuts, just like in the old David Lean movies (Lawrence of Arabia, most notably). All this combines into one, long and really breathtaking battle. It would probably have been easier to start a real war and film that one instead than to shoot this battle scene. When I came out of the theater, my condition could only be described as "shell-shocked".Sadly, this is a movie which will lose a lot if seen on a TV. But see it anyway if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

No other nationalities apart from the Germans who are very cliched in this film very evil and cold blooded not human at all which even though they were on the opposite side they were human too just like the americans. I thought the way they were portrayed was very bitter and if youre going to make a good anti war movie you have to get across the message that war is futile and affects and hurts everyone not just one nationality that is why it is so pointless.

		<fullReview>This film truly moved and terrified me at the same time when I watched it at the cinema. Not many films can do that except for maybe Schindlers List. Recently I rented it but could only watch it until half way through the Omagh Beach scene. I think this film is the kind that you can only watch once. My Dad watched it and it moved him also, he even had tears in his eyes by the end of it. I can't believe that some war veterans involved in D-Day could actually begin to watch this film, it must bring back some terrible memories. I think it's something that we all should watch because it brings home the horrific nature of war that books and even pictures cannot even begin to illustrate. Most kids like me should definitely watch this as it makes us realise just how trivial our troubles in life seem. we should not be allowed to forget the millions of ordinary men who were slaughtered in this conflict, what they died for and just how lucky we really are. My only critcism of the movie is how like many Hollywood films only concentrate on the American side of it all when many other nationalities participated. Ok I accept that Omagh was a mainly American thing but even now the American soldiers are all portrayed as the good guys who can do no wrong and the Germans as inhuman monsters, take that bit at the end for example when the german stabs the american. What I think the film fails to illustrate is that even the Germans were just ordinary men just like the American soldiers with mothers and families and I think portraying all the german soldiers as pure evil is a bit outdated and sad we should realise that now. I also wish that this film could have been about and dedicated to all the men whatever their nationality who gave their lives on D-Day, it wasn't just the americans. Despite this however I think the opening scene is about as close as we can come to how D-Day actually was and i think its about time we knew what the war veterans went through for us and how eternally grateful we should be to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many young people had a grandfather that was in the war. I know he faced death many times but I don't know how many times or any of the details of his ordeal in WWII. He wouldn't ever talk about them, not even to my mother or her sister. Sometimes I could never understand that, but now I do. If this is really what it was like to be a soldier, no matter what war you are fighting, then it must be an incredibly difficult ordeal to drudge up memories that are this disturbing, this vivid and this real. I have never been to war and I hope to God that I never have to experience war, but after seeing this movie I believe I can tell you at least what it may have been like. This movie is that vivid and that honest.The first half an hour of this film is some of the most amazing direction I have seen in any film in my entire life. I have even read that Spielberg toned it down some. That is hard to believe knowing what is up there on screen.This film is brilliant in every capacity. The direction is so clear and crisp that you feel like you know these men when the film is over. You feel like you understand the war a little better than you did before. The acting is terrific. And not just Hanks and Damon, but everyone from Sizemore to Ribisi to the grunt that gets his guts blown out ( take your pick as to who that is. )I can't believe a film like Shakespeare in Love, a film that could have been an after school special, was chosen as best picture. Best picture? Over this? How is that possible? If you haven't seen this ( and there aren't many of you out there ) please do yourself a favour, see it tonight. It is such an amazing film and it is one that I will never forget.A final note: Even though my grandfather has been gone for about 8 years now, I salute him and every other guy that put it on the line and did so because they believed in what they were doing. I have a new understanding and appreciation for people like my grandfather. And that a film could make me feel that way is something special in itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up believing that the greatest silliness the Academy ever managed was naming Annie Hall "Best Picture" for 1977. The Academy Awards are trivial in the grand scheme of things, true, but when The English Patient swept a few years back, I allowed myself to be pulled back in. This brief period of interest in the Academy came to an abrupt end, however, last March. Not only was Ryan stiffed, but the Best Picture Award went to not even the next-best film. Shakespeare In Love pales next to Elizabeth, let alone the greatest war movie ever made. Yup, from now on I'll let my heart and head guide me...to hell with lists. This, of course, is not the greatest lesson one may glean from Ryan; in this age of reckless exposure it is truly satisfying to hear Tom Hanks say that the memories he has of his wife are his alone. Some things need to die with us, otherwise our lives are mere vehicles. Don't think that this movie falls to long, distancing reflections about intangibles--that was The Thin Red Line. Everything here is grounded in the mud, blood and rusty mechanisms of war. That Ryan anchors itself so firmly, yet still evokes such beauty is its greatest gift. Maybe that's what we have been looking for in war films all along...an angel that greets us during the massacre.</fullReview>

The invasion on Normandy was the best invasion ever captured on film. The finale at the end out matches the invasion on Normandy however: it is pure carnage: You can't help but say wow!. It is the fastest three hours I've ever spent in a movie theatre. it was acted brilliantly-- all of the actors deserved an oscar nod.-- Spielberg is a true genius at what he does-- he can't possibly out do himself.-- The most riveting cinematography ever.-- Cinematographer-- janusz Kaminski-- definitely deserved his oscar.-- The moving camera in the film makes it seem very realistic.

		<fullReview>This is the best war movie ever. It has to be one of the most powerful movies ever made. The D-Day re-creation at the beginning of the movie is the most stunning sequence ever to be put on film. I still have no idea how Steven Spielberg was able to pull it off. Tom Hanks turned in a great performance as the leader of the troop. The whole supporting cast was excellent, all worthy of an Oscar nomination. Along with "Schindler's List", Spielberg has made the two best movies of the 90's. Movies like "Platoon" and "Apocalypse Now" showed what it was really like in Vietnam. But now there is a movie that shows what it was really like at D-Day and WWII. It was robbed of a Best Picture Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Technically Brilliant Film with a Mediocre Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film in 1998 was more hyped by critics than this film. The First 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan does not disappoint. The editing, sound and camera work are so energized (combined with graphic violence) that the sense of being in battle is more real than any film I have seen. Also, Spielberg is the first director to use the grotesque violence of the Coen brothers and Tarantino in a war movie where it actually feels more natural. All of this makes for some very thrilling moments. But while Saving P. Ryan is a technical tour de force its script is not of the high standard as the rest of the film.The main story (let's find our guy) is routine for a war film. So, the development of the characters is very important to make the movie work. In this regard Saving Private Ryan for the most part was mediocre. I did not feel connected to most of these characters. There was too little dialogue for them to be real. Many war movies deal with the squad under pressure. Eight Iron Men (1952) comes to mind as doing a better job of showing how people cope with this.Saving P. Ryan also presents us with the horrors of war. The best movie to confront this subject is Apocalypse Now. Saving P. Ryan by contrast to Apocalypse Now seems to have its morality upside down. The most interesting character in the film, the interpreter, learns that the best thing to do with prisoners is to shoot them. There is no adequate comment on this brutality in the movie.The effectiveness of a final scene is essential for a high quality film and the one in Saving P. Ryan falls apart. The emotion shown by the actors works but the dialogue makes little sense as the final message of the movie. Because the film almost ignores the big picture about why we fought World War 2, it tries to make some sense of the loss of so many lives on an individual level, by private Ryan himself. This cannot be done. The justification of war, if any, is a cause for the greater good; i.e. ending slavery or stopping the Nazis. There is no other way to make sense of war and Spielberg should have used these issues.Saving Private Ryan got what it deserved at the Oscars; the award for best direction, editing and some technical awards. It is very well made but has a script with too many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming out of Saving Private Ryan, one detail was surprisingly clear. This is not as gruesome or violent a movie as most make it out to be. The violence occuring onscreen is realistic, but never is it gut-wrenchingly unbearable. For example, many images of soldiers being shot in the middle of their forehead look completely convincing, but at the same time are not disturbing. I suspect this is due to the fact that the violence itself is not gratuitous or dwelled upon for long periods of time. In Schindler's List, there is a scene were an old man is taken out of a line and has a gun pointed to his head by a German soldier, while the viewer gets a closeup of this cruelty. A couple of seconds pass where we just await the man to be shot dead. And it is in these few, passive seconds where the viewer is viscerally shaken because he or she has the preoccuring knowledge that the man is about to be killed. Whereas in Saving Private Ryan, every soldier is either shot down quickly, or the act of violence is not as closeup in the viewer's objectivity. The violence is not there to be just flat-out disgusting but to reflect upon its effect on the characters and the film's ideals. Although is this the film's virtue or disadvantage? Anyway the hype is undeserved. Never do you see a soldier's head blown away from his torso or the like. If you can handle award-winning pyrotechnics, then you can sit through this film. With that being said, perhaps something more important should. Saving Private Ryan just is not the best war film ever made, or even Steven Spielberg's best directing effort. It is bogged down by a number of cliches (it begins to rain right when our protagonists approach danger, one soldier accidentely reveals the enemy simply by sitting down, the band of soldiers is comprised of the usual wide-range of character types, etc). It lacks the thorough plot and execution of theme that Spielberg accomplished so easily and satisfactorily in his own Schindler's List. The tears and awe of the experience people had when they left the theater after that film was not there so much this time. Maybe that's the exact point the film is trying to get across, though. Perhaps its purpose (and only idea achieved) is to simply show that war is hell and what it is really like--to settle the look of the war film once and for all. If this was the movie's objective, then it does so in flying colors. But that's about all. The spiritual aspect is missing, and this is why the film could have been better. Schindler's List told the horrors of the Holocaust, but left the viewer with lasting images and lessons on basic humankind--the kind of secondary impression Saving Private Ryan lacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that when Saving Private Ryan came to the cinemas, I wasn't compelled to go see it. I usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it (read SW Episode One). Pvt. Ryan had been on the video shelves for a few weeks before I picked it up. I wasn't really looking forward to YAAWF (Yet Another American War Film).This film is absolutely brilliant filmmaking. If Speilberg had not made ET and Indiana Jones, he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece like this. He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the late 50's early 60's.This film is riveting from beginning to end. Every scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated with the overall artistic vision of the film. I have a degree in Film Criticism and have seen a lot of film. You quickly become jaded by formula after formula.Speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be considered a tired genre. The hand-held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the best in cinema history. The point, however, is not to bombard the viewer with gory war scenes for shock purposes. It is a setup for the rest of the film. You are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie. They payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the battle to hold the bridge.One beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing. That crossfade is a film convention that Speilberg subverts for dramatic effect. When you see the final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully done) it comes full circle. This subversion of a typical film convention is what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving. You'll know what I mean when you've seen it.Speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with intelligence, sensitivity and confidence.</fullReview>

He won my total respect with this film. The film is situated around 8 men trying to find Private Ryan. The reason why is because his 3 other brothers who went to the war all died in battle.

For those of us who have been there its like going back there.Hollywood has done veterans a great disservice by trying to make war look glorious and something to be desired. But as Private Ryan shows, war often provides individuals and groups the opportunity to rise to their finest moments while at the same time showing their darkest sides.War is not something to be sought after and Spielberg shows that lesson with great clarity.

		<fullReview>It's true, the first 45 minutes is the best part of the movie. The movie loses some of its realism later, starting with that ridiculously accurate shot by the American sniper to the German sniper. Then, during the last battle scene, the Germans look like they are TRYING to get killed. They don't hide behind stuff, but instead just run at the Americans. And Tom Hanks should play professional football with that incredibly accurate arm. Every one of those mortar shells he threw killed somebody.As for the demonization of Germans in the movie, I didn't see it. Many critics point out that "Steamboat Willy, toot toot" guy was an ungrateful b*****d and he was the only attempted German character development. The thing is, I didn't see him as evil and I don't think I was "supposed" to. He begged for his life, which is normal of anyone who thinks he is going to be killed, and he was released. So he ran into a German unit instead of an American one. They gave him a new rifle and sent him back to the front. That doesn't make him evil.Some foreign critics have criticized that there was no representation of the British and Canadians. If this was a documentary, I would whole-heartedly agree with this. However, this is a story of a group of American soldiers moving from one American occupied area to another. Why would this group run into British and Canadians who were further East?As for the critics that say this movie does too much "flag waving", I both agree and disagree. I did not see any real American patriotism being forced upon the viewer UNTIL that uncalled for flag scene and the very end of the movie.Still a good movie that will stick in your head for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no complaints of this movie, none at all. As I'm sure you know, the film is about a group of soldiers on a search for Private James Ryan, a man whose three brothers have been killed. The government wants them to save him because the mother will have lost all her sons if he dies. There's not really much else I can say about the plot because the movie doesn't really have one. Its whole purpose is to show what World War II soldiers went through, while throwing in a plot to keep the movie interesting. The war scenes are done very well, especially in the beginning and the end. They do a perfect job of showing the confusion and tragedy of war. The directing is very good and Steven Spielberg definitely earned his Oscar for Best Director. I have no idea how they made it look so real, and they managed to convey a real war atmosphere. One thing I noticed about this movie that only a few great movies have is the continuity and importance of each scene. No scene seemed unimportant, and each one I watched with full attention. There are never any unnecessary breaks and the movie as a whole has great continuity. Tom Hanks has always been one of my least favorite actors, because it seems like he plays the same character in all of his movies. But in Saving Private Ryan, he did a great job and I saw no resemblance to any other of his characters. One thing I also admired about him in this movie is that he never took attention away from any of the other actors. Everybody seemed equally important. Overall, this movie was superb. You should see it, it's practically your duty to. I felt bad because I never took Memorial Day or Veterans Day too seriously, but now I know I will. The least we can do is respect the soldiers who died for us and our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my view of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? The 25 or so minutes starting with the boats coming upon the shore of Omaha beach are 25 minutes that I will never forget. The carnage and desensitization of Tom Hanks is breathtaking.I tend to agree that the plot is very thin on this film, but its main redeeming value is how the traumatic events that occur in this film shape each character. Although everyone does an astounding job as far as the cast goes, Giovanni Ribisi embodies the WWII soldier the best. His portrayal as the medic is splendid, his performance makes his character seem as if he is the only one of the 8 soldiers with a shred of humanity left, telling the others to cover up the dog tags as a mass of soldiers march by, staring at the dog tags laid out across the table. His demise is all too real, it makes the viewer cringe because you feel for this character but you know there is nothing you can do to fend off the inevitable.Besides the very well choreographed battle scenes and the explosive acting job EVERYONE does, this film leaves alot to be desired. If the opening 25 minutes fail to quench your thirst of seeing humanity at its worst, then Full Metal Jacket surely will. Definitely not the best war movie of all time, although very close. If Full Metal Jacket had such brutally honest scenes of violence such as Saving Private Ryan when it came to the battle scenes instead of its glorified hollywood violence, it would reign supreme as the best example of war on film to date.My final thoughts: watch this movie if you want to be slapped in the face with the horror and tragedy American soldiers endured during WWII, but don't expect to be awestruck by the plot. The only downfall is that Saving Private Ryan did not portray that the war was equally as brutal for BOTH sides - with the exception of the scene where Captain Miller's group makes the lone German soldier dig graves for their fallen comrades. Was I the only one who didn't laugh at his last-ditched efforts to appease the Americans and make them spare his life? The final complaint would be that Spielberg did not tug at the strings of the viewers heart when the lead characters died - with the exception of Ribisi's character - whereas several scenes in 'Glory' brought tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

Whatever the war, whatever the cause. I couldn't give a hoot about the plotline, the acting, whether or not there were "typical war movie cliche`s". I wasn't watching it to compare it with Schindler's List, or even E.T. for that matter. I watched it with my two oldest children so that when I die and they inherit their grandfather's funeral flags, they'll know what those flags stand for. All the comments about comparing this movie to The Thin Red Line are silly. A war movie is to help those of us who weren't there understand those of us who were. Yes, war is hell. WWII was hell. Korea was hell. Vietnam was hell. The Gulf war was hell. If there were still any soldiers from WWI, they'd say the same. Movies like this are for the rest of us to remember why our people were sent in the first place. For this reason, this movie is required viewing. If you wonder why your grandfather doesn't talk much, or easily, about the time he served in WWII, this movie will explain it all. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

He did his "homework" and he did it very well. "Saving private Ryan", proves just that. Tom Hanks plays great. In the movie, he "used to be" a teacher, but now he is a captain, and he certainly deserves his rank. If, by any chance, you didn`t see this movie yet, you have no idea what you are missing. Rent it, buy it...totally regardless which one you choose cause you don`t loose. If you have a surround sound...you WILL feel every explosion, every shot, every scream...and you will definitely not stop until you have seen it all.I highly recommend this movie...in fact you can go strait out and buy it...add it to your collection...it will be one of your favorites!</fullReview>

It showed not only war, but human goodness. Eight men, men with lives and families, risk their lives to save the last of four brothers, they didn't know him, he wasn't important to them. They did it, for him and themselves. The stories told by Private James Ryan made him somebody to the soldiers, so that they fought for him after their duty of finding him was done. Told by the greatest teller of our time.The true feeling of the movie is belief. In people. Would I have done this? Would I have stayed for the final battle? Someone would. Someone did. Many.

		<fullReview>I saw this film the night it opened last Summer. I sat in awe for the entire film. It was amazing. So, when Harrison Ford read Shakespeare in Love off the Best Picture envelope, I was in shock. I had seen both, and I feel that SPR is so superior in every way. Shakespeare is a comedy with no real message or any quality that makes it eligible. I watched the film again when it arrived on video, and It affected me even more on video. I broke down during the end. The first 5 minutes of this film are some of the most powerful you will ever see. I doubt I will ever forget seeing a soldier searching for his arm on the ground, or a another, a intestine laying on the ground beside him, screaming mommy when he bled to death. These are the most amazing scenes ever shot. Even the Longest day's epic scale battles do not hold the same power. This film portrayed WW2 amazingly well. It was the first to really show the hell of it. The early films somewhat glorified it, this was the first to handle WW2 in a long time. Seeing it again, I realize it is easily the greatest film I have ever seen. The opening moments and the final battle will go down as some of the greatest battles ever filmed, as well as the most realistic. The Academy was wrong in choosing Shakespeare in Love. This film blew all the others away. I did see the Thin Red Line, which I consider to be the WORST film ever made. it is horrific. Even it's battle scenes don't affect as the characters are so dispicabule. Private Ryan is amazing, and will be remebered as the most powerful film of the last 40's years. A triumph of film making.</fullReview>

The brutality of warfare presented in SPR was so realistic that it made me cry, and I never, ever cry at movies.I could go on and on about how great this film is but I believe that it is to great to be completely explained in just a few words.

Ranks up with "Hard-Boiled" and "The Killer"! Rent this one at all costs! Remember though: GRAPHIC VIOLENCE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A graphic depiction of war throught the eyes of the soldiers involved.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was interesting and profoundly impacted all those in the theatre who saw it.Some will use this as an excuse of why not to go to war without realizing that what we went to war for (or to prevent) was far worse.It was interesting that after the credits started to roll and people were exiting, there was no chattering. Most people were silent and apparently contemplative.As someone said, "War is Hell" but we don't go to war for its "namby pambyness".We go to war for reasons that are not dealt with in this film except in a very cursory manner (see for example the scene of the soldier showing the Star of David and saying "Judem" over and over to the POW's.Hopefully we will not have to use this film in another war;no one in his or her right mind wants one. It is however necessary to realize that ideals are worth fighting and dying for and this film dealt only with the dying part of the equation, touching very little on the ideals that these men were fighting for.Still in all, a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gave me an understanding of what war is really like. Unlike other hollywood war movies, this movie provided in unflinching detail the horrors of war in a very intimate way. Only one other movie had similar impact on me and that was Platoon.It seems to be the consensus among many, if not all, SPR viewers that the first 30 minutes is the greatest battle scene ever created on film.I have to agree. The utter confusion and slaughter of war were so realistically portrayed that I was on the edge of my seat unaware of what horror was going to appear next. The movie as a whole created that feeling in me--the feeling of unease and tension of not knowing just what was going to happen next. The kind of feeling the soldiers must've felt at the time, although in much, much greater magnitude.Similarly, the last battle scene was harrowing and exciting. I thought it showed the utter confusion and violence of urban combat in graphic realism. The execution of some of the stunts and fight scenes were incredibly well-choreographed.All in all, SPR was the best war movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film (I won't be so brash as to call it a movie) confirms my belief that Steven Spielberg is one of, if not the most, talented people of the century. Yes, this sounds like butt-kissing, but it isn't. My grandfather died in WWII, as did millions of your grandfathers, fathers and brothers. Until I saw SPR, I, like many others, had tucked the mere thought of war into a drawer in my mind titled "ignore and it might go away". I am very much ashamed to admit I was one of those who complained that veterans should forget it and get on with their lives. Now though, I can honestly say that this film has changed my life. What's more, anybody who denies that it changed theirs is either lying or devoid of humanity.Obviously, as anybody who has seen the film will know, the first twenty minutes at Omaha beach are overwhelmingly shocking, heartbreaking and soul numbing. I sat in my seat, emotionally paralysed and totally disbelieving. I put my popcorn on the floor and couldn't bring myself to touch it again. I know people say the plot was often thin and the film slow moving but surely they realise this is far more true to life than non stop action? There were weeks on end where soldiers did nothing but wait in the trenches, where the build- up to the finale was far more nerve racking than the action itself because you knew something had to happen, you just didn't know when. The film reflects this. Therefore it is far MORE true to life than all the "War is Hell" films such as Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.To those who remain unconvinced, may I remind them a helpline was set up to comfort those who couldn't handle the journey back to the war. I work at a cinema, I have seen the effects of this film. I spent over an hour once, comforting a seventy-five year old man who came out of the film weeping like a child and couldn't bring himself to walk away from the building.War IS Hell. And to those who fought, and their equally brave families, we should offer nothing but our sincerest thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will attempt to differentiate my feelings about this film. Technically and theatrically, this film is a masterpiece. The visual effects and realistic atmosphere that are brought to the screen are breathtaking (in one way or another), and are unparallel by any other. Each performance made you feel like you were that character's friend or family member, and made you feel emotion for them. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a prime example of what movie making should be ... technically.Emotionally and personally, I have to admit that I can never watch this film again. The emotions of grief, fear, sadness, horror and despair that I felt from watching it made me literally sick. Although it was a masterpiece in the way the story was told, the story itself was disgusting. Being a Veteran of two MUCH less violent wars, I could only sit there and think of how I would have felt if I were there.I went to sleep that evening, after watching 'Ryan'; it was the most difficult night I have had in a while. I believe that this film should have carried an NC-17 rating, because if I was Spielberg, I'm not sure if I could live with a 16 year old kid (even WITH his parents) seeing the events that unfolded on that screen.All-in-all, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a theatrical masterpiece. But if you're going to watch it, be prepared for having your heart ripped out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corporal Upham was outstanding!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have talked about this movie in terms of the realistic violence and action throughout the movie. This certainly helps to drag people into the movie, but was not the most stunning thing I saw in this movie. Some people have highlighted the simple, but effective plot as a means to prove that it was not worthy of the title of best war movie of all time. My view was the movie was not really created to have detail plots to confuse people and make them think, rather the movie was about how pictures and images of war can say much much more than words can ever do. We not only get scenes of realistic action, but fundamentally the characterisation of Corporal Upham is one of the best achievements in ANY war movie. Whereas the other characters we have seen before in other similar war movies, Upham was so unique in war movies of any sort that he blew me away. Saving Private Ryan should have focused more upon Upham's character because it was far more interesting and realistic than all the other characters put together. This movie was a character study rather than plot tangles. Upham should not even be in the war, he is not only innocent, but is the moral person in the movie who affects the decisions and lives of the other soldiers around him. Throughout the movie we see his character slowly change and develop to the final scenes that is so full of emotionally realism that he beats other war movie characters. Scenes to watch out for are: 1) When he is left behind and watches his new friends take out a guarded post. 2) When he sits on the steps - absolutely incredible. 3) When he tries to save a German person's life. 4) And the final horrific emotionally scene of realism. And so many besides.The only off-putting thing about the movie is the propaganda concerning giving the impression that America is the best country in the world and saves us from losing the war, when in fact they were just additional help who did not join until Britain was in too much debt to the USA.</fullReview>

Five hours of boredom are suddenly followed by 5 minutes of unrelenting terror. That is precisely what this movie conveyed.Mr. Spielberg has done a masterful job putting you into this infantry unit. The combat scenes are grittily realistic, and not the least bit overly graphic. Got news for you folks, that's war.Everything is realistic and accurate, Dale Dye deserves a major bit of recognition for this. Tom Hanks and his bunch looked like an group who had seen their fair share of battle. Mr. Dye worked his magic to the same level on "Platoon".If you truly want to see an accurate depiction of what real war is like, this is the only film to see. Five stars out of five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Saving Private Ryan shortly after seeing The Thin Red Line and I can say that Mallick's film is definitely superior to Spielberg's. Yes the combat scenes in SPR were very powerful and realistic but I felt disappointed by the movie as a whole. The scenes where characters would just trade anecdotes of their lives in the States seemed tacked on and was a ham-fisted way of showing that the soldiers were just "regular boys who wanted to get home." And of course there was the final shot of the American flag fading to credits which clinched this film as being a fairly standard issue Hollywood war movie. The beach landing scene was gut wrenching but after the movie was over I really didn't think about it for too long, unlike The Thin Red Line which I think delves much further into the emotional aspects of what war is and leaves questions which need to be explored through multiple viewings of the film. Saving Private Ryan is a movie you should see, but once is enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard to compare war movie of different wars. All Quiet On The Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon are some of my favorites. Glory an Braveheart are also extremely good. Saying this is the best war movie ever is tough. Apocalypse Now, FMJ, and Platoon are all great movies but don't have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie. The cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique. It has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle. The story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius. It's a great Dr Strangelove feel of conflicting morals, interests, and sanity. Tom Hanks,Tom Sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and I'm not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone. Great writing and attention to detail including actual Panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie. The violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect. And the backdrop of D-Day (often called the greatest battle in history) provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is. Actual veterans went into siezers, flashbacks, and emotional trauma when viewing this movie. A help line was even set up to help them cope with the visions. That really says a lot about a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the Oscars, it honestly never occurred to me that SPR would not win best picture. I had seen all of the other movies, including Shakespeare In Love and Life is Beautiful, and while both were good movies, Shakespeare in Love being, in my opinion, the weakest of the big three, I could not comprehend how either one could honestly compete with SPR. Ryan was not a movie as much as it was an experience. The first scene, the landing on Omaha beach, evoked an emotional response I have never felt during a movie before. I felt as if I were there, as if bullets were wizzing past my head and bombs were ripping my closest friends to pieces around me. When the opening scene was over I almost felt as if I were going to throw up, and I was happy the experience was over. Saving Private Ryan was, by far the best movie of 1998 and the Academy showed, once again, that the quality of the movie counts much less than the ad campaign one puts on to win the big trophy. Not only did the Academy rob Spielberg and all who were involved in the making of the production, it robbed the veterans of the war. By giving the Oscar to a cute little film that, quite honestly, would have made good ol' William gag, the Academy turned their back on the veterans as a whole. Now, did anyone who suffered through the horrors of that war lose sleep because of the award ceremony; not likely. But the Academy ruined their chance to honor those who died giving us all the right to live free as we choose. It passed up its chace to say thank you to all that served by honoring the best movie ever made about the terrors our men endured over there. So, the only thing left to say is, shame on you Academy for rewarding a vigilant ad campaign as opposed to a master piece of modern times. Saving Private Ryan; Best Picture of 1998, trophy or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg does to Kurosawa and Welles what Mark McGwire did to Roger Marris in the magnificently staged battle scenes that bookend this D-Day melodrama. His beach-storming opening pushes the how-much-can-you-stand? envelope about twenty feet farther than even the most daring moments in SCHINDLER'S LIST; he seems to have an unerring sixth sense for the audience's breaking point. And the climax--a cat-and-mouse game between the spottily armed American platoon and a series of tank-bound Germans--suggests a set piece from THE GREAT ESCAPE with nineties technology and Spielbergian horse sense.It was Spielberg's derring-do that made this movie a monster hit--not the star presence of Tom Hanks as the saver and Matt Damon as the saved. And it certainly wasn't the script, which affords Spielberg a few opportunities for nicely offhand, verite-ish, lived-in scenes, but consists mostly of Tom Hanks staring at a distant cloud and delivering the most sentimental "unsentimental" bromides in a war movie ever. Hanks is supposed to be a scruffier, more cynical and wised-up version of the Henry Fonda Good American. His monologues of common, simple decency have the numbing monotony of a centrist Democrat Senator dedicating a new high school. Hanks morphing into a latter-day Jimmy Stewart is dismal enough; the speechifying by members of his platoon, especially the unendurable Ed Burns commemorating his girl-back-home's mammoth breasts, take the movie to flatline status. (The script was uncreditedly rewritten by Frank Darabont, of the poor-man's-Spielberg SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that 'Saving Private Ryan' is a war film would be like calling a Corvette a wagon. War films tend to glorify war, and show the other side as being Supermeanbadguys (new word!). But 'Saving Private Ryan' can be more accurately described as a war drama. In it, the war is anything but glorified. The scale of the war is shown on both a massive size (the Normandy invasion) and on a more personal level. The Germans seem bad, but they're just doing what we would do under the circumstances. However, even with this in mind, the audience can't help but hate them. This is the most dynamic part of the film; and is enough to make us forget the appallingly deflated character's in Speilberg's 'Schindler's List.' And, of course, there's the acting, with Hanks at his best, and the rest of the cast (Tom Sizemore and Jeremey Davies in particular) shines as well. Overall, a great film. And an utter travesty that it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the massively inferior 'Shakespeare in Love.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an exceptionally well done war movie. It is perhaps the greatest of all time, although in my mind it is waging its own war with Apocalypse Now for that prestigious title. It pulls no punches in its representation of the horrors of war. I am certain that most movie aficionados have heard the stories of veteran flashbacks and emotional breakdowns caused by the film. It is certainly the best portrayal of war in this decade. It has even bested Braveheart's violence, a feat thought impossible three years ago. The scene in which Private Mellish is killed by the German soldier chills me to this day. It is indeed a fantastic war movie. As a movie in general it is not quite as great. It still is a wonderful tale with moving emotional content but I feel certain it was not robbed at the Academy Awards. The characters seemed quite one-dimensional to me and the plot left something to be desired. In the end this film did not approach the quality of Tom Hanks' two Oscar winning performances. And to risk missing the forest for the trees, I must say that the opening scenes of the storming of the beaches at Normandy almost made me feel sick. This was not from the excessive gore, and that fact does trouble me somewhat, but instead from the camera work. I understand that in this age of "ER" popularity the "messy camera" look has become incredibly popular. In spite of this I think the excessive motion of the camera during this scene detracted from the film. I found it difficult to concentrate throughout. Personally I thought the camera work during the battles in Braveheart were much more effective in conveying the mood of a battlefield.</fullReview>

(Then of course there's the whole white-director-black-story issue, for which he's been paying ever since "The Color Purple".but don't get me started on that.) It may have been the best possible move for him to work with Tom "He Can Do No Wrong" Hanks this time out. This is definitely a five-hankie picture: I wept continuously for the first twenty minutes and was on the brink of tears for almost the entire remainder of its three-hours-plus running time. Spielberg has an uncanny ability to confront us on film with things that require our social and individual attention--consider "The Color Purple," "Empire of the Sun," "Schindler's List," "Amistad," and now "Saving Private Ryan." That these films were made by the same man who directed "Jaws," "E.T.," and the Indiana Jones movies is astonishing. No other filmmaker working today produces this variety of films, from those intended to prod and provoke thoughtful adults to those that speak so clearly to our children and to the child in each of us. "Saving Private Ryan" is a devastating depiction of and meditation on the costs of war, a heart-breaking but ultimately affirming examination of individual human worth. Tom Hanks is Everyman, with whom we can all identify, and Matt Damon is the titular Private Ryan, a beaming, scrub-faced, bright-eyed beautiful boy whom we all want to save. What is one man's life worth? What are the consequences of inhumanity? What is the value of integrity? This film shows us that society cannot answer these questions; the answers lie inside, and must come from within.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's forget for a second about camera angles and who used them before and what not. Let's give Spielberg his due without overdoing it. Let's talk about the movie. I challenge anyone to admit, honestly, that they were not shaken up and moved by the sequences in SPR. If you weren't you're either dead or Jeffrey Dahmer. Forget the cinematography and the battle scenes. The cast assembled did a brilliant job! Specifically Giovani Ribisi's performance. (which was underrated). And Ed Burns who I felt should of gotten a nod for a best supporting actor award. Hanks was solid and made his character work.Now to address my friends the brits, who are seemingly angry at the depiction of America's role in the war, and how SPR glorified Americans and Americans only. American movie, American director..do you see where this is going. Let someone else make a movie depicting the other perspectives. SPR told the story about American soldiers looking to locate a private and bring him home. It also did something else...It paid homage to the brave American soldiers that endured that nightmare that was D-day. Being a veteran myself who never saw combat, thank God, I collapsed in my chair and cried knowing people that lost their lives in the Gulf War. Let's not remember Private Ryan for who it didn't pay respect to, because I think that most of us are intelligent enough to know that there were other nations soldiers fighting and dying, but to whom it did pay homage to. The brave soldiers who fought in a strange place, and died to preserve the way of life that is right. War is hell and it is wrong. Life is too precious. I do agree that congress and the Pres. should view SPR prior to making any decision. But I also know that WW2 is history, and the men that died, from all nations, deserve my respect and my deepest thanks for preserving the lifestyle that is my own. There is a saying that says "you're a better man then me." I extend that to every soldier that fought, bled, and died on the allied side in WW2. And being a former sailor, I, like the elder Private Ryan, extend a hand salute to them.That's what Private Ryan did. It was the best war film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was truly a wonderful film from start to finish. I have never experienced war first hand, so I appreciated Spielberg's graphic depiction of the taking of Normandy Beach. The images of wave after wave of soldier being picked off by bullets or shrapnel truly gives meaning to the phrase "war is hell." Very few directors could do what Spielberg did for this first 20 minutes. Spielberg was able to build on this event and develop a story and a group of characters that the audience could truly identify with. Special kudos should go to Tom Hanks, whose presence on film easily matches that of Jimmy Stewart. In this movie Hanks embodies every American soldier who put his/her life on the line no matter the reason or the locale. A classic film that will be remembered for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is two films -- one terrific, the other just okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was two films, for me. The opening Omaha Beach landing sequence of 'Ryan' produced the most intense feeling I've ever experienced while watching a movie. Spielberg manages to trap history in a bottle and the sights and sounds -- especially the sounds -- are terrifying. Like the car chase in Steve McQueen's 'Bullit', Spielberg sets a marker that will hard to duplicate. After it was over I fully felt deserving of a campaign ribbon to wear on my polo shirt.Having thus been promised a peek into history, I was overly disappointed with Part II which degenerates into just a good action flic. Spielberg junks historical accuracy for post Vietnam sensibilities. Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his squad of Rangers are portrayed as post Vietnam philosophers who dwell on the unfairness of having to risk their lives for a political necessity -- saving the fictional Private Ryan. In point of fact, the loss of the five Sullivan brothers when their ship, the USS Juneau, was sunk in 1942 resulted in changed Navy policy about allowing brothers to serve on the same ship. The public wanted (but never got) a law to that effect. So, the idea of saving Private Ryan would not have struck these 1944 Rangers as particularly odd. The movie, though, portrays Gen. George C. Marshall as a callous political hack for recognizing this exigency. While the World War II grunt fought for the same reason all grunts fight -- honor (cowardice, at least in 1944, was still viewed as more distasteful than death), these guys need fulfillment.Other lapses continued to shake me out of my trance. A cameo appearance by Ted Danson, for instance, seemed out of place and I found myself thinking about Normy and Carla on Omaha Beach, and the pre-production Hollywood party when Spielberg says, "say Ted, if you're not doing anything tomorrow... ." Later, this squad of savvy Rangers is seen marching in file on the crest of a ridge, fully back-lit by the moon. Hardly something out of the Ranger survival guide. The action sequences, as always in a Spielberg production, were terrific, but by the end of Part 2 I was cynical about Spielberg's motives. Rated 8 out of 10 overall.</fullReview>

Never has grief, the enormity of this grief, been captured with so much power and been so evocative. There is the scene with the French child returning to her family who appear to be living "on a shelf," that is, what is left of the floor of their bombed-out building, and this precious little girl hitting at her father, after her father's attempts to give her to the soldiers to take to safety.

		<fullReview>The effect this movie has on you is devastating. The combat scenes in the movie are where you can find Speilberg exploring territory that no other director has before in war movies. Spielberg comes as close to capturing the madness of war by showing us the horror in an unrelenting fashion. Deaths alternate between quick and horrifying and slow and agonizing. It's unfortunate that such a pedestrian script was used to connect the awesome combat scenes. But the frustratingly simplistic plotline serves as a way for the characters to question war in a way a post-Vietnam American would, without making such questioning seem historically preposterous (as it did in "The Thin Red Line," whose "hero" has gone AWOL just months following Pearl Harbor). The movie would have been a 10 if not for the bookends (Private Ryan visiting Normandy as an old man) that were taken from "Titanic."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the idiocy of the Academy, easily the best movie of 1998.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tragic that the Academy did not vote Ryan the best movie of 1998. Those movies that deservedly get "Best Movie" Oscars are known for their "shelf life," that characteristic that makes such movies classics, rentable, watchable, buyable 25, 50, 75 years from now. Saving Private Ryan has that quality...in spades. Shakespeare in Love? Hardly. Spielberg has given us something special. Like Schindler, Ryan hits us in the gut, not without cause or good reason, but in the gut just the same. "So THAT'S what grandpa went through." People file out from the movie, somber, disturbed, but grateful that there ever was such a generation, such a bunch of men that went through hell so we could be free forever more.Of course, it won every award for sound. How could it not? It's as if you were parachuted down to Omaha Beach yourself on that grey-blue June morning. I watched other movie goers. People blanched. Wept. Gripped their seats. Ducked. Cursed the coward. And this movie's not the best of the year? Come on! Such fluff as Shakespeare is fun to watch, but like Wonder Bread, the vitamins, the nutrients, the "guts" have been sucked out. After watching the Bard, an hour later you want more. You know that such fluff doesn't last. Sorry, Steven. Keep writing and finding great stories for us. If we don't appreciate what you've done now, we will. When we're old and decrepid, we'll make our way down to the futurama video rental--only to see that Ryan is once again sold out! But Shakespeare in Love? Why, there're plenty of copies. Imagine that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in one of the best war films ever made. Tom Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are dead and the mother was going to receive all three letters at once. The opening scene of the old man walking in the war veteran's cemetary with his family a few steps back. Unless people have seen the film before, we don't know who this man is or what significance it has on the film; It gets tied in at the end of the film. I saw Saving Private Ryan twice and the opening scene had such a powerful impact on th rest of the film, but it was one of those things that you must watch it more than once to fully understand it as I did. Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. I love the loyalty that Tom Sizemore's character, Sgt. Horwath, holds for his boss Capt. Miller. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me. The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute war scene at the beginning was eye-opening to say the least. At first, I hated that part since it was so long and drawn out; but, when I saw it the second time just a few days ago I understood why it was done this way. I think Spielberg wanted to bring out emotions and make a statement to the audience that war is something that was devastating and something that should never have happened. Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. Matt Damon continues to produce box office hits as does Tom Hanks and the incomprible legend Steven Spielberg. Saving Private Ryan is one film to savour over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most stunning war film in cinematic history. Steven Spielberg has crafted an unbelievable recreation of the Normandy Invasion and story that follows. By using bleached out lighting and a guerrilla style of camerawork, Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the battle. Januscz Kaminski's camera seems to be everywhere at once without losing the viewer. At the center is the performance by its cast. They perform with a quiet sense of dignity not seen in films today. Tom Hanks gives his most memorable performance to date as Capt. John Miller, a battle-weary citizen-soldier who has seen too much. Hanks is without a handicap in this role, unlike Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. The character he creates is one who is faced with an insurmountable task and in carrying it out, must keep himself and his men alive, and without losing his own sanity and decency. This performance easily surpassed Oscar winner Roberto Benigni's. Alongside Hanks' performance is beautiful portrayals by Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, and Matt Damon. This was by far the best film of the year, easily beating Shakespeare in Love. It is sad to see that an ad campaign can buy a film an Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most all that can be said about this film has been said. I won't argue with "Saving Private Ryan" naysayers, because in a sense I see some of the points they try to make. Personally, it is one of the most powerful experiences I've had at a motion picture.I think it's important to point out that, though we've seen some scenes from the middle done before in other war movies, that doesn't make them in any way conventional or hackneyed. The film's much-heralded opening scene of the landing at Normandy provides color and mood for all scenes that follow. One very nearly may not have enough emotional resources left to endure the final battle scene, but Spielberg is not beating us over the head.In 1987, my mother made me sit through the harrowing TV holocaust drama "Escape From Sobibor", for which I was resentful then but grateful now. In the early days of film, audiences literally ducked out of the way, reacting to a shot of a speeding locomotive. I mention these two things because I want to communicate why we go to movies to begin with. One reason is to witness the horrific events of our past, in hopes that we can prevent them from happening again. The other--and this can only be done if the movie makers are skilled enough (and Spielberg clearly is) is to convince us of the authenticity of a time and place.We go to the trouble of going to the movie theatre for a reason. We hope we are going to be glad we went. When the lights go down, our muscles tighten in anticipation. I was happy to have seen "Saving Private Ryan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as the movies "2001" and "Star Wars" changed forever the expectations of movie goers for that genre, "Ryan" has changed what audiences expect from a combat movie. Even though the characters in the movie are made up, the units, equipment, and events are real. I had already read several of Stephen Ambrose's books about the European Theater of Operations (D-Day, Citizen Soldiers) before I saw the film. So when I heard about the "realistic" combat scenes, I had to see it. Spielberg said in an interview that there was a line he did not cross with the blood and gore. As gory as the movie was, I believe that he was correct. He could have made it much worse without departing from reality. The most important impact the movie may have is that it makes history interesting in the way Schindler's List did. I would love to see Spielberg take on other historic stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The initial 30 minutes are groundbreakingly realistic, and probably give a truer sense of what it was like to storm the Normandy beaches than any film that has come before.Unfortunately, the middle half of the film wanders about aimlessly, as the characters - a checklist of war-types - gather themselves for the finale, which sets the soldiers on a well-worn path. Also, the attitudes of the soldiers reflects the cynical, resentful 1960s generation of war protesters and draft dodgers, not the genuinely heroic generation that actually fought WWII. As a result, I think this film (like almost everything else) pales next to the more authentic THE LONGEST DAY; another good one is THE BIG RED ONE which features a checklist of movie-army-types led into battle by Lee Marvin, and is similar in structure to RYAN but more authentic as well.That said, the opening scenes and the finale feature some of the best war scenes ever filmed. The movie works on another level as well: we're the ones who were saved by that generation's ultimate sacrifice, and like Ryan we should be asking ourselves, "What have I done to deserve the sacrifices made for _me_?"</fullReview>

The acting is hardly good, not because of the actors, who did what they could, but because of the story, which made the acting secondary.

		<fullReview>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a triumphant masterpiece about heroism, integrity, and humanity.Imagine...a soldier, fighting in the middle of a horrific war. The date is June 6, 1944, otherwise known as 'D-Day.' On the shores of Normandy, the D-Day Invasion happens. The good guys, the U.S. Army fights valiantly against all the obstacles that fate has decided to utilize. Suddenly, pulled into the heart of the battle, machine guns start firing in all directions. Explosions could be reverberated from miles away. The soldier hesitates, waiting for that clear shot. Everywhere he goes, he watches in anguish as one by one, his allies fall. Bodies of defeated souls rest all over the place, on the grass, the sand, and even floating dead around the sea. The water is adulterated with human blood, the screams of the mortally wounded echo in a whirlpool of agony. Medical experts rush to save the injured, many are not lucky. As a soldier, he is about to breakdown. Then, the glimmer at the end of the tunnel is an insinuation for him to keep fighting...The above paragraph is an example of how technically proficient the introductory battle sequence has been directed by Steven Spielberg in this trenchant motion picture. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the story of Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other marines who go on a quest to save the life of one damned soul...Private Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three older brothers have all been killed in action. Miller's second-in-command, Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), along with the sniper expert, Private Reien (Edward Burns), are obligated to save this very one life. Unlike many others who have sacrificed themselves in pain and suffering, this particular Private Ryan can not bare to lose his very own life...for he is the last surviving member of his family so that can perpetuate the bloodline...The 40 minute prelude in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is one of the most disturbing yet cogent images ever filmed on camera. At the beginning, with see Captain Miller's perspective of World War II's toll both in human costs and emotional value. Little subtleties have damaged Miller for life, i.e. he constantly shakes his right hand whenever he tries to drink from a water bottle. Miller, a mere English schoolteacher only wants a ride home...but this time...him along with seven of his trusted allies must be coerced to get the mission done...As for the cast, Tom Sizemore is equally stunning and mesmerizing as his cohort who tries to keep a straight composure, but he loses his temper as well. Edward Burns doesn't have a big role, but he contributes heavily as another of the persevering Privates, proficient with his aim. Matt Damon is also terrific as Private Ryan, one soldier who puts his duty before his own life.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an excruciating experience that boldly pulls the viewer into the heart of the World War II so realistically unlike most other films. The introduction showing everybody the devastating costs of inhumane violence is already a gory eye-catcher that may turn off much of the squeamish. Still, don't let the strong violence deter you from watching this movie, this film is a must-see.Instead of glamorizing on violence as usually stereotypically depicted in other movies, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN plunges the viewer into the real consequences of war. As the stark but unforgettable saying goes, "War is hell."SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, though fictional, has been based on the inspirational real-life story of "The Fighting Sullivans," five brothers who all served in the same naval services... Unfortunately for them...one torpedo has claimed all five of their lives and has permanently scarred a family for life...Few motion pictures in cinematic history have touched so many people's lives, hearts, and souls as this epic motion picture. Often living in a society where we take freedom for granted, these steadfast soldiers portrayed in this indelible film have dedicated their lives to save us...and the world from absolute oppression, persecution, and tyranny.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is one splendid picture, capturing every turbulent moment of the lives of these selected eight men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the archetype of the consummate war film. The intro and climactic sequences for this film are eye-catching, and the characterizations for this movie have never been in so much depth. The climax in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN where both sides take their tolls is an exemplary concept of how talented a director Steven Spielberg truly is. The severity of war in this film and every life involved in it has been captured so well in detail.If there is only one complaint I must give about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, it's that this movie is a little bit too sluggish at times. It can be cut down to around 2 hours and still be a great film. Otherwise, this is a flawless masterpiece. Superb, solemn, and sharply powerful. The lesson that has been so successfully achieved in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is that confrontation on the true aspects of the horror of war can bring out only the best and heroic attitudes of anybody who has the courage. It is also amazing that in this film, despite all the disheveled scenes the characters must face, they still manage to retain a good sense of humor once in a while. This movie deserves all exalted praises! Too bad the Academy Awards did not allow SAVING PRIVATE RYAN to win the Oscar for Best Picture...RATING: **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I laid my eyes on this film (I have seen it about 10 times now), I was filled with awe and inspiration. The "transitional" wide-angle shot of the grunts being torn to peices just as the higgins boats reach the beach are the most horrifying (and at the same time) the most beautiful images I have ever seen on film. The half-hour that follows (and I don't think that many will disagree with me) is flawless filmmaking. Unfortunately, that is the problem. The first half-hour is SO damned strong in fact, that it is in MY opinion that the momentum of the rest of the film suffers in comparison. Like "Braveheart" and "All Quiet on the Western Front", Speilberg showed his ideas through emotions and feelings rather than words. I believe that was all accomplished in the first act of the film, leaving the rest of the picture to fend for itself. What turned out to be a very intelligent move by Robert Rodat and Speilberg was to use each member of the squad to express an intruiging symbolic idea. To me, that made upfor the lack of any solidity to the story-line that may have existed. The level of violence and arbitrariness are without a doubt maxed out here, but at good cause. ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about what unfolded on Omaha Beach that morning knows that it was a collosal bloodbath full of blood, guts, vomit, and death. If you would read Steven Ambroses' "D-Day" novel, you would actually realize that "Saving Private Ryan" was just an edited version of what occurred that morning on the different sectors of Omaha Beach. Never-the-less, this film is a true repreasentation of raw power and gritty realism, that I am sure, will not be passed up for a long while in scope.</fullReview>

It allows you to travel back time, and allows you to feel the terror of the world's greatest destroyer. Steven Spielberg has presented this movie brilliantly, and captured most of its audiences.

I did not have trouble sleeping the next day, but that morning after, my mind finally grasped the magnitude of the losses felt by the American family. Steven Spielberg socked it to us, so to speak, with his brilliant opening onthe bloodied, gory beaches of Normandy, 1944. Using hand held cameras, 8mm footage, and the inclusion of mistakes , like the camera being dropped, showed us the confusion, the fear, the unpreparedness of that French beach. one cannot blink, for he or she is so involved in the film. That is what a movie should do to a person. To anyone who didn't like this movie, I suggest you jump into the theatre again and watch it, then look at your soul, for it was the young men who fought that and those wars to give that soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, a WWII vet (but not European Theater) this was one of the three most powerful wartime movies I have ever seen. "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", and "Saving Private Ryan". But Ryan benefits from the improved technology in film making, which makes it more powerful, visually, than the other two. And the director's ability to make great films with epic sweep is another advantage of Ryan. I believe that every American from the age of 15 on should see this film, to understand what it means to go to war, or to send men and women into war. The realism of Ryan was overwhelming. My wife and I could not leave our seats after the film for almost 15 minutes. We were overwhelmed emotionally. A unique experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was 100% worthy of the best picture Oscar. I can tell you that no other filmmaker could direct a more realistic depiction of warfare on Omaha beach during WWII. It was so vivid that you were almost there, witnessing (but not experiencing) the brutality, pain, and fear the soldiers went through. The first 20 minutes or so of this film is increasingly graphic, but if you've ever wondered the true nature of a story told by a surviving veteran relative, here it is!The plot is part non-fiction and part fiction, focusing on a mother who wants her son brought home after his three remaining brothers are killed in battle. A platoon of men (head by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Garry Pepper) are sent to find the last remaining Ryan, Pvt. James Ryan (played by Matt Damon, who does not overact in the role) behind enemy lines. Each and every soldier was different, and what made it so interesting was how they interacted with one another. Yes, they were extremely sympathetic. The cinematography was brilliant, as was the set (which they actually filmed in international areas.) Another memorable scene was their conversations in that broken down French town towards the finale (Cherbourg?) speaking of romances that occurred back home and the irony of that record player working, with a French lady singing about heartbreak. A very UN-Hollywoodish movie.I could recommend this film to anyone, and if you can't stand to stay to see the beginning, come in when that part is over. Anyone who says this movie was "boring" and "pointless" most likely has not seen the movie, or they are just fans of the Adam Sandler/Pauly Shore genre. Ignore the negative reviews you read about this film and just see it. It will go right through you, and you will be shocked, moved, and in awe as a result."Saving Private Ryan" ranks in the TOP 20 as being one of the BEST War movies of all time and in the TOP 10 as the BEST films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is in itself a simple story and the mission of saving private Ryan not a major event in this terrible war. Yet it points out that it was still about human values and our fight to preserve them. The terror facing those brave soldiers and the agony that they lived in, could not have been visualized better than in this Spielberg's masterpiece. These eye to eye, life to death moments of this film are icy cold realistic and closer to experiencing the WWII we can hardly get. It is an long awaited ovation to the bravehearts and the victims of this war. The lessons from WWII should never be forgotten. As in Schindler's list, Spielberg and associates have again given us the vital lesson of realizing how precious piece and life are. This powerful film is one of the greatest ever - my score is 10.</fullReview>

As a student of conflict in general and World War II in particular, I find it to be a masterpiece, a tribute to those men who, when history called, put down their tools, calmly went off defeat the forces of evil, then modestly returned to everyday life without another word.Their generation was the bravest there was. I wonder if the "me-me-me" generations which followed have earned the sacrifices they made at Normandy, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Tarawa, and Anzio.The Academy would be doing a great disservice if Saving Private Ryan is not selected as best picture for 1998.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>connect the dots war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spectacular action scenes do not make a classic war movie. This film has two of them, that serve as bookends for a rather dull middle.The war scenes are extremely well done, that much is true. But many people, who hail this film as a classic, seem to substitute well filmed action &amp; carnage for that of a "classic". How many films that came before this one have told us of the horrors of war, that war is hell, &amp; "this is how it really was"? Even if the war scenes in SPR are superior to that of ,say, the Deer Hunter or Platoon, does it make it a better film? No. SPR has nothing new to say about war. It may contain more extravagant war scenes than these other war films, but don't go mistaking it for a classic, or the "ultimate war film".Something has always bothered me about Spielberg's films. He is incapable of subtlety or nuance . Everything is out in the open, spelled out, leaving nothing to the imagination, or to the mysteries &amp; complexities of human nature.He has always struck me as a kid, showing off his film making skills, trying to outdo everyone else's films on whichever genre. .He takes heavy weight subjects such as the holocaust, war, slavery, &amp; cheapens them. And because of the sensitivity of these topics, we are not allowed to criticize him or his films, because his intentions are worthy or noble. It's not the subject matter of his films I have a problem with, it's his treatment of them that I dislike.Compared to the Thin Red Line, SPR has a connect the dots mentality.It has none of the compassion, complexity or rich layering that the TRL has. But because it does have the enormous amount of carnage &amp; gore that the TRL doesn't have, it gets more attention.Even in a war film such as the TRL, there is still room for subtlety. Spielberg is only trying to outdo the war films that have come before his. He'll push all the buttons necessary &amp; use all the tricks he knows to do this.SPR is firstly an action film, and that's why most people like it. The bits about the loss of human life, the sacrifices these men made,etc. are secondary, and only serve to prop the film up and attempt to give it loftier &amp; more meaningful ideals than it actually has. Let's face it, SPR enthusiasts are going to see this film for the very thing that the film (unsuccessfully) tries to denounce: the horror &amp; violence of war. Don't be fooled.</fullReview>

It was obvious, that this was the closest anyone there had ever gotten to actual combat - that we had been transported back in time to a hell on earth and that nobody was ever going to be able to look at any war movies in the same light again.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan. The title alone is brilliantly written, obviously by Robert Rodat, but the title doesn't really even begin to match the movie's over all breadth and scope. Yes a hodgepodge of war-versed soldiers enter into heavily German infested French countryside and find many little happenstance adventures along the way to Ryan, but that is not what this film 'wants' to be about. The long extended scenes of pure adrenaline horror, was an exercise in realism by Spielberg, never sophomoric, but absolutely true in its depiction of terror while in combat. In past attempts at 'experiencing' film terror, or as Alex from Clockwork Orange would say, "Vidying terror", I viewed some 8 or 9 snuff films known as the 'faces of death', and my memories of those grisly scenes coincided at times in SPR. One scene in particular, when Tom and his men are clinging for dear life on bullet ridden sand dunes, and the camera frenetically shifts back and forth between screaming characters, then captures Tom pulling over a man with his face caved in. I swore at that moment that I had seen something similar in faces of death. Scenes like this, or Cpt. Miller kneeling on the beach with stream of blood trickling down his face as soldiers engulfed in flames try to carry on fighting, or Medic Wade vaingloriously claiming to have 'stopped the bleeding' as a bullet rips thru the soldier's helmet, remind me of the gritty atrociousness not only in movies, but in life. Yes, real life. The opening of Ryan, not the Normandy beach opening, but the Normandy cemetery is very poignant. Line after line of white marble headstones, extending into the vanishing point, and the bereaved veteran humbled into silent weeping in their presence. Then, another genius stroke of Spielberg, the camera dollies slowly into the veteran's deep transcendant eyes, and then the crash of waves into the rusted hedgehogs; saltwater ebbing and flowing cautiously thru its iron legs. Although, as I watched SPR, the critic in me couldn't completely be astonished by the 'warrior poetry'. I saw Spielberg draw influences from such directors as Kubrick, De Palma, Kurosawa, and even Tarantino. One scene, I think borrows heavily from True Romance, a movie written by the feverishly popculture zeitgeist genius of Quentin Tarantino, in which the soldiers are locked in a Mexican standoff with equally surprised Nazis, chaotically yelling profanities at each other. Peckinpah I think would be especially proud with the usage of chameleon-like and unexpected violence and gore. There's one scene in The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah's answer to the 7 samurai, in which a bank robber's horse wobbles and then crashes through a plate glass shop window, whilst the camera frenetically weaves between slow and fast motion. In the final battle in SPR, this Wild Bunch scene re-emerged in my mind when a bomb blasted soldier hurdles thru a shop window ala Peckinpah. There is so much to write about this movie that it would take several days and nights to fully begin to encompass its creative inputs. I'll leave with one final comment; I think the final battle was a homage to Stalingrad, one of the last and greatest sieges in military history, where Nazi and Russian soldiers battled it out tooth and nail in the bomb hollowed city and in such odd places like wine cellers, church bell towers and antique shops. Saving Private Ryan definately does it justice.</fullReview>

All the jostling of the camera gave me a headache and my mom felt like she was going to throw up. I tried to explain to her that was intended to portray the chaos of war. However, I don't know how realistic the movie is since I wasn't there at Omaha Beach and I'm not a military buff. Being a member of generation x, I'm pretty far removed. Through the opening scene, I just thought it was great special effects. But, if this is even close to what our veterans had to go through, then I'm shocked at the horrors and grateful for their sacrifices.SPR was intended to show the brutal ugliness of war. It wasn't meant to entertain. The storyline itself was stupid. I don't think eight men would be sent to find one. On the whole, I was very bored by the three hours and normally I would give a movie such as this 3/10 stars because war just isn't my favorite genre. However, due to the important message it carries, especially to young people, I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

This film realism is so real it is hard to believe that this production was,in fact, after all, a drama and not a documentary. My mind is now permanently blown. Steven Spielberg is the ultimate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else can I say other than how excellent this movie was?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really, really, thought this was a great movie. Other people do too, but I don't think the ones I know like this movie the right way. My psychiatrist didn't think it held up too well, and my sick friends thought the gut-wretching violence was funny. I am very offended by their views and anybody else's views if they disagree with me. I want to see this movie in theater before I miss my chance. I will never watch this on video. You couldn't pay me. Back to the movie, Steven Spielberg is one of the world's greatest directors. Tom Hanks is also one of the best actors. All the actors were excellent in their roles. I also liked Jeremy Davies. He was a really good character. I think he should have gotten nominated for an Acadamy Award. The direction, every conceivable detail, the wonderful cinematography, the editing, the fact that humor could be fit in to a movie like this, the battle sequences from Omaha Beach to the final one in the destroyed German town, this is just some of the things I can mention. I don't have anything bad to say about this movie. I only have good things to say.</fullReview>

Just because there's a fight in the beginning and a fight in the end, and a quiet but extremely skillful character doesn't make it a Kurosawa rip-off.

		<shortDescription>Visually and Emotionally Stunning Film but Without Heart and Soul.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat in a theatre, surrounded by strangers and by the end of this film, I felt I was pulled into the battlefields of WWII. Spielberg's main goal with this film was to create the reality of war, the horror, the fear, the gore, the devastation. He succeeded on all counts. The action sequences were nothing short of incredible, very realistic and frightening. But unfortunately, I think that Speilberg's desire to create the most visually powerful war film of all time was overpowering his ability to tell a good story.The story was not a very good one. The story is the heart and soul of a film and it cannot be compromised for the sake of expressing the strictly visual component of that story. Not only was it completely unbelievable that the US army would send out a group of soldiers in search of one man in the middle of war but the whole movie you are just waiting for another battle to take place. It kind of reminded me a bit of the movie, "Twister." Of course, it was much better than "Twister" as a whole but it had a similar structure, good action interrupted by a bad story. All of the performances are fantastic (and that makes the story watchable, unlike "Twister") and some of the Rodat's writing is good (Like Matt Damon's "back home" speech) but the film's visual presentation of war is just so enthralling that no story could probably match it. It is the downfall of any movie which has a much more talented director than screenwriter.That doesn't mean to say that that combination of writer/director can't work. I believe that Face/Off had a pretty unbelieveable story but John Woo's ability to intergrate the visuals of the film into the story itself and tell the crazy story so matter-a-factly makes it work. Spielberg didn't seem to take as much interest in the progression of the narrative as he did into the progression of the battle scene. And ultimately, this makes the film stagnate quite frequently.I still believe the film to be worthy of Best Picture, Cinematography, Editing and a number of technical awards. I don't think that it deserves to win Best Director or Screenplay (but it mostly still will win). The chemistry that is essential to making a story work was not there and that holds the film back from being a complete masterpiece. If you want to watch WWII film which incorporates both good writing and good direction watch Terrence Malik's "The Thin Red Line" (it at least has a better balance of the two). Still watch "Saving Private Ryan", just don't expect to start crying for the characters and their conflict, but expect to cringe in your seats at the horrors of war which Speilberg brings to the screen with incredible authenticity and realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive, aren't we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan does a couple of things that make it a worthwhile film. 1)It depicts combat as hell. It gives a realism to film combat that lets those of us lucky enough not to have been there realise just how lucky we are. 2)It lets us pay tribute to those old men we see on Veterans Day and ANZAC day (in Australia &amp; New Zealand). We now can appreciate why they still march. As for the sensitivity of some of American friends to comments regarding American patriotism... Of course there is no reason to criticize the depiction of Americans in an American war film. However, maybe, just maybe, the film would be stronger if nationality was taken out of the equation and we saw it for what war is...People killing each other while in fear of their own lives because of politics. We can be proud of what these people did for our freedom but they didn't do it for a coloured piece of cloth, they did it because they were asked to defend freedom and once in battle, they did it to survive. So, American friends, don't be so sensitive. Your people have done alot for the rest we know but we're allowed to criticise a film maker who likes to wave flags in his war movie...that's what starts them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The similarity between SPR and Seven Samurai is amazing:1. the story structure:the leader (Hanks and Takeshi) both fought in the beginning, then searched for team members, a long march to destiny,waiting for fight in the ruins or the vilage, the final long fight. 2. the team members are even more similar: a sophiscated leader a silent cool shooter or a silent sharp swordman the youngest member can't fight but he changed in the end. The theme is highly borrowed from Lean's "the bridge over river kwai".All those above explained why there was such an unrealistic objective (saving private ryan) and they had to stay to fight.The movie is not original in many senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My humble skills as a writer lend me no assistance in capturing the trauma that one experiences while watching this movie. The best way for me to sum it up is by telling you what typical audience reaction greets the end credits - stunned silence.It is a testament to the power of this piece of film that it leaves viewers in shocked awe of the ordeal that the WWII generation must have faced at home and in combat. The documentary-style cinematography and gritty violence draws the audience into the terror that faced every person that came ashore in Normandy that cold June morning.As incredibly nerve-wracking as that sequence is in the film, there is a hard truth that every viewer keeps in his mind. It is this fact alone that allows us to watch in fascination as scores of men are slaughtered on the beach.The undeniable truth is that this is make-believe.The bullets are not real. The blood is fake. When the director called "Cut!" everyone in the scene got up and went to the buffet. So as bad as it looks on camera, we realize that it's all just a lot of masterful storytelling.The film's triumph lies in the slowly dawning idea that grows within the audience. By the end, there is a small voice that whispers, "This is a movie, but for many it was real - and even worse than what was shown..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing battle scenes, subpar story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monumental film never to be forgotten...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's 2nd masterpiece of war is a shocking and relentless epic that is a perfect blend of emotion and current film technology. There has never been a battle scene as brutally realized as the storming of Omaha Beach, and no other filmmaker has come anywhere remotely close to capturing the horrors of war. You find yourself forgetting where you are and who is even in this 'movie'. I say this meaning the film seems like a documentary, as well as a first hand account, exemplified in the compelling scenes where Hanks' Captain Miller sees everything in slow motion, blood splattering on him and all. The carnage is as close to war as anyone who has never been to war can get. Forget APOCALYPSE, forget THIN RED LINE, forget even PLATOON. This is it.Actors who have participated in the film say they cannot believe what is on the screen. Matt Damon is quoted as saying he forgot he was in the film while watching the final sequence. People will ask them forever what it was like to be in this picture. Veterans have sent their thanks to Spielberg and his crew for honoring them with this absolute classic. It will be studied forever in schools, grammar on up. It deserves every award it will receive and we all a owe debt to those who made such an important and awesome film that shows us the depths of the human condition, human collaboration, and human hell. Best Picture of the year, if not the decade. It will be universally immortalized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six men for the price of one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPR is without a doubt one of the most talked about films of the year. I recently went to see it in the theatre to figure out why. It's impossible to judge this movie on a grand scale, since there are so many little intricacies.Storyline: Less than fresh. Three brothers die, so a team of men is sent to find the remaining brother to take him home. Uh-huh, yeah, that's realistic. This movie basically has no storyline. It's just a bunch of dialogue strung together in the hopes that someone will make sense out of it all.Casting: While each one of the actors cast in the role did an admirable job (with particular notice going to Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, who were both extremely impressive), I'd be interested in knowing why Spielberg thought he couldn't go within ten miles of reality. I'm sorry, but the average age of a soldier during WWII was not 35. It was 20. It's a sad, sad day when a 22-yr-old Giovanni Ribisi is the closest thing Spielberg has to a realistic soldier.Emotional Reality: In as far as getting the reactions of soldiers, Spielberg did a fairly good job. Yes, war is Hell, which is what Spielberg showed with his message that war could turn any man into a monster. Too bad he killed it with chain of command. Those officers were just a tad too willing to scream at their CO's.Physical Reality: There are a lot of complaints about the Americanism of the film. Of COURSE the film is Americanised! The only unit that actually managed to land anywhere near Omaha Beach was American. While it is asking a little much to expect viewers to believe that the troops never ran into troops from any other army, I don't think Spielberg wanted to test his luck. He couldn't get his OWN country's uniforms A-OK, let alone another country's.Truthfulness: We ALL know that there is absolutely no fact in this movie whatsoever. Spielberg may have originally touted this as "the true story of the Niland brothers", but he recanted long ago, since it's obvious it wasn't. (If it was, they'd have gotten at least one fact in that story right.)Military Reality: I'm with the experts on this one. A little less flash and trash there, Spielberg, and make an effort next time to get the right kind of weaponry. And BTW, Spielberg, no army would risk losing eight men to get one home, even if he was the president's son.Cinematic Worth: Excellent. While the direction at times was a little choppy and left something to be desired, this was still an excellent movie.Most people who are dissatisfied with this movie are probably those who expected to see a true story. Sorry, but you got the wrong war movie of 1998 -- the true story is in "The Thin Red Line", which in itself is an excellent war movie. Now sure, I admit, I spent half the movie hoping Matt Damon's character would get it in the end, but I was still extremely satisfied. (I did have to practically hold my great-uncles, both of whom were at Normandy, down to get them to stay -- both wanted to leave in disgust with Spielberg's Hollywoodization and capitalization on this horrific event.) It was well worth going to see in the theatre, and I don't often do that. I do think, though, that the movie will be highly disappointing once on video, because it's the kind of movie one NEEDS to see in a theatre.Altogether? It's not the best movie of the year, but it's not the worst. It's an excellent fictional account of what life COULD have been like in WWII for a group of soldiers. If you want reality, watch "The Thin Red Line", but if you enjoy fictionalized war films like SPR, check out any of the films available in the "War" section of your local video store. Well, okay, so maybe "Rambo" isn't the thing to go for, but there are a number of excellent movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is stupid. Observe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Spielberg makes a serious film he makes a SERIOUS film. After Schindlers List all I could think was: "That wasn't Spielberg. It can't have been. Where was the crowd pleaser set pieces? Where was the whimsical family aspect?" I really didn't think Spielberg was capable of the viciousness he displayed when that film was made. Until I saw this one. 'Vicious' doesn't even begin to describe him.I came into this film knowing all the hype. How it was such a harrowing account. How it never flinched. How it didn't look away from the gory details. But no matter how much you know coming in you're never prepared enough. Within the first ten minutes you're dropped into this picture of Hell on Earth.As the boats charge relentlessly towards Omaha beach you can see it coming. As the soldiers on board throw up from seasickness and fear the conclusion is inevitable. The twenty second call is heard. The palms sweat from your feeling of helplessness. The locks on the landing craft doors spin open. The faces of the soldiers behind it eat into your heart. And then it happens. They're dead. They didn't know what hit them. All hell breaks loose. Men drop left, right and centre. Machine-gun fire rains down on them like hailstones. Except these troops aren't punched by neat, circular holes. Oh no. They're torn apart. Shredded. Minced. Arms are removed. Heads caved in. Troops turn to see the person they were dragging to safety has turned into a piece of meat. The ensuing 25 minutes feel like an eternity. Please God let this end. When the beach assault was finally over my mother, who I saw the film with, turned to me and said "They didn't stand a chance did they?" I didn't reply.The motive of this film was to take the heroic notions of War films and crush them totally. War just doesn't work. It's a stupid way to solve an argument. The message is agonisingly unavoidable. It's hard to argue a case for conflict after you've seen too many people die. Anyone that says that prolonged contact with scenes of violence de-sensitizes you clearly hasn't watched this. In a similar vein to All Quiet On The Western Front, this film should be shown to future generations until the word 'War' is removed from the dictionaries. At least the first 30 minutes should be.After the brutality of Omaha the film calms down to become a more philosophical study into the futility of war. This is where things start to derail. Apart from Hanks' Miller, whose third Oscar was no doubt being moulded while this was made, none of the other leads get a look in. Miller's unit is made up of a pretty stereotypical bunch (whining jew, sympathetic medic, cowardly translator) and attempts to give them an extra dimension don't really work. Sizemore comes close with the job of dependable Sergeant but he just isn't given enough to do. The Germans are also given something of a rough ride. Whilst they are shown as being more human this time there's still an unshakable 'Evil Master Race' feel to the whole affair. There's also the problem of the final battle sequence. Where Omaha gave us the war=meatgrinder equation, the bridge defense opts for the more normal "A few good men can make a difference" approach. Add the lack of any allied units (We're in France. Where are the French Resistance?) and you have a rather mixed final message.This isn't the greatest War film ever (Full Metal Jacket wins easily) but it's an unflinchingly moving movie which will often chill and occasionally scar. It sometimes feels like a grown up Indiana Jones but Omaha Beach has to be seen to be believed. You may not be the same person after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that "Saving Private Ryan" is a good movie. Mostly because, to me, it was able to show the horrors of war in a quite realistic way. And how there are no heroes, in fact, for an American movie, its strength was that it showed the grays, not the black and whites. And the first twenty minutes I sat watching as the lump in my throat grew.But why the present-past-structure? I think the message would have been brought across to me just as powerfully if it had been done in the past only. Without the manipulation of perspective, without the dreadfully over-the-top sentimental scene at the end at the cemetary. Without those frightfully unbelievable last words (wouldn't he have thought about his wife, maybe linked to that memory in the garden?). I could've done without it. And also without those glorious American flags that started and ended the movie.Why claim this war? What I liked about it was that it was quite vague about all the different nationalities, making it more of a general protest against war. The American flags weaken that aspect. Other than that, it could've been a perfect and very powerful movie. That makes me, a post-war child, respect all people who've experienced and survived war even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a motion picture that made such an impact on my senses, emotions, and my respect of all the other people who have served during a war. SPR was incredible in its scope of cinematography, sound, technical accuracy, and how each of the actors portrayed their characters. Sure, there will be some viewers who will not like SPR for their own reasons, but I believe most people will be glad they went to see it. It's a fictional story about a few U.S. Army soldiers during the Normandy invasion and the mission they are given. In my opinion, this movie should get an Oscar for best picture and possibly Tom Hanks for best actor. I was impressed with his portrayal of Capt. Miller. He was very believable. I say this because I have served with men like this. But I am thankful I never had to go through what those men went though on the day or at any other time. I would like to thank all those who helped keep this country great in its history. I am proud beyond measure to be an American.

		<fullReview>This movie made me realize how horrible war is, and why it is important that we are never involved in another one. As always Spielberg has presented us with such an exciting and involving picture that the experience will not soon be forgotten. There are some stand-out performances in this movie. Tom Hanks puts on an exceptional performance as "Capt. John Miller", trying to keep his men alive as they engage in a mission that even he himself has trouble believing in. Another great performance by a fine young actor named Barry Pepper, as the talented sniper who quotes scripture as he disposes of his enemies. This film grabs a hold of you from the opening scene storming the beach, and doesn't let go until the closing credits and beyond. About the highest endorsement I can give this movie, is that my Grandfather was in the WWII and he saw the film and said that it was as close to being in a war that(hopefully) I would ever get. Kudos to all involved in this amazing motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I even begin? Well, maybe I'll start by saying that this is the best movie ever made. I don't know how Spielberg did it, but this movie captures you like no other. Maybe it's his brilliant usage of hand-held cameras, but during the battle scenes, you feel like you're there. You feel like you are in the battle. Veterans who saw the movie said that the only thing missing is the smell of gunpowder.Many have criticized Spielberg's use for making the movie so violent. They said the film is just too bloody. Wrong! Spielberg always trys to go for realism, and that's exactly what he does. The film is gory because the war was gory. That's the way things happen on D-Day.The film definitely deserves the Oscar. It is the most powerful piece of work ever put on the screen. Can you honestly do any better?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made. Not only has Spielberg outdone himself, he has outdone every war movie since. Never before have i seen a movie that is so powerful, gutwrenching, and brutal. Yeah the movie has flaws, doesn't every other great movie. The flaws in this movie are minor, who cares about the framing sequence at the beginning. Spielberg was just setting us up for what was about to happen. After that the movie picks up speed and never slows down. The d-day sequence is the best combat footage ever shot on film, if that half hour doesn't affect in some way then you're crazy. The way spielberg films it is amazing, using hand held cameras to capture the terror and chaos that reigned on omaha beach that day. The acting is superb, tom hanks is a lock for his third academy award. The supporting characters also do a great job, tom sizemore as sarge, jeremy davies as upham. The end battle is also filmed superbly by spielberg. Not as intense as the beginning battle, but a close second. So to the people who thought this movie was overrated, guess you're too much hooked on hamburger hill. Unlike that movie, saving private ryan will be around for a very,very,very, long time. Congraulations Mr.Spielberg, second academy is definitely yours.</fullReview>

One can see the the passion and excellent story telling/direction qualities of this film. The audience feels as if they are a part of the action. Its documentary-look makes us believe it is real, we perceive it to be real with the excellent and original style of camera work, the high quality sound effects, and the entire authenticity of the look and design in every way. Spielberg focuses on showing us the casualties of war - as if we were there and seeing helpless 'lives' of people diminish in many disastrous ways in combat. Watch every detail of this film, listen to all the sounds as you will actually feel like going through D-Day. Especially the last scenes, as we wait for the Nazi tiger tank to approach. Its deep engine sounds will make your stomach tremble as if it was the TREX approaching. This film is a master piece of film work - a milestone in film making. Email: mirage@world.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his self-imposed 5 year exile from film, Steven Spielberg returns with a graphic account of World War Two and eight men's mission to find one man. The film's beginning is one of the most realistic and drainingthat I have seen. The US marines land on Omaha beach to a constant barrage of fire from German troops on the cliffs. It's a truly graphic part of the film and one which holds your attention with masterful use of the camera. A recurring piece of cinematic genius in the film is when the camera focuses on Captain Miller (Hanks) and the sound is distorted. It's a terrible dream-like moment of being as his face shows he cannot comprehend why he is there. Another scene is when Sgt Jackson (Barry Pepper) is attempting to shoot down a sniper which has already claimed the life of one of his comrades. The shot is reversed and we see the view of the German sniper-shooter. It's a thrilling piece of cinema. It is a film which underlines the futility and horror of war but also mixes in the humour which kept up the men's moral, e.g. FUBAR, and the bets they place on their captain telling them about himself. A superb example of brilliant cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the most talked and written about movies of the last decade, and I felt I had to share with the world what I think about this motion picture.Let me start by telling you that, from the moment I left the theatre, I knew that this movie would haunt me for some time and I was right. Steven Spielberg has really pushed the envelope of film-making for the years to come. With a style and courage which is becoming his trade-mark (who else had the guts to make a disaster movie about a seven foot fish or shoot a big studio production in black and white?)The opening scene is often called brilliant but had little to do with the rest of the movie. I believe those 24 minutes were as essential to the movie as sound is. Those 24 minutes showed us that the men who surrvived that torment to tell the rest of the story, could only do so not because they where brave, or skilled, but because they where plain lucky. Every single scene after that sequence was covered with a blanket of dreadfulness, never to be sure who`s next.Then the story about the men. To some, they weren't very convincing. I believe that they were supported with enough information to give an audience with a bit of imagination the tools to fill-in the blanks. It`s not King Lear we are looking at but regular joes, the kind you would sit next to on a bus and never care to notice, as in fact the same kind of people who saved my country. That`s why I don`t have a problem with the American flag waving at the closing scene. It`s not a patriotic gesture, but a pale witness of unnecessary loss of good men, men like our grandfathers, fathers and brothers.</fullReview>

It was the P-51 tankbuster airplane.This movie is classic from start to finish. You can't walk away unaffected.I also feel the criticism saying the bookend cemetery scenes was unnecessary is crap.

		<shortDescription>Hyperbolically overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sympathies to the authors of the few comments critical of this film. You are not alone. The legion of fans this movie has accumulated seem to treat its detractors like Martians.The film is hysterically overrated, and even the Omaha Beach sequence isn't all its cracked up to be. As someone who has seen a lot of Italian horror movies, the graphic violence didn't affect me. Some might think the comparison is inappropriate, but this is a MOVIE, after all, not actual battle footage. Critics droning on about the "realistic", "authentic", "true-to-life" depiction of the "horrors of war" are responding more to the DreamWorks press kit than to the film itself, since I can't imagine many walked out of the theater thinking to themselves "that's exactly how I remember WWII".Regarding Spielberg's teachings on the "horrors of war" (a subject so well-covered in movies it sounds like a cliche), it's nothing you can't get from scores of other films from directors like Ford, Aldrich, Coppola, Lean, Stone, etc. and you're better served by most of them. I'd especially suggest Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory or almost any of Sam Fuller's WWII or Korean war films. The only thing SPR has on any of them is gore.The drama between the (type) characters is hackneyed and hollow, John Williams' score is slopped on like emotional fingerpainting, and the politics are infantile and shallow. The action sequences are OK, but not as good as the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg's most original WWII film remains 1941.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bottom line is, this is not a work of art, in any capacity. I enjoy Spielberg's work most of the time, especially in genres that people generally treat with disrespect, such as sci-fi (Jurassic, ET) and action (Indiana Jones movies), so I'm not some guy trying to put down a successful director. And I'm not anti-patriotic by any means, either. I just don't think it takes a movie with some blood to make me realize that war is bad.Good art has an implicit meaning, from which you can learn something. This film has an explicit meaning, "war is bad," and all those who go out to see the big famous movie take for granted that it must be good, because it's about America and how war is bad, which is of course a very powerful message that younger people might not understand. It's a sad fact that Americans don't understand art anymore, and the popularity of this trash is proof.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is an interesting film. As far as basis in fact goes, this movie rests on the truthful scale somewhere between "Titanic" and "Star Wars". About the only thing Spielberg got right was the fact that there was a war going on at the time. He owes both the Niland and Sullivan families very sincere apologies for butchering what he originally claimed was "their true story".I had a harder time judging this movie on a reality scale. In some ways, the movie was very gripping and realistic, but in other ways, Spielberg failed miserably. In Spielberg's WWII, there were two groups of people. The horrible, murdering Nazis, and the good ol' boys of the US. I may be biased because I currently reside in Canada, but I know that there were probably just as many Canadian (not to mention British and others) troops roaming around during WWII. I admit they did do a tolerable job on the WWII ambience, but did very poorly on creating a realistic military environment.Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, and well worth every penny it cost to see eight times in the theater (eight different groups of friends), but I wouldn't laud it as a fabulous war film, nor would I use it to teach military history, as some schools are considering doing. There were two things that really hurt the movie; 1) Spielberg's Hollywoodization of the film and his insistance on hiring over-aged big-name actors; 2) Spielberg's insistance (until recently) that Saving Private Ryan was a "true story". Spielberg would have done better hiring some relatively unknowns and making clear the film was fiction. It may have just been me, but seeing Matt Damon as Private Ryan made me wish they had just left him there. Matt Damon was the Hollywood heart-throb after "Good Will Hunting", and it was so obvious it was Spielberg's way of pulling in the teen crowd. I was surprised he didn't hire the DiCaprio boy."Saving Private Ryan" wasn't the best film of the year, but it was by no means the worst. I recommend it to anyone over 18 who is looking for an entertaining, hard-hitting way to pass three hours. The scenes on the beach really are well done and excellently written (makes it easy to overlook the mistakes), and while the movie does drag at times, it's worth taking a look-see. I would not suggest allowing children to see this movie, because many of the scenes are highly graphical and highly disturbing. I have no plans on letting my children see this film until they're old enough to understand that film isn't reality, and that Saving Private Ryan is just as fictional as most war films ("G. I. Jane", "Courage Under Fire", etc). If military films are a real interest, I would suggest either adaptation of "The Thin Red Line". It is more realistic than "Saving Private Ryan", and as opposed to the fictional Saving Private Ryan, "The Thin Red Line" has a high basis in fact.</fullReview>

Although the Germans probably had a few more years fighting experience, the Americans were also not without experience. Remember, at that point in the war, the Americans had been in the thick of it for a couple years too. The scenario of a small number of troops fighting well against a larger army has been repeated numerous times throughout history.

		<fullReview>The subjective viewpoint of this film gives it a power we can only imagine from reading about war. Spielberg's use of experimental shutters in his cameras, his use of bleached and muted color and a masterful sound mix recreate the shock and utter hellishness of combat. The audience is put in the center of the action and knows what it is like to experience Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, and the fighting across Normandy in the weeks after.Casting is superb. Each and every actor in this film is utterly perfect, from Tom Hanks through the veteran Harve Presnell in a powerful cameo appearance. The scenes of present-day Ryan visiting the cemetery cause me to appreciate anew the sacrifices of my father's generation. Do I prize highly enough what was done so I might inhabit this world free of Hitler and his Nazi evil? God help me, I hope I do.The screenplay brilliantly introduces elements at perfectly timed intervals to underscore the physical, emotional and mental suffering war inflicts. It is the demon face of war.I ask my British cousins to not feel neglected or slighted in any way by this film. The story's focus is on Americans in Normandy, June 6-15, 1944. It could have been a movie about British, Canadian or Free French forces, but it is not. It in no way diminishes, overlooks or ignores British or other Allied contributions and sacrifices, without which victory certainly would not have been accomplished.Steven Spielberg deserves the thanks of every one on this planet for so clearly defining the central issues of war in general and specifically what is arguably the defining moment of the twentieth century, World War II. Let the Oscar balloting reflect Spielberg's contribution to the world and to the motion picture industry.</fullReview>

The man undoubtedly is -- there are huge scenes in both Schindler's List and in this picture which no one could have captured in such a beautifully, emotionally, real and startling way. But what the hell is with the framing of this story?! We have a film that, as any good war film should, brings up challenging questions about the motivations and morals of war. And, granted, it is the auteur's privelege to hint subtly at what he believes the right answers to those questions might be. But please, PLEASE, don't hit us over the head so you can make the ending "neat." Everything always has to wrap up so nicely with Speilberg that you wonder where all that realism went. If he thinks we were mature enough to handle the intense violence of the opening thirty minutes, then why can't we also be mature enough to decide for ourselves (and grapple a bit with the ideas presented), whether or not Ryan's life was "worth it"? To see the first and last five minutes of this movie is to understand why this film does not deserve the Oscar everyone so absently wants to give it. Call me bitter, but I'd rather watch The Longest Day anyday of the week over this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing here almost out of desperation. I seem to be the only one left in the world that didn't really like Saving Private Ryan. And although the other comments here were encouraging, I still feel slightly at a difference with them. Because I didn't dislike the movie because of its cinematic defects - I just disliked it because of the message it sent about war.Now, I've been told that I'm being too hard on Spielberg. After all, Saving Private Ryan is supposedly less enthusiastic and glorifying about war than any previous movie (I would beg those of this persuasion to re-examine their opinion of Apocalypse Now). But I can't condone this trumpeting of a movie which concludes with a shot of the American flag waving in the sun as being a new representation of war.War isn't about nobility. But Saving Private Ryan is. War is about dirt and sweat and blood and tears and futility. It's about dehumanization and loss. There are no men in war who want to reward a Mrs. Ryan with the gift of the only son she's got left. Only men who want to claim strategic posts.Elements of these things sometimes appear in Saving Private Ryan. But they disappear again in favour of a close-up of Tom Hanks' sad-but-surviving facial expression, or an old frail man standing proud at a war grave. Any attempt at reality is then lost.The performances are good - but everyone seems to be tripping over each other to appear the most ordinary. Although this was probably an attempt at allowing the viewer to identify the soldier with the boy-next-door, it ends up sacrificing character depth in favour of surface considerations.All of this is not to say that Saving Private Ryan is awful, and could even be called a step in the right direction. The movie has a good premise and hits some strong notes - especially in the strange conjecture of risking the lives of five men to find one. The problem is, like all war movies to date, it tries to make sense out of what is happening to the people onscreen. Give them a goal, a purpose, and it will seem like the horror that was, was a horror that had to be.The problem is that in doing that, Saving Private Ryan fails to say anything we haven't heard before. It's not that I don't believe good things can happen in war - it's just that I don't believe only good things can happen. And with Saving Private Ryan, cinema failed once again to take that stance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A specific American story about universal horrors...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film from top to bottom. I have to disagree with other reviewers (and there have been many) who claim the film is overly patriotic in tone. Have they noticed that the American flag shown at the beginning and end of the film looks washed out, almost bled down? I'm sure this is no accident. I felt that there was a message in that curiously colorless flag. I somehow knew the instant that flag was shown that there were some bad things to come. It said to me that patriotism is a little hollow in light of the fearsome carnage that people are put through in a war. As for the flag being American, well it was an American beach and the choice of the U.S. symbol is entirely appropriate. I would expect the Maple Leaf on Juno, or the Union Jack on Sword or Gold beaches. This movie isn't really about D-day in a grand sense anyway.I also disagree with those who say the "bookends" (boy do they love that term) with the old man at the beginning and end are unnecessary. Maybe it's just me, but his reaction doesn't seem overly dramatic in light of what transpires for him in this story (and other things that happened to many people for real) The thing of it is, it seemed absolutely necessary to point the finger squarely at this generation of people. We have a bad habit of shrugging off or even never bothering to learn what it meant to live through those days and times. They're old men now, they look a lot like that old man in the film. Shouldn't the mantle rest on their shoulders? Be honest now, aren't you glad it was theirs and not yours to bear? Give credit where credit is due. I think that this is a specific American story aimed at everyone everywhere. Not an American story aimed at only Americans. I would dearly love to see an honest treatment of the horrors of the Eastern front, for both the Germans and the Russians and the hordes of desperate souls trapped between them. Now that would be graphic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a monumental film. As proof of that claim, I offer two points to ponder. Firstly, look at the number of user comments on this site. Few other films contained herein have inspired such a reaction (good or bad, it makes no difference). People simply do not take the time or effort to make so many comments on a film of minor importance. Secondly, the comments made represent just about every opinion and point of view conceivable. Many movies on this site are referred to as both the best and worst films ever made by the people who send in their comments. Usually, those opinions display a number of recurring themes and tend to form a pattern. Not so for SPR. The comments I've read run the full spectrum of criticisms, some of them highly contradictory. Only a truly monumental film can garner this type and degree of reaction, and draw such a diverse response from so many. Some of the greatest films ever made have continued to be controversial for long periods after their release. "2001:A Space Oddysey" is a good example. It's still loved, hated and misunderstood by hordes of people. Love SPR or hate it, it appears to bear the same stamp of indefinability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The silence said it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that hit me the most after seeing this movie was the way that the audience, upon the turning on of the theater lights, simply rose as one and walked silently out of the theater. Not more than a word was said, and I think that's the best compliment anyone can give this movie. Out of all the teenagers and Gen-Xers that were in the theater, not one of us felt compelled to speak after watching this. I can say that the opening sequence hit me harder than anything I have ever witnessed in my (albeit short) life. I found myself wrapping my arms around my knees, trying to hide my eyes but unable to avoid the horror unfolding on the screen. I actually felt like somehow I was in danger. The horror I felt as the soldiers stepped out of the boats into the gunfire was gut-wrenching. All the movies we watch in school, all the History Channel specials don't even touch what this movie touched, honestly. I never realized the horror of what D-Day and this war was until I saw this movie. It took it out of the abstract and forced those of us who have never had to live through a real war to see it as they did. It makes me want to thank every one of the men who were in this war for what they sacrificed for those of us who live here now. I don't know if I would be strong enough to handle it, and I hold as my heroes anyone who was.About the movie in itself, I actually thought the scenes at the beginning and end were touching. A bit too theatrically staged, definitely, but I thought it was a nice beginning and end for the movie. The battle scenes, enough said. Phenomenal. The one and only criticism I have is that I think the script was a little weak in its character development. I had a hard time really feeling for the characters, and I think that maybe the battle scenes were emphasized so much that we lost who the men really were. It's hard to develop characters while the audience is concentrating on gunfire. However, this was an excellent, excellent movie, definitely, a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's only a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm waiting for the second run of SPR so I can see it for a third time. This is not to say I loved this film or consider it to be the great masterpiece so many have over-hyped it to be. I happen to love historical epics and WWII is my favorite history subject along with the rarity of this type film these days makes it the more desirable for me to view. I do concur with all the rave about the opening beach landing being an intense awe-inspiring film experience however the remaining two plus hours of the film are quite ordinary and only the exciting battle at the conclusion of the film rescues SPR from being a dull disappointment. I also find the battle at the end of the film to be a contradiction to the opening battle and confuses the whole message. In the first battle we are in the middle of massive carnage and gore and get the feel of being pinned down and what it's like to fear moving an inch and being killed but if you don't move you will be killed anyway! There is no false heroics only desperate men trying to stay alive and do their job. This better than any battle I've seen on film convinces me that I don't want any part of combat and there is nothing glorious about it and those that endured through it deserve our greatest admiration and respect which I believe is the primary message in the film. The conclusion however resembles the rousing old adventure war films of the past. Capt. Miller has found Ryan and has orders to bring him back to be sent home and this is his mission but instead he is talked into defending an important bridge by Ryan who doesn't want to abandon his comrades. We are then treated to an exhilarating battle that does not nearly match the terror and gore of the first and all the old W.W.II movie clichés start to show up. The rock hard sergeant who feels no pain no matter how many times he is shot, Ryan and his honorable loyalty to his men refusing to go home without having to risk his life any longer and of course the cavalry saving the day at the end when all appears lost !? I have a problem with films today dealing with war in that they go out of there way to try and convey too many messages as I believe there is a fear that its no longer politically correct or acceptable to make a war film for the sake of entertainment. I do believe there have been some great war films with a message such as Paths Of Glory and Go Tell The Spartans and others but there have been far too many that try too hard to preach war is hell and so on and SPR is one of them. I'm not ashamed to say that I prefer films like The Longest Day and Where Eagles dare as they are more entertaining and far more successful at what they are trying to be. No film today tomorrow or a hundred years from now will ever convey the horror of war or will impact society's view of war alone. Twenty years from now some other war film will come along and SPR will seem tame in comparison but it will still just be a movie like SPR is. I went to see SPR for the action and my W.W.II interest and was compelled only by those two things not the weak story line or pretentious messages and syrupy drama. SPR is a good film because of two great action pieces that hold up the long message laden middle and if it wasn't for the cliched conclusion and Ryan simply returned to the rear this film would not be seen by as many people who would have been disappointed by a anti-climactic non action conclusion which is the primary reason people view war films to see combat action not be preached at about how horrible war is !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best War Movie Ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, ok... you say: "This film is full of cliches and Platoon is the best." I've seen Platoon, and I've seen other war movies and no one has touched me more than Spielberg's masterpiece SPR. And why? Because, when I watched the others, I was just watching. When I went to the movies to see SPR, I WAS THERE. I could feel the war in me... I could feel all that human strength fighting against something they did not even know.Cliche? I'll tell you what is a cliche in a war movie: the man is shot and in slow motion camera he cries and falls on the ground. His friends stop to look at him, and the bullets stop to be shot to them. The dying man says: "Please, tell my girlfriend I love her... i wanted to have been a better man, i wanted to..." (and he dies) At this moment, the viewer's eyes are full of tears and the director of this movie has done what he wanted to: make the viewer cry in a classic war scene. In Spielberg's SPR, the same scene happens like this: the man is shot in real motion camera, he cries, falls on the ground and doesn't stop crying, looking at his body, drowning blood everywhere, desperated, unable to think about her girlfriend. Only one thing passes through his mind "I'm gonna die". He cries it... His friends stop to look at him and are shot too, some lose a leg, some just a foot, others an arm... and the scene left the viewer shocked, and sure that THAT IS WAR, THAT IS REAL.Of course, Mr. Spielberg committed his mistakes in this movie, as anyone commits in any other film: the opening scene (the old man) is unnecessary, just as the final one. The American flag should be filmed, (after all, Spielberg is a patriot, too) but why forget Canada, France and England flags? R the Americans the only saviors of the world? And, at last, the stereotyped German... why not choose a German with a family, with integrity, honor? Why must they always be bad? I'm sorry to say it to someone so closed-mind as Robert Rodat, but in a war, you don't fight against ONE German, you fight against a country. That German could be GENE KELLY Singing in the rain, but he would still be an enemy. So, why make him BAD?If you see, the mistakes committed in this movie r not Spielberg's. They r from the screenplayer, the writer. I don't think SPR deserves the Oscar for best Screenplay, but Spielberg is the best director and SPR DOES deserve the title of best 1998 movie, if not, as Academy is so imprevisible and unjust to S Spileberg, may people, at least, make this film eternal, eternal as the remembrances of the worst tragedy men could live in this century: WWAR II!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was taken to this movie by my 79-yr-old grandfather, a World War II veteran who had read the reviews declaring this movie to be "based on a true story", and a truly epic movie about WWII. He couldn't wait to see this movie that was heralded by Spielberg and others as a bonafide docudrama, a true story based on a young man in WWII who lost three brothers to death behind enemy lines, and the most stunning war movie to ever hit Hollywood's silver screen.Both he and I were shocked by the brutal reality of the scenes on the beach. That was truly amazing cinematography and imagery by Spielberg. Sure, both he and I noticed the many unrealistic aspects of even these scenes, minor errors in small details, but my grandfather said those scenes were closer to the reality than any movie had come yet.But both my grandfather (a veteran and retired military historian) and I (a hobby historian) noticed the movie soon changed. While the movie was without a doubt strong with feeling an imagery, the realism is soon gone. The soldiers are out of character, the special effects overdone, and the military equipment (particularly the Tiger tanks) used/referenced incorrect. The worst part was that this movie, heralded as a "true story" didn't have enough truth in it to fill an eye-dropper.This movie was not, however, a failure. Spielberg did an excellent job at creating a fictitious storyline that almost seems like it was real, and then used the Hollywood glitz and glamour to create his version of WWII. This movie is extremely well done for a war movie, and well worth watching as long as the viewer remembers two important things: 1) This movie is NOT real. 2) This movie is NOT a true story. There was no Pvt. Ryan. This movie is *extremely* loosely based on the losses of two families in WWII -- the Nilands, who lost two of their four sons (one was MIA and later found, and the other wandered around in enemy territory for 18 days before finding his way back to camp and being told he was being sent home), and the Sullivans, who lost all five of their sons in a 1942 loss at sea. (For more on those five, watch the film "The Sullivans".) Neither situation involved what was seen in the film.This movie should be rated on three separate scales. The only true rating for this movie can be on it's ability to entertain and hold the viewers interest (nine out of ten by both my grandfather and I). For its rating on realistically portraying the general conditions on WWII, it measures about a six and a half, and on its realism as far as "based on a true story", this movie deserves a zero, because it is entirely fictionalised.Definitely see this movie, but if you're looking for realism in a 1998 war film, check out "The Thin Red Line". Both its storyline and its basic cinematography is more "realistic" and "true". It is only for true war buffs though -- the movie rates high for both realism and truth, but fairly low for entertainment value because of Malick's attempt at keeping it realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, "Saving Private Ryan" is more than the greatest war film ever. It was an experience that has left an indelible mark on my psyche. And I'm sure it would do the same for most who see it.This film opens our eyes and makes us truly aware of the utter brutality and nightmare that is War. People who see this film should realize that war is nowhere near glorious; in fact, it shows us that war should be the last thing that any of us, even "Hawks," would want to experience.I came away from this film with a new respect and appreciation for those people who actually experienced combat like that seen in this film. I can't believe they had the will to do anything more than curl up in a fetal position and simply wait for the fighting to end before moving.In short, this film does something that needs to be done more often--it de-glorifies war, but glorifies the courage exhibited by anybody that's ever put on a uniform and fought for their country.Everybody should see this film. Either to appreciate the heroism it takes just to stand on a battlefield, let alone fight on it. Or to reconsider their thoughts when confronted about the prospect of war.Thank You, Mr. Spielberg, for opening our eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anti war it is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have to disagree with the idea that Ryan is an anti war movie, let alone the best ever. it was well shot, and in parts well acted but i found it repulsively right wing. when the good guys get shot they die painful deaths but when the evil Germans (also human too mr Spielberg, also with families) get shot they fall over like cardboard cut outs. the one german who we get a close look at turns out to be a callous cowardly pig who will happily lie to escape and then shoot the man who showed him respect. moral? never trust a german.tom hanks was miscast, his character should not have been there, tom sizemore would have made a much better lead. cut out the sentiment, it was cloying and pointless. also there was the deliberate misleading scene at the beginning. old man sees tombstone and thinks back.... back.... back to the beaches where he suddenly becomes tom hanks. well we know he doesn't die then, because he was the one at the beginning. oh how clever he was really ryan. that flag waving at the beginning was almost a joke, even Capra would have balked at that. drop the prologue and epilogue please it was dire. "tell me i'm a good man." the whole finding the wrong ryan bit was guff and a waste of time too because we all knew dopey matt damon was ryan. on that subject, brave ryan refuses to leave his boys but when the shooting starts what does he do? crouch down and start crying! surely a coward like him would have jumped ship at the first opportunity. another big mistake was casting ted danson, the whole cinema said "ooh it's ted danson in a wig" in unison. next up at that point could well have been a madonna cameo as edith piaf in a dream sequence.the opening battle sequence was some of Spielberg's best work since Jaws. without a doubt great cinema, but what was the point? it bore no relation to the story and was not anti war either. it was anti being shot, portraying the horrors of being blown up. war was not condemmed, the question of soldiers on both sides being unwitting pawns was never raised and the film was totally lacking a moral centre. war was a matter of the good people overcoming the bad people and if that meant killing them with no remorse (anyone in the film troubled by the horror?) then it was done in the name of (the) right (wing). unfortunately by making the opening so realistic Spielberg has succeeded in passing the whole thing off as history so another generation of americans and anyone else who has not studied history will think that the war between america and germany started in 1941. would it have been too much trouble to include some british, french or any other european soldiers. and correct me if i'm wrong but i'm sure there were black soldiers in WWII, but i must have missed them in this film.yes i left the cinema angry, angry that such a good opportunity was wasted with pro american revisionist flag waving claptrap. and if tom hanks gets another oscar for being wet and dying then i will handing mine back to the academy.</fullReview>

Apply it with a hammer. Add 1 American flag just to make sure.)No, the scene that affected me most was the death of the Jewish soldier, almost gently "put to sleep" by his sworn German enemy in the room (religiously peaceful) in the midst of battle.

At least they know what they are talking about.And maybe, just maybe war makes people stereotypes. It's not like ordinary life eh?Spielberg really hit the vein with this one. Keep up the good work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hits home but Speilberg goes overboard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't consider myself a squeamish person at all but sitting through this movie became an endurance test for me. I knew when I walked into the cinema that this wasn't going to be a nice film but I was still completely shocked at the opening Omagh Beach sequence. I realise that some people need to see this film and understand that war is futile and horrific etc but I found being flung into the middle of the slaughter, surround sound full blast, quite a distressful experience. No wonder war veterans watching this film could only last 10 minutes. I know Spielberg has to hit home and it really does and I know that a lot of men died and how messed up and bloody the operation was but I knew that anyway and personally would rather not know what a person looks like when they are shot/blown up into little pieces. But despite that I'm glad in a way that I saw the film as I was with Schindlers List and can appreciate what the veterans went through for us and how grateful we should be. It's one of those films that isn't pleasant one little bit but you should see it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies that I have ever seen. From the opening scenes on D-Day to the finale at American bridgehead, the movie never lost a beat in its portrayal of the American fighting men. What I liked about the movie was its simplicity of message. It attempts to historically document a time in history without much of the underlying political messages. Men did not fight for honor or courage like some of Hollywood's creations would lead us to believe. They did not fight to purposely crush the enemy or defeat Hitler. GI's fought for themselves and the survival of their fellow men. Saving Private Ryan also dispelled many of the myths of war. Anyone who thinks war is glorious and glamorous needs to experience Spielberg's masterpiece. War is not fun; it is hell, and Spielberg conveyed that message very clearly in the opening battle scenes. Men were being machine-gunned without knowing what had happened to them. Yet there were moments in the movie where I felt that I had forgotten about the war. For example, before the final battle scene at the bridgehead, American GI's were swapping back and forth stories about the homefront. War definitely has moments of comradeship as portrayed by Spielberg. Overall, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Steven Spielberg creates yet another masterpiece. I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone (except small children, of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg takes a giant leap forward as a filmmaker with this amazing movie. Beyond "entertainment," this film actually left me examining my own place and responsibility in the world. Lured in by a typically cliched Hollywood war-film plot ("we've got to save Pvt. Ryan... for his Mama!") that plays to our most romanticized notions of war, the film instead devolves into the incoherent, bloody mess war actually is, and finally, with the closing scenes, attains an allegorical plateau as it makes its true point - that we are all "Private Ryan," enjoying lives of pleasure and freedom thanks to the thousands of common men who united 50 years ago to destroy the most evil human endeavor of modern times. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to see a movie like Saving Private Ryan incomplete. It is a masterpiece of a film but it could have been the greatest film ever made. It is not. Spielberg was so close and yet Saving Private Ryan is not quite the movie it should be. Don't get me wrong, it is an impressive film and I'm glad I paid to go see it. The opening sequence on the beach is utterly perfect - there are no other words to describe it, and Tom Hanks actually performs a role that is definitely Oscar worthy (Philadelphia was overrated). But there are mistakes Spielberg makes: The opening and closing shots of the American flag - (didn't Spielberg see Minghella's 'The English Patient'?), the use of the older Ryan attending the graveyard - completely unnecessary - Spielberg should have left it during WWII; and finally the character focus on Ryan - I had more interest in the Corporal Upham character played brilliantly by Jeremy Davies. I felt that at times Spielberg was doing so but then he switched back to Hanks and Damon's characters. It would have proved more effective to use Davies' character as the main protagonist. But enough of the criticising - it is nevertheless still a fine film and I think the only reason I find myself picking at these little things is my disappointment in the fact that it could have been one of the greatest films ever - and fell just a few feet short of it.</fullReview>

How dare you take a film that is so much based on true events like "Saving Private Ryan" and dismiss it like it is just another "cinematic experience?!?"Some of you seemed disappointed about the amount of gore portrayed in this film, saying that it was nothing more than a bunch of arms and legs getting blown off. Have people REALLY gotten this narrow-minded? Are your convictions with Steven Spielberg so fierce that you have to ignore the fact that ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU ARE SEEING IN THE DOOMSDAY SCENE IS BASED ON FACTUAL ACCOUNTS?!? Were you the same people who said "Schindler's List" should not have been made by Spielberg simply because he was not a Holocaust survivor?!? Well, grow up!You don't have to call "Saving Private Ryan" the best film ever made. You don't even have to LIKE it. But at the very least you should take a mature action and RESPECT it. This is not a game, people. It has to do with your very right to walk free today, over fifty years after so many thousands of people sacrificed their lives so that we may live free. This is NOT "Indiana Jones and World War II," so stop pretending like it is.My grandfather fought in WW II and he would be to say the least, insulted by some of the harsh comments mentioned here. For the many thousands of veterans and Americans like him, keep your wasteful opinions to yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very realistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most realistic war movie that has probably ever been produced. Realistic, in that sometimes I felt that I was actually in there ducking, dodging, running and crawling. As they were waiting at the bridge for the tanks it gave an eerie feeling. I am not a veteran so I can only imagine, the "waiting" for the enemy which you know is coming would be quite harrowing, as against being in the thick of the action where you don't get time to worry.Purists may complain that certain events would not have happened, but those are just technicalities that do not detract from it being a superb film.(to the layman in any case) Although, I think I spotted a mistake too. (not a military or historical one, just a minor production one) Just before they came across the guarded radar, there was a long distance shot of them walking across a field in formation. I counted 8 of them. (It looks like the filmclip used when they first began their mission.)War veterans don't like to talk about some of their experiences, and having watched this movie I can understand why. Many would have seen and done things that they now regret, such as murdering prisoners of war, acts of cowardice, the making of crucial decisions that resulted in the loss of our mens lives, inaction or hesitation and just being plain "scared".Other war veterans would have many painful memories of the loss of friends and relatives, and just the ugliness and horrors of war.I understand that the age range of those that went to war were 18 to 21yr olds. Unbelievable! They were just "kids".This movie has an R16 rating, however I have no worries about my 11 and 9 year old daughters viewing it, when it comes out on video.For the realistic depiction I give it a 10 out of 10. For this movie I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, "Saving Private Ryan" is a film of great integrity and honesty. For the bulk of the breezy three hour length, I thought that Spielberg had enough trust in his material to allow it to stand on its own. No such luck. In the final minute of the film, Spielberg unleashes a scene that is so melodramatic and manipulatingly cloying that it severely undercuts an otherwise fine film. Spielberg needs to learn that his movies can have a powerful message and leave a lasting impression without having to tell the audience what he wants them to get from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than anything else, I believe that eliminating the above myth (ref: summary, above) was the thesis Spielberg was trying to communicate to the so-called ''allies'' and especially the American public. When one looks at the attempt at glamour, beginning with TV shows that trivialised the so-called "good war'' in the 1960s (e.g. ''Hogan's Heroes'', ''McCale's Navy''), not to mention a warehouse full of WW2 flicks where soldiers fought with clean uniforms on dirty beaches -- cranked into production beginning not long after the Japanese surrendered aboard ship with two nuclear holes where cities once sat -- one can certainly understand why Spielberg felt the need to bring home this long-overdue message.Oliver Stone and others have already reminded us of how horrible was Vietnam, and the DMZ on the Korean peninsula is a living reminder of that war, but WW2 remained glamourised until relatively recent times. While the first 20 minutes of ''Saving Private Ryan'', following a brief but touching introduction, have received much ''press'' -- and indeed that stretch of film is quite an ordeal for the viewer having ANY level of sensitivity whatsoever to get through -- it is the remainder of the film that will convince you utterly that war of any kind is a useless waste. Kudos go in abundance to Spielberg &amp; Co. and one quickly envisages at least 6-7 Oscar nominations on the way, to include ''Best Actor'' (Tom Hanks -- who just keeps getting better and better with age), Spielberg for ''Best Director'', and the film itself for ''Best Picture''. Top rating (5 stars of 5) -- make that six!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm happy so many people have seen this film, and am also quite happy to see many different opinions expressed as to the merits of "Saving Private Ryan." I myself thought the movie was quite exceptional. I enjoy the film for it's honesty. This isn't a film with a political agenda (such as the "War turns innocent children into mindless killers" of Stone's "Platoon," or the corny pro-American schmaltz of "The Green Berets")... Any governmental politics would have definitely hampered this film; instead, it focuses on war and war only. It focuses on the attitudes of soldiers and the fat cats who sent them in to battle. More importantly, SPR is about the thoughts and actions of eight men as they search for Private Ryan: We see them as they're crying, we see them as they're killing, we see them as they're laughing... Encompassing all these facts, the film provides a monumental look at the attitude of Americans towards war back in the day, and the attitude of Americans towards war in the present.The battle sequences at the beginning and ending of the film are some of the most powerful sequences ever caught on celluloid. Yes, they are indeed technical marvels, to be sure... However, to say that the movie depends too much on the technical proficiency of its director is not true in the slightest... The film is exemplary all around. Likewise, to say that this film relies solely on Hanks' star power and Damon's looks is also untrue. The supporting cast, especially Ribisi, Goldberg, and Davies, more than hold their own, if not overshadow the also great performance of Hanks.More importantly, in it's general honesty regarding the attitudes of Americans during and after the war, SPR succeeds in being one of the greatest, if not THE greatest war film ever produced. True, the script is not exactly the greatest ever written, but the raw power of the war sequences, the superb performances from all involved, and the humanity given to all soldiers who fought in this war more than make up for it.And to those of you who denounce it for demonizing Nazis: 1) What of the scene where Davies screams for the release of the bawling German soldier? 2) This movie is shot from the perspectives of those fighting the Nazis; anyone trying to kill you is going to be perceived in a negative light. 3) Remember: The Nazis were the BAD guys.And for those denouncing it for it's solely American perspective: the film followed only eight American soldiers and STILL clocked in at three hours... I'm sure Spielberg would have loved to encompass the entire story of World War II into this film, but I don't think that was quite possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a feeling from reading all these negative messages about the realism of Saving Private that Spielberg has been grossly understood by the majority. Spielberg was not trying to make a super-violent war movie to persuade people from war..he said himself that he hopes after people are done talking about the the first 30 mins on the beach of Normandy that they would talk about what the movie is really about - those WWII veterans, and the sacrifice that they made for us so we can argue whether or not SPR is better than Thin Red Line. I have never been so affected by a movie. All I hear is people arguing that they didn't know about radar then or that the story is not feasible and so on. These people unfortunately miss the symbolism which is deeply rooted in this movie. This movie cannot be summed up as it is too complicated - like a person. Many feelings and thoughts went into this feel and they all come out. I do feel that this is a truly great movie and the best one I have ever seen.I admit that it is a very American movie....but I do believe that the French, Canadians and English can relate.... Saving Private Ryan is grossly misunderstood in its characters. I have heard a lot of talk about how they are stereo-types and such.....hardly so but none the less these thoughts are distracting you from the true meaning of this film. And please forgive me for rambling on. =))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One film that deserves to win over 10 Academy Awards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released back in July and it's lost a lot of it's hype recently, but that dosen't mean it should be overlooked. Some of the comments are very pathetic given about this film, "horrible plot" makes no sense whatsoever since it was based on a true story, "relies on special effects" is total B.S. because what other way are you gonna make war more realistic, and the "bad acting" ones had to go. It may have been a little too long and some scenes may have made the movie much better if they were shortened (ie, church scene) but that doesn't stay away from the importance of the film.The first 25 minutes of the film are going to remembered as probably the best war scene ever created. It was brutal, grotesque, disturbing, breathtaking, gruesome, horrifying, so many words can't describe the visuals you see during the D-Day experience Spielburg gives us. And if that didn't give you the anti-war feeling then the next 10 minutes to see the mother's reaction when she finds out 3 of her 4 boys died is sure to be enough. The first 1/3 of this film stab you with any type of emotion that can ever be put into a war film.The next 45 minutes of the film have a few scenes that drag on to give strong characterization to understand the 8 men army out looking for Private Ryan. Some may feel bored during a few parts even though I found them necessiry. But during this 45 minutes of the film to see French people trying to live in their torn apart homes during the war and to see the hundreds of dog-tags the soldiers looked through are still dramatic. And when the medic dies toward the end of this section of the film is another scene capable of bringing tears to the eyes.The last 1/3 of the movie never lets up. They soon find Private Ryan and when they decide to stay and help him and his platoon fight off the German forces leads to a dramatic climax which goes on just as long as the opening D-Day experiance. This scene has a much larger battlefield and the soldiers aren't running in to battle like the opening and are rather spread apart to let us know each characters reaction to the war they are fighting in. The conclusion is just almost as sad as the scenes during the opening and definitely get across the message that war is hell.It has recently been announced that SPR will return to theaters shortly along with another WWII film The Thin Red Line. The Thin Red Line looks very promising to be another war film to receive amazing excellence but it is said that the two films differ drastically in just about every way. I imagine both films will do well at the Academy Awards but Saving Private Ryan definitely deserves over 10 Academy Awards and be another Titanic to go down in history.</fullReview>

The first bit is wonderful realistic and I like seeing someone who at last shows the battle scenes more or less as they where. However it is not as choking as I would have thought by the reviews. It lacks the final shot of realism and the element of chance or coincident.Now chok in these pictures is of course important. You simply have got to go out the cinema either before the ending or with a really bad taste in your mouth! We owe that to the ones who fought and died! And so this film was not "violent" enough! What about the random shootings on the beaches, the lacking accidential killing of fellow soldiers or at least a more sombre ending. Not this more or less happy ending which unfortunately is becoming a Hollywood trademark. But it is a fine movie...........................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my friends and I went to get tickets to this movie, they carded us. We showed them our licenses proving we were over 17 but that theater required someone over 21 to be present. I thought this was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard. Now my father would have to go to the movie with us. Well, once the film started, it only took about 30 seconds for me to realize why they had been so strict about letting us in.My jaw dropped during the chilling D-Day opening sequence and I didn't pick it up off the floor until well past the second unit closing credits. Never before have I been so affected by a film, and so scared. Two of my guy friends, who tend to be very tolerant of blood and gore, were obviously creeped out by the all too realistic graphic depiction of war, not to mention the other girl who was there. I wanted to leave after that opening sequence. To think that my grandfather went through that was too much. I stayed however and witnessed the most daring and realistic depiction of World War II ever put on screen.I left the theater scared to death of war and with a whole new respect for Veterans around the world.

		<shortDescription>World War II meets Indiana Jones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I left the theatre after watching SPR, my first thought was "World War II meets Indiana Jones". There were just too many Spielberg standard cliches in this movie for me to really appreciate his attempt at a "realistic" war movie. The opening 20 minutes was a good attempt at realism, but somehow spoiled by later unbelievable little twists that I found silly. (And seemed more appropriate in a Indiana Jones movie) Yes, some of the things in the movie did happen in real life, but others simply did not, so I question the whole reality thing. If you really want to know what happened, read the eye-witness accounts currently available out there in book stores. I think you'll find some things in the movie accurate, while others far from it. In addition, the movie misses some of the real drama and herosim that went on down on the beaches that day. What about the bravery of General Norman Cota who rallied the men over the beach defenses? What about the role of the Navy Destroyers, whoclosed to within 500 yards of the beach and took out numerous pillboxes with their guns? Those stories should be worth at least a mention, in addition to all the blood and gore thats displayed. (By the way, not all the defenders were German, some were captured Russians, Poles, Czechs and Chinese!!)Still, with all that said, I understand the attempt here at trying to give you the feel of real combat, with all the horror and blood and gore. But ultimately nothing can substitute for the real thing. (Although this movie probably comes closer than any other movie before.) Yet I felt that the display of gore was given too much focus, and that the story was sacrificed in favour of this. I felt something was missing after seeing this movie. In the end, the film-maker tries to make up for this by ending the film with a message. However, the whole film ride to get to that point seems to have little in common to that message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan Rated: R For: Graphic Violence, Adult Langauge, Adult Content Starring: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Ed Burns, Tom Sizmore Directed by: Steven Spielberg Running Time: 2 hours 48 minutesWell, to start off, this movie should not be viewed by children under 15, that is, unless you want to teach your children about the real effects of war. This movie starts off with an older James Ryan at Omaha Beach, his family behind him. He has walked up to the marble gravestones that are placed there in remembrance of the soldiers that dies at D-Day, which he flashes back to. In the flashback (which is simular to Titanic as in it being the whole movie) to the beginning of D-Day, with a shot of Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), and his platoon of soldiers, who, before landing on Omaha, vomit in terror, they hit the beach and two rows of soldiers are taken out, the others dive into the water, a couple drown under the weight of they're equipment, others dying before even hitting the beach. For the first half-hour of this masterpiece, I dare say "masterpiece" because that's what it is, the soldiers go through hell, a mess of blood, dead bodies, and gun fire that'll make you appreciate those that went through that. After that, Captain Miller and his team of soldiers, on the mission to save Private Ryan (Matt Damon), along the way save Ryan, they run into a run down radar tower, a run down town, and several other things which leave them with unexpected loses. And the final battle may be the best, and most prolific in the history of cinema, Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar worthy performance, Steven Spielberg should get an Oscar for best director, and he proves his is the greatest director of our time. Edward Burns, Matt Damon, and Tom Sizemore are also giving great perforances, along with guest appearances by Dennis Farina and Ted Danson, this movie has major star power, a great plot, great dialogue, and a great direction, all-in-all, this gets my vote for best movie of the year. I give it an A+."Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much, my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is I get back to her ... and how I'll ever be able to ... tell about these days like today."

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are some of the most brutal images put on screen. I don't care what you've seen before, this is absolutely shocking. There were times when it was difficult to watch these events flash in front of my eyes. War is not pretty, and Speilberg shows you this in a way that will grab you, a man holding his intestines is crying for his mother, another man who loses an arm confusingly tries to pick it up with his other hand. You know that this is not gonna be a pretty ride.Saving Private Ryan is Speilberg's follow up to last year's highly underrated film, Amistad. Tom Hanks is Captain Miller, who gets word of Private Ryan (Matt Damon), who lost all of his brothers in the war (he still doesn't know it yet), Private Ryan is therefore granted a safe trip back home, and it's up to Captain Miller and seven others to make sure that he makes his return home as soon as possible. The only problem is that they don't know exactly where he is, just somewhere behind enemy lines. The eight begin their journey and on their way each of their characters are revealed, we find out that Captain Miller, as tough as he is, wants nothing more than to get out of the violence and tragedy that he has to deal with everyday. He just wants to return home, as does almost everybody else.Speilberg is in top form again, and although it's not as perfect as his masterpiece, Schindler's List, it does rank as the best film of 1998 (so far). The performances are top-notch and incredibly real, especially Tom Hanks' character.So what can you say? Speilberg has done it again. Never before has war been shown so realistically before. If there is one film that can show the atrocities that soldiers had to go through every day, SPR is the one. Is it the best war film ever made?... I don't think so. But is it a damn good one?... definitely</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Objectively, I consider movies as good and relevant based on the following: a) it is based on true story; b) it has social impact ; and c) flawless. SPR has met all these requirements and even more. Seeing the movie would stir one's imagination, that will stay in one's consciousness for quite sometime. The film is technically excellent and at par with other good war films such as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. Congratulations to Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some filmgoers have short memories when they praise the latest candied-over anti-war-message film as the "best ever". For raw brutal honesty in imaginative film-making what about "Full Metal Jacket" or "Apocalyse Now" or "The Deerhunter" or "Platoon" to mention just a few of the recent entries for best ever. And what about still best of all "All Quiet on the Western Front" (issued 68 years ago in 1930 based on Erich Marie Remarque's novel). All of these better than Spielberg's "Saving P.R. that with his eye as ever more keenly on the box office than on telling the truth he mars with the sentimental patriotism that he laces into it as a hedge on what might not be the overwhelming popularity of his anti-war theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an Officer of Marines and have been waiting for a war to depict war in its entirety. With this movie, the wait is now over. All that is needed is the smell of burning flesh and hair, and one would have a realistic experience of the effects of war. This movie is as real as it gets.I have always wondered why my father (who was a Marine during the Korean War) never mentioned the crazy things that happened to him during his two tours of Korea. He kept these things hidden within him and they only surfaced around loud noises or when the mentioning of his old comrades was brought up in certain circles. You could see the pain and suffering that hit him. The movie's ending followed this as if my dad had written his own autobiography. Watching help myself answer these unknown questions and prepared me more for what my job entitles as a leader of Marines.The best part of watching this movie was doing it near a military base. Opening night the theatre was completely crowded with Marines and their significant others. The Marines enter cocky as usual; proud, confident and ready to see another action war movie. As I watched them leave with a sobbing friend, I could see a new light in their eyes in the understandings of the effects of war. They were able to see the consequences of some of their actions in future situations.</fullReview>

I'm beginning to think he should go back to making children's movies, where his tendency toward cloying sweetness is more excusable.BTW: Private Ryan is not an anti-war movie. It glorifies the sacrifices of the soldiers and romanticizes their heroism. That's the same B.S. the military has been feeding young men for centuries -- a lie that is exposed and villified in All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and The Grand Illusion, among other true anti-war films.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and graphic to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning with the old man was so sappy and melodramatic that the scenes following were a complete shock. It went from after-school special to completely disturbing. I haven't seen a display of such realistic footage in any movie besides Schindlers List ever. After awhile the brutality gets to you where you just have to turn away. What's really sad is the fact that the soldiers on the field didn't have that luxury I had sitting in a movie seat. Besides that scene the movie turned into a flat boring mess. The acting left a lot to be desired as well as the storyline. I really don't believe that the movie would have gotten much hype if it wasn't for the direction of Spielberg and the opening scenes, minus the old man of course. You knew where Spielberg was trying to go with the story but he seemed to take you on a lot of unnecessary detours that could have got the viewer there 1hr earlier. Overall a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really that good of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan's going to take a whole bunch of oscars and probably best picture, but it shouldn't. Okay, it may be a realistic portrayal of war and blah-blah, but let's look at it as a real MOVIE. Tom Hanks doesn't deserve any sort of oscar for this (he was good, but it's nothing Jim Carrey didn't do ten times better in The Truman Show). Matt Damon, let's face it, reeked. Jeremy Davies gave about the only oscar-caliber performance in the whole thing. Any movie that opens with a shot of an american flag can't be too original. It must have been done by fifty other movies. The script was pathetic, with some pretty dumb lines and not much of a story (if the script is even nominated for an oscar, it'll show how low the academy sinks to meet hype.) But every review of the movie gave it 5 out of 4 stars and so-on, and I'm starting to get the feeling this is one of those movies the media almost *forces* you to like, such as Titanic and Forrest Gump. I'm not saying it's not a decent movie. It is very realistic, and the cinematography, sound and art direction is great. Jeremy Davies should at least be nominated for something. And it's one of Spielberg's best directing efforts. But as for being the best war movie of all time.... to this day, nothing compares with Apocalypse Now. And if Saving Private Ryan wins over the Truman Show (heck, over Pleasantville) then there's something seriously wrong. But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of the 1990's - a masterpiece!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most war films have one common denominator or two...they either have a give 'em hell attitude ("The Longest Day"), or they deal with an anti-war theme ("Apocalypse Now"). This film does both...only on a larger scale. It has some fine acting (Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Ted Danson), but that is not how I saw this movie. This movie is about war in all of its infinite inhumanity...and you are there...right at the front lines...watching men brutally dying around you. In "Apocalypse Now", this was shown to a degree...then all of a sudden, we are swept up into a chaotic nightmare about a renegade Colonel who goes over the edge. This film explores war on a more real life scale. When the boats arrive at Omaha Beach...you feel what the soldiers feel. When the men decide to go after Ryan, you feel their courage...and their probable destiny. Movies like "The Deer Hunter", "Coming Home", and "Paths of Glory" all gave us a reason to hate war. This film does the same, however, it explores all of the reasons for wanting to go to war...and fighting for what you believe in. This is Spielberg at his finest...the flip side to Schindler's List. The cinematography, special effects, sound, and score all are done perfectly...a masterpiece of American film making in the last decade of the 20th Century.</fullReview>

Sure, the reference to 'monty' was insulting (and wrong) (my dad had a fit over this)But really...get over it. This movie is not about specifics, but rather the amalgamation of a serious, harsh and at times poignant images. So if you thought the soundtrack was too loud (oh my bleeding heart)I suggest you go home and crank DOWN the Enya music. For those who were disgusted by the brutality, please understand that this was what it was like. War isn't meant to be a nice, warm, fuzzy experience.Lastly...if you thought the movie wasn't a testimony against war...then what the f**k where you watching?</fullReview>

It's no longer in American theaters, but will be released around nomination time next year. For the anti american sector. Like one viewer mentioned. The beach they came ashore on was 100 percent American. So it wasn't anti- rest of the allied forces- like people mention. I grew up with all the old war movies, and you can't tell me this isn't the most honest depiction of war you have ever scene. And the plot to rescue one man. Hell i was in the military, and i've seen stranger crap than this. As 4 the age factor, yeah, most military people are 18 to 21, but if u ever were in the service, the guys that stayed in were mostly in their 30's. It seems once u re-enlist. You stay the whole course in the military. So that explains the age difference. You're either a 1st termer or a lifer, there seems no in between.

		<shortDescription>A new angle on War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am from Israel, used to hear about dead soldiers on the news. When such horrible events happen, the radio starts broadcasting quiet, beautiful songs and a feeling of deep sadness spread. I see in my mind fresh graves, the teary faces of girlfriends, mothers, fathers and fellow soldiers.But after watching Saving Private Ryan, I see other things. Torn flesh. Pools of blood. Shattered bones. Impossibly loud explosions, raising dust and ashes. The cry of the wounded mixed with the confused shouts of officers. I see bullets piercing chests and heads. It is all live, horrible and shocking.Saving Private Ryan brings a new angle on War. The personal angle, that of a single human being facing the horror of death around him, of blind chance deciding whether he'll get wounded or killed or just scratched. Spielberg managed to do what no director have done before - bring you inside a battlezone and let you feel the chaos from within. You suddenly find yourself crouched in your chair, not knowing when the next blow will come from. Shaking with every bone of your body when a tank approaches. Ducking when bullets come near.The film could have been a masterpiece, if the plot was more sharp, if the characters were less flat and if the 'dirty dozen' ending was avoided. But still, it's a must to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something to be said for fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of the best fictionalized accounts of war I have ever seen. The first twenty minutes (which will most likely be cut when the film makes its television premiere) are more than just war itself -- they are real. The real face of war, pain, death, and loss.I loved this movie for the cohesiveness (seldom found in other war movies), but there was a major problem with it -- the claim that it was true. A little research into the situation soon shows that Spielberg took more than a LITTLE dramatic license -- the last two hours never happened. There was no major "rescue mission". Poor Pvt. Ryan wandered home one day, and they said, "Oh, hey, we were looking for you!"As a movie educating people about the horrors of war, though, this is an excellent choice, provided the audience knows it's fiction. It's right up there with "Courage Under Fire" (also starring Matt Damon) as an excellent fiction resource. People wishing to check out a more realistic account of war will want to view "Thin Red Line" and the Canadian mini-series "The Valour and the Horror", both of which are more or less "true" accounts of wartime events.Although an excellent movie, there is an inherent problem with using big name actors like Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore. Not only are they far too old for the roles (it was highly unusual to find a WWII soldier over 25 -- most were between 18 and 21 -- and almost every soldier in this movie is late thirties or older), but viewers come in with an already formed opinion. "Tom Hanks? Oh, yes, he's the comedian who often plays an uptight neurotic who's likely to have a nervous breakdown." "Tom Sizemore? Cynical guy with a fairly crude sense of humor and an eye for the ladies." "Adam Goldberg? Ah! Chandler's freaky and psychopathic roommate on "Friends"!" Edward Burns, Canadian actor Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, and to a certain extent Goldberg were far better for their roles than big time actors Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, Damon, Sizemore, and Hanks. It's not lack of ability, but rather lack of SUITability.The movie deserves a high rating, but mis-representation (saying the movie was historically based when it was in fact fictional) and glamorizing (casting big name actors to draw viewers) detracted from the movie in some ways. It's got an 8.5 from me, and two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg is back, but - there's something missing! In his new movie, "Saving Private Ryan", Spielberg once again showed that he is one of the best directors in the world. But the problem with this movie is in the script. The beginning and the end of the movie, i.e. parts that take place in present time, are redundant and belong in soap opera, not in movie. In the scenes on Omaha beach solders die violently and realistically, but as the movie develops it becomes more "Hollywood" movie, and less an intensive and (relatively) realistic story about war. The most disappointing moment is the one in which captain Miller dies. Why should he give his little speech instead dying like all the others? Is he "better" than the others are? And even if he is better (I don't think that he is) - so what??? In my opinion the whole movie aims to justify war and tries to do so by proving that: a) people get killed so that other can live, and b), war was horrible, but it made this beautiful presence possible. And I don't like it when others impose their opinion on me - I prefer to make my own conclusions.</fullReview>

This movie DID entertain me and was shocking. But as an actual movie it does fall down.For a start, nothing actually happens plot-wise. The confrontation between Hanks and Private Ryan when they finally meet is pure Hollywood rubbish. This movies tries to be realistic but the illusion goes at parts like that. On the same subject, people get mown down left, right and centre...yet our core heroes have bullets bouncing around their feet and seem immune.However these flaws are no less than you'd find in any other movie so I think it is a victim of its own success. Because the action and gore is so realistic and gripping you expect too much from the rest of the movie.One other thing in its favour was that it wasn't *too* over-the-top with American schmaltz...however it was there a tad.God bless America!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this film which hasn't already been said. The acting, the setting, the cinematography simply captures your mind, heart, and soul and brings you (sometimes dragging you unwillingly) on this journey into one of the darkest yet most vital and necessary moments in our history as a nation. I think this movie provided many with an insight into the reality of war on a level which has not been previously captured. There are scenes in this movie which once seen cannot be "unseen". Images which will last in your mind for a very long time and make you appreciate the sacrifice of so many not so long ago. We praise Firemen for their courage to stand ready to enter a burning building to save a life. How should we praise the men and women in uniform who likewise stand ready to enter combat, at a moments notice, to preserve our way of life. Yet the latter group tends to be praised or spurned with the changing of the political tides. Every now and then a movie comes along which can do something to correct such an injustice in our mindsets. This was one such movie. It should become part of high school or college history curriculums for either the study of the history of war (though this was not based on a true story) or as a study in human character and psychology, much as Moby Dick is a study of human obsession with a task which must be accomplished. I give this the highest rating of 10 for the superb acting, the script, and the courage to show us the realistic effects of war on people.</fullReview>

Upon reading some of these comments, I have a few of my own.To those who thought the film was not perfect, but overall pretty darn good - I agree.To those who thought the film was lousy - p*** off.To those who thought the film didn't have good character development - get a life.To those who thought the film didn't have a good plot - what film school did you say you went to?To those who thought the film was not anti-war enough - hello, the sixties are over, then go back and see the film again.To those who thought the film didn't answer the meaning of life - read the bible or do yoga, then lighten up, it's just a movie.To those who thought the film was too violent - war is undoubtedly worse than this film or any other could ever portray.To those who thought the film was too "mushy" - ask any veteran about his lost friends, (bring a tissue).To those who thought the film should have shown soliers from the other nations involved in D-Day - it's an AMERICAN film about AMERICAN soldiers in the AMERICAN invasion sector on an AMERICAN landing beach looking for an AMERICAN paratrooper in an AMERICAN drop zone, enough said.To those who thought the film was too Pro American - spend the next 70 years and billions of dollars in the country of your choice building your own film industry and then make your own film about D-Day.To those who thought the film was too "Hollywood" - see my comment above.To those who just want to take a poke at Spielberg - what have you done lately?Finally, the right to freely express ourselves as we have all just done was paid for in blood.

		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm impressed at how many Australians have commented here on what is clearly a very American movie in attitude and content. Secondly, anyone who says this is easily the best movie they've ever watched needs to watch more movies. That said, this is an exceptionally well made film and definitely worth seeing. The criticisms I have with the movie don't nearly outweigh its finer qualities. Too many criicisms focus on what a movie isn't (and should be?) rather than what it is. This movie attempts to provide some insight into the horrors of war, without straying too far from the standard war-fare (cute pun). I also felt a touch of the Cameron-esque (chiefly in the unnecessary use of the flash-back but other things too). The 'hooray for America' line that is so common is trundled out again, the only reference to the rest of the Allies is criticism. I was impressed 'though that Spielberg didn't try to suggest that American soldiers were flawless saviours. The execution of prisoners was an important part of this. The comments of others seem to suggest some tenuous holds on reality. The camera work in the battle scenes could be jerky, but I thought it was effective and didn't last too long. The bloodshed was unpleasant and realistic, but not real. If this movie made people a little more educated about how horrific war really is, how chaotic and terrifying, all the better. I am not sure 'though that some glory did not attach itself to Miller's team and their deaths. Lastly, I was impressed that, although this was a long movie, it didn't feel it at all. It held my attention the whole time. Anyway, enough already. Very good movie, 8/10 (9 being my highest - no such thing as a 10 in art). Definitely worth the price of a ticket, even in the home of costly movie tickets.</fullReview>

The movie has a plot and the effect, sound, etc really grasp the audience. Moreover, what the film really delivers is that no one really wins in a war, but it is important that young people know about the past.Yet it was an allied campaign and forces from the British empire and Australia were totally involved. It would have been nice if the Australians got a mention somewhere in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie. Beautiful pictures, good acting and good sound. The only thing that disappointed me was the typical American script. The story about bringing back private Ryan was so typical for Hollywood. But the rest of the film was so intense that you almost forgot this annoyance.Saving Private Ryan is a film I will recommend to everyone with a strong stomach who wants to see a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure that I could dribble on for hours on how fantastic I thought this movie was!Saving Private Ryan is a powerful and moving account of a World War II mission to save Private Ryan whose three brothers were killed in action.I think that the most powerful part of this movie was the fact that the huge loss of life that the viewers were confronted with actually did occur. For so many years, the world was bogged down in war and mothers, wives, sisters, daughters and the like lost some of the men that meant the most to them.Saving Private Ryan is one of those movies you have got to see. To miss this flick is a tragedy. Perhaps if we are reminded of how horrific war is, the world will think twice about having another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual and technical masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an amazing piece of film. The first thirty minutes are at the height of cinema anywhere - sound design is awesome. However, the film continues from such a prodigious sequence and actually improves as we get to know the finely constructed characters. The film is a visual masterpiece, more than complimenting any of the dialogue. No one can tell a story through images like Spielberg can, and that's why people call him "simplistic." However, only high minded critics that want a greater 'text' would say this - In reality, the great text comes through the images, which is what film is really about.The battle sequences are constructed with greatness. The editing is outstanding, especially the sound editing, which is amazing (the fear/security contrast that Spielberg always uses is demonstrated between the sound of the bullets in combat, and the ticking of the typewriters. Another bullet like sound used effectively is the rain drops). This is undoubtedly a great film. It is in my mind, highly anti-war, and the first thirty minutes are perhaps the most eloquent statement of that - for no other film maker has really captured an anti-war message by expressing the sheer chaos of an event that saw thousands sacrificed before they even got out of the landing craft. This film will raise many issues and ignite much debate - the film may look deceptively simple, but behind it lie many issues that run very deep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...in a way that only Spielberg could. Really, if the man wants to be realistic, you can expect reality. Nothing in recent memory can surpass the impact of that beach landing carnage. It's the hideous, laughing face of War personified, and seeing that is the most disturbing aspect of this film.Unfortunately, I have to agree that the work as a whole seemed flawed. To put it bluntly, it's a story reminiscent of an episode of Combat (now that someone brought it up), plus some movie-scale battle scenes. All bound by that flashback structure. It all held together all right, but just a tad less satisfactorily. It's painfully (yet distantly) similar to what Titanic suffered from.Nonetheless high production values, all-round good performances, and an undeniable capacity to put you "right there" in the middle of the action (the apprehension was almost unbearable during the early moments of the final battle) far outweigh the gripes. Heck I still ended up giving it an 8/10. That's a "Go watch it!" rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a 15-year old boy, living in Brisbane, Australia. I have had no experience with war, and I don't often watch war movies. I'd heard reviews and so I was anticipating a good flick, and the fact that the first day of its season coincided with my end of exams, we thought we'd celebrate with a movie. We picked the wrong one. Let me just say, this is a phenomenal movie, but not one to celebrate with. Myself and three of my friends were completely wiped out by the impact of this movie. I've only seen it once, and I haven't yet had the courage to see it again. I felt almost sick during the movie - it totally wrenched all life out of me. I was exhausted by the end, completely obliterated. I never thought anything could have an impact on me like this. I will see it again, and perhaps I will be able to appreciate the detail and finer points of the movie. I will now devote my life to never taking part in war. Afterwards, I could not understand how anyone could possibly go to war as an infantryman and expect or hope to survive. The honesty of the film allowed me to realise how awful war is. Images are permanently burnt into your brain, leaving you to contemplate by yourself. See this movie now, if you haven't already, but, as I said earlier, BY NO MEANS expect this movie to be light and entertaining. Please e-mail me if you feel the same way after seeing this movie.

		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece! After Schindler's List, Mr. Spielberg may have created the next BIG Oscar winner.I would venture to add that if SPR fails to win more Oscars than that pathetic excuse for a multiple Oscar winner Titanic, then I say the members of the Academy board should all just resign.First, the bad things: Although Mr. Spielberg showed both sides of the story and the atrocities committed by each, you can't help but notice the obvious American bias this movie has. That flying American flag before the closing credits sure proclaimed to the world that America is King!I also can't help but point out the flawed way by which the film relied on the flashback vehicle. The movie was seen through the eyes of one of those involved, but the thing is, he never had first hand knowledge of some of the events that transpired. It could have been better if two men met in the cemetery and recalled the events.Although Tom Hanks' acting once again shows through, the movie did not quite fully utilize his wonderful gift. Ditto for Matt Damon's character. Tom Sizemore's was actually better.In any event, the portrayal of the horrors which occurred during such a sad and terrible event effectively makes Mr. Spielberg's film a classic. It not only is a poignant and honest film, but is also a voice for "documentary-type" films. The cinematography was fantastic and the pacing dramatic. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to do so. If you have, then go back and see it again. I know I will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less to it than meets the eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has, without doubt, an extraordinary talent to put together images and visual structure in a film. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of his ability to develop character or present the complexities of human chaos. SPR attacks the senses with a stunning opening sequence that conveys the noise and confusion of battle, but as soon as the film has to concentrate on the characters, and their motivations, it sinks into a grossly jingoistic and sentimentalised version of history in which every company in the American Army is made up of a representative of each personality type, America saves the free world (three cheers from the ever grateful British, French, Dutch etc etc and where were the civilians in all of this) and the enemy (the Germans) are barely one-dimensional caricatures of monsters and bufoons (they are so much the Other that the battle tanks resemble flying saucers from a 1950s Sci-fi cartoon) .Remember that a good old GI sock can beat the might of German demonic technology. We even have the Cavalry (in this case, the airstrike) coming to the rescue in the final reel.Have we grown up at all ? It would appear not. Maybe Spielberg just can't help himself, but to regard this as anything more than a hopelessly naive, patronising and ill-considered attempt to present "War as the true Measure of a Man" (not women you may note) is to be blind to the world outside Norman Rockwell, Apple Pie and the Great American Dream.What is most distressing is that Spielberg has the eye and ear of (perhaps) millions of people, and they may come away believing that this is history (because of the apparent verisimilitude of the battle scenes in particular).This fundamentally flawed film flatters to deceive. There is less to it than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see movie, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt a must-see movie because of the message it conveys in the first 30 minutes or so. I found myself curling up in my seat, cringeing, and hoping not to see any more disturbing scenes, while still glad that I was merely watching a movie. That's how mind-blowing it was. But I seriously felt that the rest of the movie wasn't all that great- it was simply an above average war movie, and the remaining 2.5 hours or so was nowhere near comparable to the first half-hour of the film. There was nothing extraordinarily brilliant, with the exception of a few of the final battle scenes. When I watch a movie, for me, the most important thing is enjoyment. And this movie, while being extremely compelling and thought provoking, was hardly enjoyable (anyone who has seen it would know why). Nevertheless, I had absolutely no idea how the war sequences were choreographed to be so realistic. It really makes you feel that you are in the war itself. But towards the end, Spielberg just couldn't resist to put in his trademark sentimentality into the movie. And for me, that kind of ruined it, because it was undoing all the brilliance of the first 30 minutes. Making it so blatantly obvious that he was trying to make it sentimental and dramatically heroic was in fact glorifying the war, which was the exact opposite of what Spielberg was trying to convey throughout the entire movie. And the nonsense of the final scene made me feel like I was watching another movie written by James Cameron. Despite all the criticisms, I still feel this movie is worthy of the recognition it has been getting. Its brilliance is difficult to deny, and personally, I'll give it 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAVING RYAN'S PRIVATES....now THAT would have been a good movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is a good first step towards making more realistic war movies, but it hasn't quite reached there yet. I felt that wimpy translator guy would have been a better old man than Ryan at the end. Besides, he was there for more than 1/3 of the time, unlike Ryan. There are a few areas of improvement. Firstly, they need to cut out all that sentimental and bonding crap, and find other ways of developing characters rather than just a few silly laughs while retelling old times... Secondly, acknowledge that the enemy (in this case, the Germans), were at least partially human, and experienced some of the same emotions those heroic Americans experienced. (F*** Hitler? Man, I would like to hear some of the Americans say that about their leaders). Thirdly, link those excellent battle sequences with the plot of the movie. Oh...and most importantly, don't glorify the war by making all the dead characters look like such big heroes. I thought this movie was supposed to be anti-war. And I can't believe how Ryan was so emotional at the end. He had only met Miller and Co. a few hours before the big battle, and he barely knew Miller or what they went through to save him, except that two of their men died (and I believe that people dying was rather common during that time). Oh, but I guess it was still pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couldn't be bothered to read all the comments, but it seems like everything's been said. But I would like to add that whilst SPR is a damn good movie, and that the actual depiction of war reaches a new level of realism (and this is mainly WHY it is such a landmark movie), various parts of it have been ripped off (for want of a better expression) other, better movies.The 'shellshocked perspectives' (where everything goes silent during the intense battle-scenes) appear to have been lifted from Kurosawa's (far superior) "RAN", particularly the much talked about 'man-picks-up-severed-arm' shot.The inexperienced non-infantry soldier attached to the squad idea was put to far better use by Wolfgang Peterson in "DAS BOOT", and the basic plot outline doesn't really deviate from the standard WW2 action movies that the film critiques.In the Mr Showbiz interview, Spielberg said he was trying not to use the war as a "springboard to false adventure", but he has instead used the war as a springboard to re-examine the 'adventure' of war. The war itself is marginalised, the experience of war is the subject, and is examined simply through the harrowing recreation of it.Mr Showbiz also compared the film's opening scene to that of "The Wild Bunch", and it does have the same power. The difference is that the latter film would maintain a certain greatness MINUS the violence, whereas SPR rides on the power of its opening scene.As pure technique, Saving Private Ryan is genius, and ranks among the most noble achievements of cinema in recent memory. But as an original work of true greatness, it is something less. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

On the way home it took me a while to notice that I was driving well below the speed limit. My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter than they had ever before. When we got home, we stood outside my house for two hours, simply talking about the movie, about war, about what it MEANS to be human. Any movie that can do all that and then some, has got to be the greatest of all time. On this scale, a 10. On my scale, 9.8. (9.8 is the highest rating I have ever given a movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not on the stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg once said: "If it's not on the page, it's not on the stage." He seems to be out to prove this in his last few films. And this from the man who made more than one of the best films of all time. Here it is: The first twenty minutes, though the most gripping, are completely redundant. It does nothing for the story, which has a good premise, but fails to deliver. Are we suppose to care for any of these people, that we know nothing about? And the main character (Tom Hanks) would like it to stay that way. Because we don't know the characters, we feel less the terror of the war. We see it (very realistically and well done), but we don't FEEL it. And then they have to remind us that everything is strange, Tom Hanks saying that he feels it's a surreal situation. Don't tell us, show us! Then there is Spielberg's sentimentality pushed to the limit and over. "Am I a good man? Tell me I've been a good man." Enough is enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that the criticisms I have read concerning this movie just don't ring true, but some of the praise seems equally wrong.The movie seemingly uses a 'retrospective' method of framing the main action... which turns out to be not quite what it seems (to say more would give too much away). Some have called this cheesy, but I doubt that anyone would be saying that if 'Titanic' hadn't beaten SPR to it. It's effective, and sets you up for a plot twist at the end (If you still don't get it, that's too bad). The characters are fleshed out stereotypes because they are *representative* characters, and in a plot that's largely a cog in the whole symbolism of the thing. The battle of Omaha beach is not relevant for the plot, but this is a movie which steps outside its plot. It's a morality tale, not about soldiers, but about the modern world where some people are safe because others have died (horribly) bringing that about. This is what the seemingly confusing flashback is about, this is what the battle scenes are about and the whole point of the screenplay seems to be to get us to ask ourselves the question that the old man asks at the end of the movie. It's a shame that nit-picking amateur film critics fail to see the big picture.As for the whole goriness thing... that's the way it is. Gory. You are supposed to be horrified, not entertained (someone described the landing sequence as 'exciting'. I don't know what's more frightening, the sequence or that response). And finally we have a film that pulls no punches and has so much moral ambiguity that we can identify with the characters, loathe them, and find no fault in them all at the same time. I would say 'brilliant', except that it's a function of the sheer horrific nature of the circumstances they find themselves in and not something you feel like applauding.All in all, this is a movie that should, at the very least, change the way that the viewer thinks about action movies. Spielberg has done here for the War and Action genres what Eastwood did to the Western with 'Unforgiven': that is to say, completely debunked all the old Hollywood mythos and glorification. With all the tricks in the book Spielberg and co have created a nightmare image all from the perspective of its victims. I've never seen anything like it. Spielberg's battlefield is like the industrial revolution gone horribly wrong: a huge machine of percussive clashes, explosions and fire spitting out buzzing fragments of metal tearing chunks out of masonry, landscape and people. Hell in a can. Anyone who doesn't walk out of this movie in a state of numb denial muttering "never again" is already lost.See it.</fullReview>

Yeah, let's show a child the horrors of war in a brutally realistic fashion and then tell everyone here what a freakin' idiot they are to drag an eight year old to this movie. I'm a parent and there are films which obviously are ones they should not, under any circumstances be exposed to. #1--they have nightmares #2 --they are very very much bothered by many of the scenes and are told --don't worry it's only a movie--although it's a pretty damn accurate one about a real event with fictional characters #3--they are numb to depictions of violence, filmed, or real. They might not differentiate too much between film or real life and therefore might have a tendency to act in a violent way or be attracted to violence and shock... in order to FEEL something... because they are numb most of the time....You get the idea.Okay the film has some flaws. The framing device doesn't work particularly well and feels .. well like an attempt to do what Speilberg in Schindler's List. If the movie is a character's memory, then why are some scenes not possibly the memory of the character?Not a serious flaw but a really unnecessary device to use inthe film.The characters are not particularly well-drawn, and what little back story they do have (with the exception of Hanks) is very cliche'd stuff.These things don't matter much however over-all. It depicts in a gruesomely realistic and emotional way what war is about. And that's a feat that has rarely been accomplished.This is a powerful anti-war film for the coming millennium, much as All Quiet on the Western Front was in the 1930's.There is a minimal amount of pathos and sentimentality in the film, and what there is, although cliche'd, works to some degree.There are some wonderful moments. The man who picks up his own arm (or is it leg) on the field of battle. The young man who is amazed his helmet has saved his life. He takes off his helmet looks at the dent where the bullet was and then.... that's right... he gets shot in the head and dies.The nervous breakdown Hanks house in the battle.The inability of the interpreter character to be a hero and save someone's life....during the final battle scene. More affecting perhaps because some of the film does resort to cliche's. But not here. When you really want it to. When you hope it will. It doesn't, making the scene more powerful.Bravo.Please stop letting your kids see violence in movies. Sex and language is one matter and isn't going to hurt them. Violence particularly realistic violence (not slapstick or cartoon) is having an effect on young children. DON'T BRING THEM TO VIOLENT FILMS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. One word that sums up the whole film. I was totally blown away with it. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job with 'Saving Private Ryan', furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in Tom Hanks' career. For those of you who manage to sit through the first twenty-five minutes of carnage, you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call, 'the greatest war movie of all time'. I was in awe of the feat Steven Spielberg has accomplished. Some may place it alongside 'Schindler's List' as his greatest achievement. Me, I rate it higher.Seeing the film in a cinema, with surround sound, places the audience in the middle of the D-Day Invasion. Gruesome as it may be, the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history. With strong back-up performances from the relatively young supporting cast, 'Saving Private Ryan' will no doubt go into the 1999 Academy Awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories, including best actor (Hanks), best director (Spielberg), and best picture.It has opened the door to reality. The public can finally see what war was really like. Frightening. Some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie. But finally we have a realistic war film. 'Rambo', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter'. None of the myths of war these films have created. 'Platoon' is the only realistic war film in recent memory. Yes, they are all Vietnam movies. But give me an example of a decent World War II movie. Alongside, or even above, 'Das Boot', 'Saving Private Ryan' is a classic World War II film. A modern classic. No more, no less. Congratulations to Steven Spielberg on such a fine effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, I was gobsmacked within five minutes of this fast and frighteningly realistic war movie. During the first battlescene on the beach my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was nearly sick in my popcorn, the portrayal of the landings was so accurate I could cry. I have great knowledge of the D-Day landings having read books, been to France and strolled around the museums for the 50 year anniversary and watched many films and thus I can say with all sincerity that this is the most realsitic yet. Other films such as 'The Longest Day' do not really show the full horror of D-Day whereas in SPR I felt as if I was their experiencing the soldiers fear and anguish, it was fantastic. As for the claims that 'without the two battlescenes it wouldn't be any good' they are rubbish, their is still plenty of tense and exciting moments in between to keep me happy, anyway if it just consisted of battlescenes all the way through my heart would have packed up. Also in this months Total Film two people have written in letters that suggest that SPR has no substance and character development. I do not agree with these statements as you really have to look into the film and what it's about to get something out of it. I could tell you something about all of the eight men as the characters were developed in such a way that was probably realistic for the period. You have to realise that this is a war film not some movie about a man trapped in a TV show (Truman Show), so character development is not as important in this case although it is still crucial for a good film. Also the cinematography is excellent. Mr Spielberg used a slightly slower film than normal during the battlescenes to give the feeling of speed and this is why I spent the first 30 minutes with my heart in overdrive, the direction from Mr Spielberg was as ever excellent. He attempted something new in the portrayal of injuries and deaths (guy picking arm up off the beach, German sniper, knife in chest close up) and I was overjoyed yet disturbed. For too long film directors have side stepped the brutal reality of war. I also liked the way war is not glorified as invariably happens in a war film. In all a great movie which had the right blend of ingredients for a war movie and it has now replaced Platoon (Oliver Stone) as my favourite war movie. It is a particuarly exciting but moving film and I will look upon war in a different light from this day forth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now who was that movie about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably the singularly most effective, deterring war movie ever, but who was it really about? I didn't see a real main character throughout the movie. Tom Hanks's character does not have much to do except bark orders and be the remote leader, and Pvt. Ryan himself we only get to know after two thirds of the film. The only interesting character was the interpreter guy, but he was treated like a minor character. In the end, this means that this movie was about World War 2, which was terrible. Well, I had figured that out before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>light entertainment with a veneer of sincerity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can deny American movie makers, and Spielberg is a king, can produce the best technical effects in movies. This movie also has some wonderfully personable stars. (Tom Hanks is great, and I liked the sergeant, too.) And the human scenes are tastefully understated - no brash posturing here. This is Hollywood art. But under the beautiful technical veneer, is there anything more here than an incoherent collection of cliches?Is consistent thought or feeling or fundamental honesty too much to ask? What is the point of making another movie about World War II after all this time? What does this movie say that so many others have missed, if anything? War is a serious subject - "serious" is a drastic understatement, if you happen to be in one - one that a new generation knows nothing about. And it doesn't look as if the world has made any progress in avoiding them, since the one depicted here.I think it's dishonest to play the patriotic sentimentality card with such intensity while claiming credit for condemning war. To show blood and guts is not necessarily to say that war is wrong - only that it is unpleasant, or possibly, exciting. Is shooting prisoners really wrong? Or only what you gotta do, and the mark of a real man? Is war really senseless? Or is it a patriotic duty, well worth giving your life for?I have never been in a war, but I promise you war is a lot worse than what you will see here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is below average. It is typical Spielberg; some of the pictures are very touching and beautiful, and the story is told in a way that really "gets to you". However it is very "American" (no offense to all the Americans). It is about believing that even in the darkest places there is good in man. This is sickenly symbolised by the patriotism of the brave American soldiers who are willing to give their lives for free world. The opening scene, and the very last shot too, is the American star spangled banner blowing in the wind (Yuck). So believe me the story has been told before and Tom Hanks dos not make it any more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why a lot of moviegoers keep saying that the plot of "Saving Private Ryan" is too thin. Any person who has seen a number of great films will realize that the plot doesn't really matter that much (I'm paraphrasing Hitchcock!!) It's the feeling you get from watching it and the characters that you can relate to. It's upsetting to see how ignorant some people can be, especially when there is so many great emotional moments in this film. And this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it was made for the soldiers, not heroes, of wwii.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Speilberg has once again amazed audiences world wide. His newest movie, Saving Private Ryan is the most realistic war movie ever made. Stunning performances from all cast members especially Tom Hanks, who should win the academy award, Tom Sizemore and newcomer Barry Pepper. The realistic first twenty minutes and the last battle are incomparable to any movie ever made. This movie is not anti-German, but anti-war, a first in a long time. This movie does not glorify death, but shows it as it is, especially in war, horrible. This is an amazing movie that should be shown to all children to show them that death is not glamorous, contrary to most movies, news, and TV shows, show it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No war film can be 'too realistic'....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. One word that sums up the whole film. I was totally blown away with it. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job with 'Saving Private Ryan', furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in Tom Hanks' career. For those of you who manage to sit through the first twenty-five minutes of carnage, you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call, 'the greatest war movie of all time'. I was in awe of the feat Steven Spielberg has accomplished. Some may place it alongside 'Schindler's List' as his greatest achievement. Me, I rate it higher.Seeing the film in a cinema, with surround sound, places the audience in the middle of the D-Day Invasion. Gruesome as it may be, the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history. With strong back-up performances from the relatively young supporting cast, 'Saving Private Ryan' will no doubt go into the 1999 Academy Awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories, including best actor (Hanks), best director (Spielberg), and best picture.It has opened the door to reality. The public can finally see what war was really like. Frightening. Some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie. But finally we have a realistic war film. 'Rambo', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter'. None of the myths of war these films have created. 'Platoon' is the only realistic war film in recent memory. Yes, they are all Vietnam movies. But give me an example of a decent World War II movie. Alongside, or even above, 'Das Boot', 'Saving Private Ryan' is a classic World War II film. A modern classic. No more, no less. Congratulations to Steven Spielberg on such a fine effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie that I wish never had to exist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone expects a movie to capture the real feelings, events, and horror of what WWII soldiers felt during the war, then they had better re-evaluate their own reality. It is true, no movie can ever give true credit to the real feelings of WWII soldiers, but Saving Private Ryan seems to come close.I have never been close to being in a war or even in the military, but Saving Private Ryan has given me new respect not only of WWII, but of all our armed forces today. In these days, it seems freedom in America is something that almost has naturally always existed. Most children and teens don't realize the sacrifice that has been made to bring about that freedom. Steven Spielberg, has crafted a movie to bring that lost reality of war to us who do not fully understand the terror of it. The details in this movie especially in the opening battle scene, allowed me some idea, although can never do justice, of what my grandfathers had to endure. I was truly impacted in more ways than I had expected before viewing the movie. This movie has succeeded in making people think seriously about life and death and what it all means. I think we need more of that in America. I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time, but I hate the fact that it ever had to exist in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it worth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an amateur historian, SPR confirmed a lesson I had already learned: next time the USA gets into a war -- WIN IT! And don't let up or pull punches until the enemy is beaten and *knows* he's beaten. FDR was the last US president who could make up his mind to win a war. Truman split the difference in Korea -- granted, a good move in an uncertain world. LBJ sent millions into a war he had absolutely no intention of winning or even settling for a Korea-style armistice. Bush, with his hazy, myopic talk about some "New World Order" and "the vision thing", is now unemployed while Saddam Hussein still butchers Iraqi civilians and blames the UN (read: US) for it. And Clinton -- great at negotiating a peace, for those who want peace. But for those who don't...?I refer, of course, to the scene dripping with face-to-face hate where the German SS trooper (betcha didn't notice he was) whom they let go on a promise to turn himself in ("be-e-e-e good!") shoots and knifes some of them while the last one sits in a soiled diaper of his own fear and self-pity. Minerva was the Greco-Roman Goddess of Wisdom; she was also the Gs. of Just Wars. But this was the image of Mars: the God of Combat in War. Even von Clausewitz refers to the Hate in combat.(Pause. Deep breath.)That much said, I have to agree with just about every comment on SPR. The story is weak. The bits with the flags and the strings are maudlin, to say the least. And all the other stuff about plot development/character development. Yes, Spielberg himself admitted it took the disillusionment of the Vietnam War to make this movie, yet he still blatantly tugs at your heartstrings -- he's been doing that since ET; I've long since learned to ignore his saccharine ploys. And yes, this is one of the best movies ever made, even if there were better war or antiwar pics made. Only the battle scenes really make this movie -- it should get the Oscar for Cinematography.But the thing I got from SPR throughout was from the characters griping about why they should risk their necks for one man. The general theme of the movie appears, to me at any rate, to be "this $%^&amp; better be worth it!" -- the universal gripe from the universal soldier. Now, you tell me, is any of this $%^&amp; worth your neck or mine if your side has absolutely no intent of winning or even getting something out of all this? The US military morale went down the toilet after 1968 and spent the '70s in a drug-induced haze. It took Reagan's 1980s build-up to rebuild morale; without it the Gulf War would never have been so one-sided.No, I'm no soldier, nor some fascist war-freak in a rathole filled with white-trash-militia collectables. I've watched the horrors of war comfortably on my TV or my PC, just like many of us surfing this site. I'm as revulsed as anyone else at the pictures and the news-stories. I get an impotent rage demanding "do something, Powers-That-Be!", knowing full well they have no idea what to do, given the limits they set on themselves. I'm as pro-peace as they come. But I'm also pro-good-sense -- not just "common-sense." There was a difference between Chamberlain and Churchill. One saw hell coming and tried to buy it off; the other saw it coming and said, "get ready!" And this, certainly, was a disciple of Minerva.(Pause again. Another deep breath.)I'd say more but the guys with the butterfly nets have traced me. Just let me sign off by saying that if we want a world at peace then we best make our minds up to make that peace and *enforce* it! Nobody did in the 1930s; that's why there was a *Second* World War.One other thing -- I wonder how will SPR play on home-video? Will it be as horrifying?</fullReview>

I have never been that interested in War movies before, with the exception of most Vietnam movies but this really has changed my prospective on them. I will look at most War movies made and compare them to this, though I doubt they will ever come close. The battle scenes in this movie were unbelievable. They were so realistic. It made you feel like you were experiencing some of what these soldiers had to go through, especially the opening scene. I have an uncle who has been interested in World War II for as long as I can remember. He was so fascinated by this war that he had tousands of pounds worth of memorabilia of it including medals, guns, knives and uniforms. He is also a great critic of movies, rarely saying that any movie was good, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear him say that he thought that this was the best war movie ever made and that it contained scenes that could never be topped. It was brilliantly acted bringing what should be at least two Oscar nominations for acting roles. Elsewhere I am hoping it will clean up at the Oscars, deserving them more than a lot of recent Oscar winning films have done. It will take some doing to better this film. I only wonder what Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is going to compare.</fullReview>

I loved the first half hour and the last half hour, but the remaining two hours was a drawn out generic film with poor character development and a throw-away plot. The only character who evoked any emotion was Jeremy Davies' overly sympathetic translator. All the rest were a bunch of bad Hollywood stereotypes (the guy from Brooklyn, the hardass, the mysterious commander... etc.). and the acting made the movie even worse. I love Ed Burns as a director but think he is awful as an actor (especially after viewing this film), and Tom Hanks assumed his standard heroic role doing little to draw all of the Oscar attention that has come his way. The two portions that made this movie worthwhile were the two battle scenes in which Spielberg masterfully placed us in this horrifying world. but I would have been just as satisfied if the movie consisted of just these two parts leaving out all the excess garbage. And with that you can proceed to hunt me down and have me tarred and feathered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply the best movie I've ever seen. It does not promote war nor is it an anti-war movie. This is a movie about duty. Everyone must do their duty, even if that duty leads to death, if we are to enjoy the freedom that we have. My friends and I could put ourselves into the movie very easily, as we are the age of the average American soldier in WW2. When the car crawls down Mrs. Ryan's driveway we could all see that car coming to our house. We all wondered how we would react in the situation (God willing we won't ever have to do anything like this) and how we would handle seeing our friends die in front of us. For young men like us, this is an especially potent movie. A week has passed and this movie still makes us think about all the messages the movie conveys. This film makes no excuses and presents a refreshingly gritty, realistic version of war that lacks a lot of the usual Hollywood slickness and cliches. The next day in ROTC we discussed this movie with our NSI, Maj. Aguilar and still could not get over "Saving Private Rayn" . Kudos to Mr. Spielberg and Company, I hope you get the Oscar you deserve for this because God knows they cheated you out of a couple before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Differing Points of View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments posted within the IMDb, and I am not surprised to see a line drawn in the sand. Many of my American compatriots have declared this movie to be amazing, moving, and eye-opening. On the other side of the pond, we get comments like, "I hated it. This is nowhere near to be called 'The Greatest War Movie Ever Made'" This all depends on where you grew up. In the United States, during the Time of War, WWII did not happen to us. We went to fight an injustice on another shore, in another world from where we were. Our fathers, brothers and sons were dying for something that indirectly affected us. So, in order to make it palpable for American viewpoints, the Hollywood machines glossed over it, glamourized it, and made it bland. For years we were fed this malarkey about the glory of war, how "Our Boys went over and blah blah blah". This the first "true" representation of what our men did in this most unholy of campaigns. It pulls no punches, all the shades are pulled up, the veil is lifted. We, in this idyllic bubble had no earthly idea. We did not see first-hand the aftermath, the tears, the rebuilding. That all happened "Over There". According to our myths, we went in, kicked butt, left, and became a world power. That's it. No one ever talked about it, except while waving an American Flag. To one of the many who believed the half-truth, it was not just a sock in the jaw, but a punch in the stomach as well, the kind that knocks the wind out of you. For what it's worth, this has been a long time coming. We saw the inhumanness of it all. Some of my European brothers have complained that this portrayed the Germans in a bad light. That maybe so, but for once the bad light has surrounded our viewpoint as well. We are not the "saviours of the world" that we thought were. This is the truth we were shielded from "for our own good" as it were. The truth hurts, and now 50 years too late, we can finally weep with you as members of the same family. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for showing us the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this is a good movie. I gave it an eight out of ten. But to all of you who have called it the greatest war-movie ever; you haven't seen enough movies. It may be the best American war-movie, but it isn't nearly as good as for example "Stalingrad", or "Das Boot". It starts out very good, the famous first twenty minutes are really very good. But then it deteriorates steadily. Especially, it is very one-sided. Some people say it's an anti-war movie, I can't agree with that. This movie shows only the allied soldiers as human, and the Germans as faceless monsters. The real horror of war is that there are ordinary scared young men on both sides. This dimension is lost completely in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starring Tom Hanks, directed by Steven Spielberg. It must be a dream!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. One word that sums up the whole film. I was totally blown away with it. Steven Spielberg did such a fantastic job with 'Saving Private Ryan', furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in Tom Hanks' career. For those of you who manage to sit through the first twenty-five minutes of carnage, you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call, 'the greatest war movie of all time'. I was in awe of the feat Steven Spielberg has accomplished. Some may place it alongside 'Schindler's List' as his greatest achievement. Me, I rate it higher.Seeing the film in a cinema, with surround sound, places the audience in the middle of the D-Day Invasion. Gruesome as it may be, the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history. With strong back-up performances from the relatively young supporting cast, 'Saving Private Ryan' will no doubt go into the 1999 Academy Awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories, including best actor (Hanks), best director (Spielberg), and best picture.It has opened the door to reality. The public can finally see what war was really like. Frightening. Some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie. But finally we have a realistic war film. 'Rambo', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter'. None of the myths of war these films have created. Yes, they are all Vietnam movies. But give me an example of a decent World War II movie. Alongside, or even above, 'Das Boot', and perhaps 'Platoon', 'Saving Private Ryan' is a classic war film. A modern classic. No more, no less. Congratulations to Steven Spielberg on such a fine effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, the one-liner actually covers it. Growing up at a time when personal sacrifice is not emphasized or encouraged among the youth of America, Saving Private Ryan gives me a new sense of what the generation of my grandparents went through so I could know the world as it is today. From the "movie" point of view, this is definitely an excellent movie. Spielberg has mastered the art, and he proves it yet again with a new style of cinematography, putting the audience in the foxhole with the soldier instead of on the outside looking in. A masterful performance is turned in by Ed Burns, but the real art comes from Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, and of course, Tom Hanks. Though Matt Damon is one of the headliners, his performance is short and solid, but lacks the great emotion that earns Oscars. The great performances in my opinion are by Jeremy Davies, who masterfully portrays an unexperienced soldier/translator in the heat of battle, and by Tom Sizemore, who portrays a hard core, experienced, loyal sergeant that hasn't been seen in the movies since John Wayne.Everyone should see this movie at least once in their lives. The acting is great, the story is great, and the realism is shocking. Its wrenching tale and realistic portrayal of war should give everyone a new appreciation for the American flag and for the independence we call freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie today and I was quite surprised about the violence shown in it. I'm not unused to that, but seeing this and knowing that it was and IS reality was a real hard trip. However, I think it's OK to show how brutal war is in the real world. Maybe it's good for all the youngsters to see that a man, who was shot, isn't dead at once and how war really works. "Saving Private Ryan" is no movie about heroes and clean fights with some blood running down the cheeks. It's reality, how it was and how it is. And it's worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the last 20-odd years Speilberg has provided us with some of the most memorable moments in the cinema. From Jaws through Close encounters, E.T. Indiana Jones and most of all Schindlers List. Now he has added another milestone, Saving Private Ryan.This film in the first half hour must come as close to showing the full brutality of war as anything ever seen before. Despite an occasional soggy middle section, in the opening sequences he fully makes up for any short comings that the film may otherwise have.With his track record now, I await the time when he makes his true masterpiece and ditches his more saccharine elements. In the meantime there is still plenty to appreciate.P.S. I liked Amistad as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film when it was first released in the US. Like many others I was shocked and sickened at what was presented on the screen during the invasion sequence. For the rest of the film I sat in a trance-like state, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. I left the theartre empty and cold. However, for the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The movie invaded every conscience moment, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something profound.The following weekend I decided to see it again. I'm glad I did because it was a totally different experience for me. Symbolism plays a huge part in "Saving Private Ryan" and most of it, along with character development, is extremely subtle. Pay close attention to the soldiers expressions and actions and you will learn more about them then by anything that they say. Sure there were slow, boring stretches in the movie. Spielberg intentions was for the viewer to "experience the war", as well as can be done in a film, from a soldiers standpoint. How many boring moments do you think a soldier had to endure keeping watch for the enemy or snaking across the countryside? Quite a few I suppose. And just how chatty do you think war was? I doubt soldiers spouted their life stories off to their fellow comrades. And talking with WW2 vets, including my grandfather, the Germans, right or wrong, were nameless, faceless enemies. I feel that these instances were portrayed fairly accurately in SPR.I feel this movie requires a second viewing. It will give you a chance to remove yourself from the violence and pay closer attention to other details. Then compare your reactions. I doubt that Spielberg's point of this movie was that "war is hell". That analogy is too simplistic, an easy synopsis to come up with when we are presented with material that actually requires some thought.</fullReview>

He makes you feel the pain they feel and makes you feel determined yourself to go and find this Ryan guy yourself. The special effects are by far some of the most advanced I have yet to see. It wakes you up to the fact that War Is Not A Game!!! If only more people would take the message that Speilberg is trying to put forward it would be a better world...If just 20 people got his message instead of this was good, that was bad. And really listened to what he is saying in his movies it would make a difference. A wonderful speilbergian masterpeice as usual with a very heartfelt, genuine, and most effectual message.

If you had relatives in World War II you will gain a new respect for what those relatives went through so that you could be there to see that movie. This is a Spielberg masterpiece and the only movie that I have ever given a 10 out of 10 rating. Don't take your sub-teen children to this movie. It is too intense and they won't understand it. The plain fact is, the older you are, the more you will appreciate it. My grown children and the children of my brothers and sister have seen it and were very much impressed. One nephew/niece are having their American flag signed by all their friends and relatives who are military or ex-military. Don't know if it happened everywhere, but the people in the theater were very quiet and subdued before the movie and the same after the movie. It was almost like any noise would have been a sign of disrespect. I was moved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some comments on the plot lacking believability, so I feel it's imperative that I inform you plot junkies that the events depicted in Saving Private Ryan are based on historical fact. The US government did, in fact, attempt to prevent the destruction of entire familial lines, and in many cases, the only way to retrieve those personnel was to send out small units to track them down. The fact that some find the events depicted in Saving Private Ryan incredulous merely reinforces the superb nature of the structure and content in this film.This was hands-down the best war movie I've ever seen. I wept buckets at the end--afterwards finding myself walking around my beautiful city, comparing it to the ravaged French landscapes presented in Spielberg's masterpiece. How fortunate my generation is to have been spared such a calamitous sacrifice, and how trivial all of our concerns are, when contrasted with the tribulations faced by all those who witnessed or served in the wars of generations past.</fullReview>

You instantly feel what the outcome will be of ever dilemma that is faced during the travel.

Although the film is a little bit too cruel and fleshly, but it is a good media to let people think about the reality of a war, a campaign that can ruin millions of lives and souls. The most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed, but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet. Think of it, they are flesh and blood, not the characters in the TV games. Should they be killed just for one or two people's foolish decision? They all have families, they are innocent. I appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal, to save private Ryan and send him home at any cost, he didn't mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fields.Steven Spielberg has produced a very great movie, different from the other scientific films he had ever made, but it is a most touching film that give a good lesson to most of the people. It makes me think about the song "Where have all the flowers gone?"

But, at the same time, it is triumphant, inspiring, and hopeful. The audience finally has the opportunity to see war as it is...Hell. Saving Private Ryan is (and forever shall be) a timeless war movie to symolize ALL wars. Nothing more can be said in words when the movie so vividly speaks - even screams - in a film that challenges Schindler's List as one of the greatest visual stories of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's great and what's not so great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making such inexcusable trash as "The Lost World", Spielberg just can't be taken seriously (neither can Tom Hanks, after "Forrest Gump"), no matter how hard he tries. And in his most recent attempt at redemption, he doesn't completely succeed: He simply cannot refrain from being the typical Spielberg with his heavy-handed, lofty and ultimately sappy direction. The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as REALITY :the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I couldn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowd-pleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to "keep it real", you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. However, THE reason to view this film is the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the "Wild Bunch"). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and stimultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind. The last one,(a small group of men versus a veritable army - hmmm,where have I seen THIS before?) is almost as good, if not for the cheap Hollywood trick at the very end, which finds the movie venturing into Indiana Jones territory. It almost seems that SPR was directed by TWO different people: Spielberg and his WWII battle consultant. On the very primal level, however, the film achieves at least one of its makers' many aspirations: when I exited the theatre, I felt lucky to be alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts as a good Anti-War movie. Graphic depictions of what a bullet really does,etc BUT at some points we are subjected to 'glory' scenes which destroy the feeling of abhorrence gained in the first 30 minutes. It is truly a great war movie? It has a very basic story line, it is well filmed, the special effects are fantastic, but if directors of war movies in the past had access to these technological advances, perhaps their films would have been just as good, if not better. Are we judging this film on the thought behind it or on what we see in front of us?</fullReview>

I saw this movie last week and I'm still lying awake thinking about it and what the real war heroes went through.

		<shortDescription>The second best anti-war movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has once again proved himself to be a true master of his chosen profession. The attention given to minute detail and photography is simply outstanding. Technically brilliant, the film strikes at every man's primal fears when faced with danger. The themes of heroism, cowardice, loyalty, existentialism and redemption are beautifully woven into a fictional story revolving around the finding of one man, namely Pvt. Ryan. But realistic (awesome, I may say) battle scenes aside, I still say it is not the best war film ever made. Still sitting upon that mantle is "All Quiet on the Western Front." For better or worse, "Pvt. Ryan" does not take a holistic view of war as it affected all sections of society. Of course, it may have not been intention to do so, and the films certainly have a different focus. But for depth of story, "Quiet" is unparalleled for content. All that aside, "Pvt. Ryan" is still tied, along with "Schindler's List" for the honor of the most important movies of the past two decades. In my opinion "Pvt. Ryan" is to war films as "2001" is to sci-fi films. As an ex-Marine I was forced to think about the 12 landings my grandfather made during WWII against the Japanese. Did he go through hell? Did he think about the meaning of bravery and honor? Or did he shake and cry, and pray to God for forgiveness and hope for a better life for all? Go see "Pvt. Ryan" and allow your mind to wonder and explore the meaning of humanity. If you come away unmoved, then you're not human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is a no holes barred epic film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and two time Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks have collaborated on their first film and might well add to that collection come Oscar night. Saving Private Ryan is a no holes barred epic film about a group of Rangers who land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and then get sent on a very personal mission, to find one man who has parachuted behind enemy lines and is being sent home because his three older brothers have all been casualties of war.The first 30 minutes of SPR is filled with seemingly never-ending images of the savagery and brutality of war. It is the landing at Omaha Beach on June 6 (aka D-Day). Hanks plays everyman Captain John Miller, who leads his men into battle there. Some survive the carnage but many do not. The imagery is fierce and honest from the opening of the first transport to the blood washed beaches at the end. In the middle of this film we have a philosophical dilemma which Miller's men try to sort out - is one man worth the lives of 9 men (Miller and his elite team)? And in the course of trying to answer this question we get to know John Miller and his first sergeant Horvath (well-played by Tom Sizemore), his sharp-shooter Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), his translator Corporal Upham (superbly acted by Jeremy Davies) and the other men in his unit - Edward Burns as Private Reiben - the NY bred, cocky recruit, Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) who is Jewish and takes great satisfaction in killing Germans and who also plays a prominent role in an unforgettable scene at the film's conclusion, Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) who becomes frustrated over his inability to save everyone, and Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) who tries to save a young French girl in the face of sniper fire. But it is Hanks who holds the film and the unit together with his quiet determination.Also admirable in smaller roles are Ted Danson as another Captain who helps Miller's unit track down Ryan and Dennis Farina as a Lieutenant, Harve Presnell as General George Marshall, whose decision to extract Private Ryan will change the lives of 10 men forever and Matt Damon as Private Ryan.Not for the faint of heart, this movie pulls no punches and spares no one as the human carnage continues throughout the film but particularly at the end where the juxtapositioning of the troops listening to a German love song while preparing to ambush some German tanks trying to traverse the bridge at Ravell lends an eerie quality to the eventual fighting and emotionally charged climax of the film.One thing is for sure - once you have seen this movies you will never look upon World War II in quite the same way.Not to be missed, see this on the big screen and in a THX theatre and prepare to be devastated</fullReview>

But when the first twenty minutes are over and done with there is nothing there to see, the patheticly boring insight into Tom Hanks' character is a mere side track to keep the audience interested. The film is no doubt good, but only for the way in which it portrays war, bloody. Even so Spielberg goes over the top in some instances. When the German sniper is killed in the village church tower, you didn't need to see his brains splattered all over the wall, unlike the D-Day landings when it was important to get a feel for what it was like. In general this film was over-hyped and Hanks in no way deserves an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Realistic War Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielburg's epic of the quest for one man is not so simple. There is much more involved in the story. The first twenty minutes show the horror and brutality of war.My jaw was wide open. I could not believe it. I had never seen this aspect of war before. I knew about it, but it didn't register. It made me think of all the other battles--Gettysburg--and movements not only in Europe but also in the Pacific. Men died for me, and I took this freedom for granted. After the highly ironic ending I was glued to my seat. I was so touched that I could not move. I could only sit and continue to realize that this really happened. Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance and is greatly assisted by the supporting roles. The score that John Williams composed does not steal the show, but it also adds to the overall impact of the film. The story is only a script, but it is truer to life than ever before. The cinamatography adds to the effect. By seeing war for what it is, (There are no winners)I hope and pray we never go to war in haste again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did we find such men?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" provides, in stark relief, a portrait of the American infantryman in World War II. For those looking for a whiney anti-war film in the Vietnam tradition, this isn't it. The men portrayed in "Saving Private Ryan" are American soldiers of the 1940's who realize that, like it or not, they stand between the dark night of Nazi tyranny and freedom for millions. They have truly gone in harm's way. In case you are still unfamiliar with the story, Private Ryan is the sole survivor of four brothers who are serving in the military. Two are killed in the Normandy invasion, a third has been killed a short time earlier at New Guinea in the Pacific Theater. Army Chief of Staff George Marshall is so trouble by the prospect that another family will lose all of its sons to the war, that he orders a small unit of eight men to find the surviving Ryan. Marshall is haunted by the deaths of the five Sullivan brothers who all perished when the ship on which they served went down in the Pacific. Marshall is clearly not doing this as an Army publicity stunt. A letter he posseses which was written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who made a similar sacrifice during the War Between the States also spurs Marshall into action. Ryan parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne Division the night before the beach actions and, thus, will be difficult to find. The men on the rescue mission are just guys. Nothing special about them. The thing that makes them stand out is their determination to just do their job. They're not sure why Ryan is so special, but they intend to find out or die trying.This is Tom Hanks at his best. His portrayal of a World War II officer is never better than when he gives his men their last minute instructions in the landing craft. He ends by saying, "And I'll see you on the beach." His quiet confidence is remarkable and accurate.Barry Pepper is excellent as the unit's Tennessee born and bred sniper and Giovanni Ribisi is outstanding as the medic. If you're looking for an anti-war "message" movie, this one isn't it. It's about duty, honor and the type of men who stood on the ramparts during one of the world's darkest hours. After seeing this, go thank a World War II veteran. Plenty of them traded their tomorrows so we could have today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant companion piece by Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan offers viewers a stunning companion piece to Spielberg's previous WW2 classic Schildler's List, although exceptional in its own right, Saving Private Ryan gives a completely different take on the conflict. Schindler's List examines the the evil of the war and what is was that people were fighting for, Saving Private Ryan gives us, in no uncertain terms a insight into the savagery of war and the senselessness of armed conflict. It reminds us that during conflict people die in the most horrible ways immaginable and that good people sacrifice their lives for the cause. If taken on its own Saving Private Ryan would seem to say that war is a senseless waste of human life and that there is no justification for this activity, but when added to the message in Schindlers's List, which showed us the evil which the war strove to eliminate, one is left asking the question.When is the cause worth the cost?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the mission really one man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of us, fortunate to have only read about, and not experienced, the kind of action portrayed in "Saving Private Ryan", that portrayal accomplishes complete suspension of disbelief, and leaves us completely exhausted by its end. The only other film of its genre that has the same effect is Wolfgang Petersen's "Das Boot".If the viewers draw moral conclusions strictly from the material Spielberg provides, many if not most will conclude that making war should NEVER be an option. Of course, Spielberg scrupulously avoids any explanation for the presence and actions of Captain Miller's men other than rescuing this one man. This is in contrast to "Schindler's List", which is a continuous justification for using whatever force is necessary to liberate the innocent and punish the guilty. Perhaps unsurprisingly, "Schindler's List" liberates the innocent without any evidence of men like Captain Miller, his squad, or the millions of other GIs that made it possible.How could Spielberg, if he wanted to, have combined the two, giving the viewer a sense of the reaction of those occupied by the Nazis to the Allied landings, yet not completely switch the film out of context?Consider the film "Playing for Time". This TV film, released approximately ten years ago, achieved extreme notoriety even before its release by virtue of its central casting of Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave's extreme political left wing views are regrettably, considering her occupation, tainted with a devotion to the cause of Palestinian statehood. She played a Jewish woman in a Nazi labor camp. The film recounts the "real world" assembly of musically talented female inmates, who form a small orchestra and perform for the camp Nazis. As long as they played, they gained time. The continuous horror of "life" in a labor camp is interrupted very briefly when, just before the start of a concert, a male technician arranges something on stage in front of Ms. Redgrave, and opens his palm to her sight. On the skin is written "Allies landing in France". He closes his palm and goes on with his work. Redgrave gives the slightest of all smiles, but one which the viewer understands is a shout of joy. It will be over. Survival is possible.This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in "Schindler's List".Chester Wilmot's "The Struggle For Europe" describes an event he witnessed during the liberation of Brussels. He writes "In one square the [British] tanks were halted by the [Belgian civilian] throng and the Brussels police attempted to move the crowd back, but they could not restrain one little old woman who wore on her drab black dress her husband's medals from another war. She made a quick dart across to the nearest jeep, took the hand of the driver, kissed it, and said, 'Je vous remercie, Tommie. Je vous remercie.' And into his hand she pressed what was obviously all that she had -- three cigarettes."This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in "Saving Private Ryan".I am extremely fortunate to have a father who was a Normandy to Berlin GI, and a mother who was a Belgian native, lived under the Nazi occupation, and could very well have been in that Brussels crowd that day. Through their eyes I saw as much as anyone could second hand. This is not a luxury available to many people today. The WW2 generation is dying, and they are dying with the knowledge of what happened, why it happened, and how to avoid having it happen again. Spielberg has the responsibility to pass that information on, and in that respect, both "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" are failures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading some of the above comments, it becomes obvious that some people are busy composing their criticisms when they would do better to watch the film. e.g. why didn't the high command just radio instructions to send Ryan home instead of sending a squad after him? The answer is in the film. if you're paying attention. The airborne forces, were scattered, lost, decimated by casualties and out of touch with what was going on generally - which is, by the way, historically accurate.Also to address the moans about the lack of characterisation among the US soldiers. If you met such a group in real life they would probably appear just as 2-dimensional. Soldiers in combat only relate to each other - they don't care about anyone else. Through their shared experiences, they already know each other intimately, and nobody else counts outside of their immediate circle. So nobody else gets to see the real side of their characters. Let's not forget that these men are in a war, not a Chekhov play.As to the "standard mix" of soldier's backgrounds, this is the way armies organise their units. If units all consisted of men from the same town or area, the social consequences can be disastrous if that unit suffers heavy losses, as with the British "Pals" battalions of the First World War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claimed Reality Is Flawed But Film Is Still Worth It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am a thirty year military professional many people have asked my opinion of the film. This is it in a nutshell:The Weapons:The thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.The Sniper:The sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.The Uniforms:The field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.The Battle Scenes:Every one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less "gory" than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompsons was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in ... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.The Characters:This is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the "war". These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks charachter took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the green barets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch "They Were Expendable". To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.The Plot:I could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.What I did like:The cinemaphotography was superb. The sound was great. It was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire I have heard on film. Still, this wasn't consistent throughout. The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was a better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it really does to people. It really was much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!---Not Native English, so forgive my mistakes.---!!!When the first 30 minutes started, i almost forgot to drink my soft drink. Some guys left the movie with their girlfriends, i guess they couldn't face the real like of WW2.Action films usually show that, "Face/Off", -which is a fairly good movie, but in another category- the main characters aren't vulnerable to bullets. They can dance in the line of fire, and they never get hit. That's not possible.SPR showed me the real way, the opposite of what Face Off could come up with. I realized that i want to hide, i don't want to move, because the feeling being on the battlefield. The surround was perfect, and the storyboard was ok too.My only question is that: Is the goverment really think like the guy in the film? I mean i don't think that the Defense minister of the United States can make decisions like "Save that Ryan guy because of his mother!". I don't think so. But i'm not an American, so maybe i misunderstood something.It was good not to see everyone surviving, and showing many kind of soldiers.Not everyone can fight! That's okay!Thank you very much!</fullReview>

Even if they are few are far between. Spielberg shows us all that he is still master of his craft. In a post-Titanic wake, Hollywood was in desperate need of such a film.

		<shortDescription>An intelligent film. See it twice and think about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some thoughts about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (SPR).It's an intelligent and carefully made film. You must view it intelligently and carefully, and see it two or three times to be able to see the detail.It will be a misunderstood film, I think. Naturally, there is no ONE right way to view a film. The better the film, the more ways it can be viewed. But SPR has already been evaluated in a very unidimensional way.People have commented that there is a good action sequence at the beginning, a good action sequence at the end, a long boring middle with no character development, and 'bookend' sentimentality. The "opening 25 minutes" were very realistic...but is that all that the film is about? You can view it that way, but perhaps the film is more than a technically masterful B-film.The film's message is "war is hell"? If that's all it was, it would be shallow realism. A dog has four feet, war is hell, sugar is sweet. These are just preconditions for telling a story. Consider this possibility: that the realism and attention to detail is MORE than the sound of bullets against steel or sand.Shallow character development? You don't know enough about the soldiers to care? What's that supposed to mean? That you look at a cross-filled cemetery and feel nothing? That you see a landing boat full of men killed before they can disembark and you feel nothing because you don't know who they were? Think about this: veterans report not wanting to know anything about their fellow combatants. It made the loss more difficult. And isn't it interesting that part of the story of SPR has to do with the soldiers wondering who Captain Miller is. Why don't you ask yourself why? Character development? The war context has to do with how you behave there and then. That's how you assess each other. Now: think about whether such a message can be carried to other everyday contexts. Observe the soldiers and how they behave. That long 'boring' bit in the middle?? That's the whole film! Look at the events and think: why am I being shown this? Why not something else? Isn't it interesting that the ONE German soldier that Upham kills is the one who both killed Miller AND witnessed Upham's own failure to live up to his responsibilities (cowardice?).Go see the film a second time and think about it. Ask yourself: why, amid the chaos of the Omaha beach landing, we are not only shown slow motion pans of Miller staring without comprehension at corpses and men cringed in fear, but also of him later, equally white-faced, staring at coffee being poured, at a man shaving, at a sandwich being eaten?A good film can work at several levels. Is this a war film? An anti-war film? Is that all that SPR is about? If so, then the so-called bookend pieces are indeed cheap sentimentality. But consider another hypothesis: Perhaps the film is also a character study of one person in particular, of Captain Miller. And it's not simply about 'war'. The war is a context to make something else meaningful. No, not just "earn this", something else.When I saw the film there was a veteran who began crying when another message was given, at the very end.Interesting, wasn't it, that we don't hear triumphant music and see the stars and stripes in full glory. We could have been shown this, but we weren't. We see a bleached out remnant of something almost unrecognizable as stars and stripes, and music dying away in a long sad whisper. Earlier, we hear Miller's own comments on the standard Emersonian line on the value of war "Perhaps that's his way of seeing the good side of things". You can accuse Spielberg of being a sentimentalist. Miller HIMSELF would not buy the sentimentality interpretation.Whatever else the film might be, SPR is also good enough to give me something to think about after I view it. Something else, about the rest of everyday life. Don't waste your time thinking about whether it's the best film ever,or the best war film ever, or how many academy awards it will win. Who cares?Forget about that guy looking for his arm on Omaha beach.View the film and then think about this: Are YOU a good person? Are YOU living a good life?Then go back and look again at those dying and dead strangers and weep for your own life.Perhaps Spielberg made a better film than he intended...</fullReview>

What this movie does is bring to life the realities of war, at least as far as it can for someone who never has and probably never will be there.To the people who would wish to go to war for any reason, watch this first. To those who would dodge military service of this country, yet still call themselves Americans and reap the rewards of those who did, watch this movie and think about all of the kids who did your job for you. To those who would exercise their right to burn the American flag in protest, watch this movie and consider the price at which that right was purchased.Although I realize that it isn't much, it is heartfelt when I say to all of the people who have ever fought in or who have lost loved ones in a war, "Thank you", from a grateful citizen.</fullReview>

It maintains a high level in all its other aspects. The first 5 minutes of battle are just what I expected. There are many original points not present in most war films, and there are even funny points in the dialogue. Ah, one more thing... I also must say that perhaps I made a 'mistake' before going to the theatre: I read the user comments at the IMDb... In them, people say things like 'it's the best war film in history', or 'I'm not the same after watching this movie'. Well, I must admit it's a great war movie, but nothing else, at least for me. Of course, it's not the best film ever created. Anyway, you shouldn't miss it. My rating is 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the most hauntingly realistic movie of all time. While sitting in the theater witnessing this extraordinary piece of cinema history, I couldn't help but think about what it must have been like that day, in Normandy. Although I felt like I was right there on the beach with the brave soldiers who risked, and gave their lives for us. This is a movie that makes you think. Oscar caliber performances delivered by every member of the cast, especially Tom Hanks. The story involves Private Ryan, who's brothers died in the d-day invasion, and the eight men sent to return him home. Eight men sent to save one may be unfair, but their soldiers and will follow orders, no matter what the cost. This movie has many very gory moments, but what else do you expect from the man who brought you Schindler's List and Amistad, Steven Spielberg. This is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend it to anyone who can handle it. It's been said that war is hell. But I can't imagine a hell being any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the many years of films being released many have been named outstanding and have been given 4 stars. The Godfather, Star Wars, The Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, and The Godfather Part II all stand a big place in film history. However I was never expecting a film to be as important as Schindler's List until now and by the same director. Steven Spielberg has once again made easily one of the best and most important films of all time. Many past war films have tried to be important but nothing has came as close to reality as Saving Private Ryan. From the scenes of graphically violent war where gun shots are the only noise you can hear to the different aspects each character has it is definitely the most realistic war film ever made. After seeing this film you will be reminded of the many people who have died for our freedom today and what it is really like to be on a battlefield. Some people may find it to graphic to watch but must know that this is a true story and this is how graphic a war is. Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen and if there are movies in the future that are even better than this one, not many will forget this film and many of the scenes you see in it will be kept in your head for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with all the hype I had absorbed, I was not prepared for the brutality depicted in this film. Perhaps it is not possible to be prepared. Perhaps that is good. As I squirmed and cowered in my chair during the initial battle sequence, I was asking what now, where now before any of the characters did. I had become involved in the story emotionally without wanting or choosing to. I cared about these people and therefore when the plot threatened them, I felt threatened. When they relaxed. I relaxed. In that way, this film brought to me an understanding of war from the soldiers point of view that is otherwise impossible to get without being there. To me that is the measure of the film's merit. This is a great film, with subtlety and understatement sometimes lacking in Spielberg earlier films. I am heartened that a talent as technically adept as Spielberg is maturing into a true master of the art of film. Everyone who can stand it must see this movie.</fullReview>

But the plot allowed Spielberg to show first person not just the most realistic landing scenes ever made, but allowed him to continue into the confusion of the airborne assault the night before in a way that has never been shown before.The haunting scene that will always remain with me is the view from the German defensive positions, showing them waiting for the ramp of the landing craft to open so they could fire their machine gun into the densely packed men on the craft.I believe this movie should be shown in every school in the United States, every year, so our children can know what sacrifices their parents and grandparents made in the past.

		<shortDescription>A VISUAL MASTERPIECE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg films come with high expectations. You've come to expect a sense of wonderment, of magic, of taking the audience places they've never been to before in film. Unfortunately, as Spielberg has said himself, his films the past few years have not touched or grabbed us the way they used to. This is most likely due to a combination of our high expectations and Spielberg's losing touch with the general public.That said, "Saving Private Ryan" has well exceeded my expectations and may be the finest film of his career.This film shows you how powerful movies can be. Marrying the creative, ingenious minds of Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski with new film technology provides us with the most realistic war movie ever made.The opening 24-minute invasion sequence relentlessly assaults your eyes &amp; ears. The combination of jerky camera movement (by using hand-held cameras) , stuttered framing (by skipping some frames), special film (for grittiness) , slow motion, surround sound, and perfect choreography make this section of the film an instant classic and worth the price of admission. From the second the ramp drops on one of the landing crafts, the audience is a participant in this invasion. I peered around the audience for a few seconds and as the bombs and explosions reflected light off their faces I was able to see their eyes. In them, I saw fear, shock, horror and disbelief.There are two scenes, which bookend the movie, that force you to absorb the carnage &amp; chaos of war at a deep level. In both scenes, you are watching the bloody battle all around you through Captain John Miller's (played by Tom Hanks) eyes. The sounds of gunfire and explosions which only moments before were piercing your ears are now all but silent. These two surreal and haunting scenes provide the audience with a few seconds to step back, feel themselves breathing heavier, feel their hearts beating faster and truly see the horror &amp; devastation of war. Another scene that will stay with you is seeing Corporal Upham (played by Jeremy Davies), glued to a stairwell, panic ridden with fright.Acting: Barry Pepper as Private Jackson the expert marksman and Tom Sizemore as tough Sergeant Horvath stood out among the cast. Hollywood plot devices (e.g., family gathered at cemetery, airplane appearance, etc) and weak dialogue at times, prevent this film from being a true 4 star classic. Never the less, this is still the most realistic and powerful war film ever made and will be remembered throughout the annuls of film history.The film is rated R due to graphic violence. The film may be disturbing for war veterans who may not want to invoke their battlefield memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a perfect "10" but what's the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this movie was excellent I did agree with some comments, about how the old man Ryan scenes were played for sympathy and how character development was a bit stunted, but I think that's part of the point. These aren't supposed to be complex characters with inner demons or personal problems, they're supposed to be ordinary joes, just like the millions of others who fought and died. If you were going to develop personalities you 'd either have to cut out the fighting or make that movie REALLY long. In that respect I had no problem. About the believability of rescuing one man, have you at all been paying attention?!! The Sullivan Law which prevents all of a family's sons from being killed in combat had been mentioned ad nauseam, so they had to rescue him, it was the freakin law! How is that "romantic Hollywood"? Someone also said that the point of the movie was to say "war is bad, well duh." Well then,. I say "duh" right back to you because don't you think Spielberg already assumed we know that? He's not that stupid to make a movie with such a superficial, obvious message. One of the main goals, in addition to depicting the reality of war, was to show all of us how much we take freedom for granted. Example: how many of you actually celebrate Veterans or Memorial Days in memoriam for people who served in combat, and how many of you simply go "woohoo, no school/work today", like it's just a holiday? People celebrate martyrs, and that's good , but how are the poor shlubs who went to die when freedom really was on the line any less important? To paraphrase a source, if they failed, whether or not you can imagine it, we'd all be doing the "Zieg heil". I have been nowhere near a war and wouldn't want to after having seen this film, but the only people whose opinions about the honesty and treatment of the subject matter matter at all to me are those who have been through and seen such carnage as in the war. Of all the veterans of WWII who I've seen interviewed about this film, I have yet to see one who says that movie sucked or was only okay. The reason I trust the realism of it, for one thing, is because they had advisors who experienced sh*t like that firsthand. Truth is everything is subjective. You can read lots of stuff and watch tons of films on war and have a good imagination but you honestly can't say a damn thing about it until you've been through one yourself. I am part cynic, but I do not think the purpose of this movie was to win Oscars. Why shouldn't a movie like this deserve to win anything but sound and visual awards anyway? Platoon did. After seeing this movie I have a greater understanding and appreciation of our history. I'm all for the freedom to express opinions, but I'd like to see someone do as good a job or better with such profound material (a statement not yet, if at all, applicable to The Thin Red Line). I'm no filmmaker but that movie was pretty darn good. Oscar-worthy? I don't know. There are still months left in the Oscar year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most powerful war films of all time. The most intense, graphic direction to come from Steven Spielberg, with superbly innovative cinematography, editing and sound. Performances were all around excellent. Supporting characters are surprisingly as strong as Tom Hanks in the lead. Modern day bookend is the only thing that detracts from the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle scenes good. Nothing added to genre. Basic shoot em up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just been to see. Very good war movie. Battle scenes deserve all praise they are getting. Does not add anything to war genre or why people go to war. Bit shallow and American gung ho/smultz. Basically a shoot 'em up. The redeeming factor is that it shows that gore and the viciousness of war and the brutality of the US soldier did not just appear with Vietnam. Cross of Iron does the good/bad honour/dishonour etc much better I think. Apocalypse Now is better at the mission is a journey to find ones self stuff. Battle of Algiers as documentary style. That said worth it just for the battle scenes. Would go and see again at the pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the best war movie that I ever seen. Before seeing it I had heard that it was amazingly realistic and that some war veterans had to abandon it after 30 minutes because of horrific memories flooding back. And I have to agree with this. The opening 25 minutes or so in particular are like nothing I have ever witnessed. Some of the scenes of the dead and wounded are really gruesome but this only adds to the overwhelming effect this film has on all who see it.It is quite a long film but it doesn't feel it. I was disappointed when it ended because I was enjoying it so much. Spielberg really captures the essence of war in this film and hopefully would make all who see it realize the grim reality of war and turn them against violence for life. All I have left to say is that if you haven't gone out to see Saving Private Ryan yet, do so now, it really is as good as everyone says it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific brilliance that no-one should miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd read plenty of reviews both here and in magazines before I saw this film - most described was the first twenty minutes of the movie concerning the Omaha beach landings in France. The horrors written in those text prepared me for what I knew were going to be gruesome scenes - or so I thought. Wrong WRONG WRONG. The first twenty minutes will be stuck etched on my brain until I die - if nothing else they serve as the best reason I've ever seen for pacifism. When the first boat lands and the bullets rip the occupants to shreds you feel you are right there with them - then you know that no film review will do justice to the visuals in this film. To say it 's the best war movie ever made is a kind of injustice - I didn't feel I was watching a war film more a documentary. You've seen people shot before a million times on film and tv right? Wrong again - you feel every bullet thats fired in this film and beleive me every one feels and sounds like a hot piece of metal that kills. When the first twenty minutes are over you feel numb and you stay like that until the last image of the film has left the screen. To complain about the plot is essentially pointless - sure its straight forward and sure its one sided (the germans all being depicted as pretty much emotionless skinheads - the only one in the film for any length of time being a nasty piece of work who you want to die anyway) but I dont think this is meant as a film in that way. To me it's a document of the horrors of war and of the futility of it - If I were a young man thinking of joining the forces before seeing this I'd rip the application form up after, any romantic ideals of that lifestyle get ripped up with it in this film.See this movie, be hurt and haunted by it's images but most of all remember it as a document of why we are free today.Sometimes I wonder why they bothered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are many better "war movies," but not as visual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another movie that is considered great simply because the name Spielberg is attached. If not for the hyper-realistic combat scenes, this film would simply be average.On the plus side, the movie takes full advantage of today's audiovisual technology to provide the most immersive film experience dealing with war - - any war. The violence is so realistic and plentiful it's at times desensitizing, a common feeling among soldiers in World War II.On the negative side, the movie revolves around the gore and the combat, and as a result fails to resolve many of the questions the movie raises -- namely whether risking an entire group is worth saving one man.There are many other movies that more strongly illustrate the wide range of attitudes, emotions, and pure brutality of war; among those, All Quiet On The Western Front (the original), The Big Red One, and Platoon involve the viewer on a much deeper emotional and intellectual level than this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about the opening battle scene at Normandy and the climactic final scene in the village? They are probably the two best war scenes ever recorded on film. The images from the beach landing will haunt me for a long time; the soldiers praying, crying, vomiting, and then dying, dying so fast and furious you don't even have time to breathe before the next one goes down. And yet they are all very human, which is what breaks your heart. The same can be said of the final battle scene. The way the momentary peace of listening to Edith Piaf singing in French while the educated young soldier interprets for the others is shattered by the rumbling of the treads of the German tanks. Your brain starts going, why is this happening? For this reason, the reality and ridiculousness of war is made clear. There are other good scenes in this poignant and terrifying film; most of the deaths are treated with the shock of cold reality and at the same time with dignity. However, I was totally disgusted by the director's 'good guy vs. bad guy' depiction of the Nazi soldiers. I'm sure that the Germans loved their mothers, too, that they were afraid to die, that they were also following orders from above, and not deranged Hitlers. The lone German character in the film is portrayed as a sick, evil clown, and that is all we're allowed to see him as. How sad that we have to do that to appreciate what our soldiers did for us. Woudldn't it have made it an even better statement if the movie had shown us how crazy war is from BOTH sides of the fence? It was an opportunity lost.Beyond that, I agree with the other viewer that I also would have appreciated seeing the daily hardships that the soldiers must have gone through; the cold, the wet, the hunger, etc. I think this would have made it a more complete and realistic film.Still, congratulations to Spielberg. He gave us his heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of fictional reality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has found a place in my all time top ten. I can't name the other nine right off of the top of my head but I have to say that this movie would be in it. There isn't a lot you can say to explain this movie because it's a huge, heaping dose of reality encased in three hours of film. The plot is simple, four brothers go off to war, three die, and the government wants to bring the sole surviving Ryan brother home. After a grueling and gruesome landing at Omaha Beach, the men who are sent after him search all over the war theater of Europe during WWII for the lone, living Ryan brother. Still, if they had tacked much more of a plot on to the movie with the time they used, it wouldn't have had the same impact. The movie would have to have been longer. I wouldn't have minded if it had been. The characters don't have a lot of time to be developed, due to the nature of war and the film, but the parts are all well delivered and acted, (I'm sure at least partially to the direction of Spielberg), but it is Tom Hanks that makes it all stick together. I read another review of this movie which said that Tom Hanks' performance was "a quiet miracle". This is the most accurate description of the part he plays that I have read to date. This movie illustrates the differences between modern/faces-never-seen warfare and warfare of a past era. You have to wonder after seeing this movie if violence wouldn't be so prevalent in our world if it war was now as it once was in the past. The first 45 minutes of this movie are so overwhelming I would be surprised if a person could bring themselves to speak after it. In fact, I've never been in a theater with such silence throughout an entire movie, (except for when I saw Highlander II, and that silence was more due to disappointment and disgust than any profound impact ). The whole sequence of events moves at such break-neck speed, with such reality, that you forget there is a camera filming it all. At times, it seems as if you're seeing it all through the eyes of someone on the field of battle. The climax of the film, in relation to the beginning of the film, has a slight plot twist, (that's how I perceived it), that makes the whole thing come together plot-wise, and it attempts to give a little tug at the heart strings- I didn't mind. I should say, as I finish this, that this isn't a movie for those with weak stomachs. The movie isn't filled with blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore. It is VERY realistic though, almost sickeningly so. Take all of the war movies ever made, strip away the bravado, the glory, the bravery, and the chest clutching sort of "tough guy" attitudes, throw in the violence and horrific injury that accompanies that kind of combat and you'll have the feeling of a good part of "Saving Private Ryan" - at least I think so. Basically, I wouldn't take the kids to it and I wouldn't go if the sight of blood makes you ill. Amazing, impacting, overwhelming, horrifying, and realistic are words I would use to describe this movie. Wow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Kind of Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time you read this, you'll probably know what Saving Private Ryan is all about without even seeing the film. Sure the fighting scenes were realistic and etc... but this is not what drew me to this film. Now, I'm no expert in movies and I haven't seen a lot of old war movies, (The only one I've seen is The Longest Day), but I think this movie stands out among the others because it is real. The characters are real. They don't have incredible luck, beating odds every time. You see grown men crying out for their mothers, screaming out in pain when they're hit... The movie focuses on the characters, the people. It shows the human side of this war. It shows how men devolve into savage creatures who are just trying to survive. It shows that every life taken, is another bit of humanity that is lost. (eg. shooting surrendering prisoners. beating up a POW). The mission they're assigned is probably one of the only good deeds they will accomplish in the war. The little bit of humanity that is left in them compels them accomplish their objective, and helps them redeem their soul. The team dispatched to save Private Ryan, evolves from a group of savages trying to survive to a higher moral level. A level in which they are willing to sacrifice their lives to do something good, something they rarely do.Now you may disagree with my point of view, I don't really care but whether you agree or not, you have to see Saving Private Ryan. You a least owe it to the veterans to see what they faced when they fought for our freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most honest movie about war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often a movie will glamorize the act of armed conflict. Making it sexy, or romantic. Case in point would be Starship Troopers. We watched people die constantly, and we, the audience, hardly noticed or cared.Spielberg did it right. I am a soldier in an Army town, and the movie theater was silent, silent because what we saw wasn't glamorous. It was honest, and the truth was very blunt. We were forced to watch people die, people panic, and people that actually behaved like real people.We saw a compelling view of the mettle required to be a leader in combat. Hanks undertook the role of a Captain as the Army would like its officers to be. He was focused on his Mission and his Commander's intent. He had to lead those that weren't motivated, and he even had to be human and deal with his own shortcomings.This movie inspires patriotism, but it defines war as a sobering test of a soldier's true character, and dedication. It is not for the timid. However Schindler's List showed Spielberg's talent for honest perspective</fullReview>

Full Metal Jacket was a more honest film, with a more unflinching look at the horrors of war and free of any little circular plot devices to tie it neatly together. The greatest anti-war film IMHO was "Prisoner of the Mountain", a film that came out of Russia a couple of years ago.</fullReview>

Many times I thought of walking out, mostly out of sheer boredom. I kept dreaming of scissors!

I told my family---"but wait you'll be dragging a loss of nearly $20.00, let's stay, we'll cut it to pieces during supper!") And the dialogue: how many war movies did they cut-and-paste to come up with such witticisms as "I don;t give a blankety blank about this blankety war...I want to go . home..."And my most favorite quotation: " all these men dead for one man!" In summary I've seen dozens of more interesting and truly more representative war movies.My summary of the movie, is "what else is new.!" You don't have to go digging into the annals of history for carnage. Reserve your seat at your local hospital emergency room on any Saturday night!I didn't learn much from this movie, perhaps nothing at all. And goodness, how long it was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was asked to write a one sentence review of Saving Private Ryan, it would have to be this: Saving Private Ryan is the single greatest movie ever made. Quite simply, no other film has personally moved, inspired, educated, and brought me to tears like Saving Private Ryan did. Nearly every single element of the film is perfect. Spielberg's direction is unbelievable, Hanks' performance is probably the greatest that I have ever witnessed, and the story and script are awe-inspiring. I could go on and on, but you probably get the point. Saving Private Ryan is unbelievable, and you should immediately go to see if you haven't had the opportunity to do so. Saving Private Ryan is rated R for extreme violence and a heavy dosage of profanity. The MPAA actually considered giving it and NC-17 due to the extreme realism that it portrays. Fortunately, however, they didn't. Every single American, no matter what the age, should be required to see this movie. Don't let the strong rating and its respective reasons scare you away. The insight into war that this movie portrays is unsurpassed. See it on the big screen while you can.</fullReview>

The opening few minutes are some of the most visually stunning in movie history , and the story keeps you involved and really caring about Miller and his team from the landing on D-Day right up to the end. While most certainly not a movie for children of any age, everyone old enough to appreciate it should see this film. Spielberg and Hanks should both get Oscars for this effort, and the film should win best picture for sure. Definitely one to be remembered!</fullReview>

I am a huge fan of action movies (Face/Off, The Rock, and those types), and the violence in those is so overblown and off the wall that its fun. The war scenes in Saving Private Ryan are far from fun. They are graphic and brutal. That's what makes the movie powerful. While reading another person's comment, they said "this is nothing like real combat." I can't disagree with them, because I have never seen real combat. I can, however, say that it shows that war is not something that should be glorified, it is a brutal and painful experience, and besides that, it is a story very well told.</fullReview>

I don't cherish the thought of charging on a battlefield anymore. What I did in DS was antiseptic and was NOTHING like what someone would encounter on the ground. I really felt like I was there with those ground troops... I don't ever want to be there for real. Just that small taste of the real horrors of war is enough for me.Even so, if I am called to defend my country once again, I would do it.

		<fullReview>Never before have I seen a movie with the same emotional impact as Saving Private Ryan. Steven Spielberg, as usual, has put together an incredible movie. The cinematography, especially in the opening sequence where he puts you in the middle of the action as though you were there, is stunning. The acting is superb, as you'd expect from Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast is stellar as well.If it has any flaw, the movie asks you to suspend disbelief, for why would the army risk the lives of eight men just to save one? Needless to say, I couldn't question that while watching the movie because of how good it was. It was long, but I thought it was worth every minute of it.I don't cry in movies. It just isn't my thing. But the end of this film was so moving I couldn't help myself. If you don't like realistic violence , don't see this movie. If you don't like to be moved, don't see this movie. But if you want to see a gripping, realistic look at war and possibly the greatest movie ever made, see Saving Private Ryan. It's an A+ in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie at least the first 20 minutes or more seal my opinion of the film,and the rest was rather curious at least to the last half an hour of the movie. Now,as a civilian,born 1958,I certainly don't have the experience to talk about this war,but I watched documentaries that bring tears to my eyes. I assume that I am personally not friendly with many serviceman in civilian life past or present,but I deeply respect the blood that was given and that they continue to give since it was and is the price of my freedom! I am black,and aware that this period was not the best for black servicemen ;nevertheless I am proud of the (WW2)servicemen white,black,and any other race of Americans,that served during that period. I hate to see in films about (WW2)American soldiers dying or being killed. I didn't notice in this film any black soldiers,but that wouldn't make me any less proud of the superhuman courage as represented by the actors in this film as white soldiers under such inconceivable pressure to secure the freedom that I take for granted. I didn't at first want to see this movie,because I thought that it was nothing more than a big budget film,and that it would depict a theme of heroism that was going to be a romance about gun-ho characters. The characters were very human,and the late actor (John Wayne) if he was in this movie as one of the characters his character would have been scared silly by the battle scenes in this film(no one is dying pretty in this film )! It is a real war movie or the real deal of fighting,suffering,and dying !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" left me with some of the conflicted feelings I'd had toward Spielberg's "Schindler's List" -- I wanted to admire the film, but as powerful as parts of it were, I felt it didn't quite achieve what it was reaching for. The first half-hour offers a searing re-creation of the invasion of Normandy, rightly so. But after that chaotic, gory opening, the movie seems to lose its way. Steven Spielberg apparently wanted to make an epic film -- without any epic characters. (At least "Schindler's List" had Oskar Schindler.) The American soldiers who are assigned to try to save Private Ryan are, with the exception of Captain Miller and Corporal Upham, pretty much ciphers. Someone might reply, "You're missing the point -- men in combat usually don't have time to get well acquainted." But "Private Ryan" doesn't seem to be about the anonymity of war. This is not to say it needed the jolly, ragtag group of stereotypes you'd get in a John Wayne war picture. But the characters -- the ones we care about -- should have loomed a bit larger. And while Spielberg gets credit for avoiding the clichés of a John Wayne picture, he still falls back on a Hollywood style of story -telling, complete with silhouetted figures against a dying sunlight and uplifting John Williams music on the soundtrack. As surprising as this may sound, I found myself half-wishing that John Wayne had played Captain Miller instead of Tom Hanks. I can picture the Duke shouting Hanks' line, "We're not here to do the decent thing, we're here to follow orders!" Wayne, by his booming presence, would have automatically filled up the general blankness of the character. Hanks' Miller doesn't seem interesting enough to justify the pool his men are running (they're wondering what his occupation in civilian life was.) "Saving Private Ryan" seems to suffer from Spielberg's desire to make it the definitive World War II movie (just as "Schindler's List" seemed to suffer from a desire to be the definite Holocaust drama). The scene in which General George C. Marshall makes his little speech in favor of saving Private Ryan is very touching, but I couldn't help wondering: If the U.S. Army is that concerned about the last of the Ryan brothers, why were all four of them sent to the front lines in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great portrayal of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the greatest portrayal of war on film that I have ever seen, mainly because it works like a documentary during the battle scenes. It was as close to the action as possible for the viewer, and for that, it is great. Everyone should see it just to experience it.However, I do have some complaints. There are several instances that were far too manipulative on Spielberg's part. The little girl and her family? The German soldier/prisoner incident? The aging veteran? All very questionable and probably not necessary. The sheer content of the picture was moving enough, why elaborate on other things of much lighter substance ?This deserves a nomination for best picture, but if The Thin Red Line lives up to expectations, I'd hesitate to give it a win. Unforgettable all the same though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This should not win the Oscars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should not sweep the Oscars, even though it will. The only awards this movie should get are best sound, best sound efects editing, and best make-up. People are so crazy about how this film is a groundbreaking achivemnet for humankind. This film does not have a new message. It's message is, basically : War is not good. Gee, really...You think? Lots have people have done war movies, and a large amount of them were better than Spielberg's. And people are saying that Saving Private Ryan is the most gritty and scary war films ever made. It is not even close to attaining that title (Das Boot is my choice) The Truman Show is the film that should win them all. It had original ideas and it dealt with them in an original way. It had a message that nobody had fully confronted yet. Saving Private Ryan is only my second favorite film of the year, and is not even close to being as good as The Truman Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously this film has the best war sequences ever made and blah, blah, blah. This does not make up for the fact that plot, character development, and any sense of originality were left out of the picture. Don't get me wrong, I think it was a stunning movie, and I would recomend it to anyone, I just think people can get to excited over something too fast. Also, the opening and closing scenes with the old man were the biggest waste of my theatre time in years. Not since "Twister" have I felt so used. The design and realism was incredible, and I left the theatre feeling very moved, and it lasted for A WHILE. But best war movie ever made? "Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now" were not as graphic, but I will NEVER forget the feeling I had when I first saw these war films. I am very interested in checking out "Thin Red Line" later this year to see how it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The war film that brings the audience *into* the war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first suggestion to anyone who has not yet seen this movie is GO. Don't wait for video; don't think it can't be half as good as they say; don't use the 1,000 different procrastinator's excuses. Just GO. Saving Private Ryan is every bit as moving, amazing and harrowing as you've heard...and then some. More importantly, Saving Private Ryan gives the audience just a taste of what it must have been like to be a soldier in what is called the Last Great War, and in the process shows you, in no uncertain terms, that *no* war is great. Saving Private Ryan also made me realize just what a sacrifice the men who fought World War II made to ensure that you and I and everyone that came after lived in a safer, freer world.Yes, the 25-minute Omaha Beach scene is terrifying, intense and graphic, but stick it out. You'll see some incredible feats, made more so by the realization that real men actually *did* these things. A small, non -spoiler example: one of the medics, with his corpsman, going down a line of wounded soldiers; bullets are flying all around, men are still being killed and maimed in horrific ways, yet here is this medic, performing triage, knowing at any second one of those bullets might find him.Spielberg, and especially Tom Hanks, bring you *into* the war; you truly see that, to the soldier, war isn't about opposing ideologies, but about accomplishing your mission, and getting your guys, and hopefully yourself, home in one piece. That's it. Not patriotism, at least not on the front lines; not idealism; just survival and duty, and loyalty to your guys. And Hanks shows you how, in the midst of loss and destruction and almost intolerable inhumanity, a man can still do his duty; more than any other actor in the film, Hanks shows you how a man, normal and mild-mannered back home, finds the strength to do what is asked, and continue doing it, until the task is complete.For me, Tom Hanks makes this movie. Many reviews have pointed out that Tom Hanks delivers another of the brilliant, emotionally three-dimensional performances we, as one critic put it, have come to expect of him. Tom Hanks' work in Private Ryan is so subtle, so real, yet so breathtakingly beautiful that the Academy will have taken leave of its collective senses if they *don't* give him a third Oscar. In my humble opinion, Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of this generation. You can keep your DeNiros, your Hoffmans, your Pacinos; give me Tom Hanks any day.It's a powerful movie; not perfect, but very nearly so. Don't deny yourself the experience of seeing Saving Private Ryan on the big screen. It's a trip worth making.</fullReview>

Not "Platoon" "Apocalypse Now" "Full Metal Jacket" "The Deer Hunter" can prepare you for this experience.  8 for 1. What an odd math equation. Why would eight men risks their lives for the sake of 1? This is Spielberg's question posed and answer it, he does. Tom Hanks is the reclusive Capt.

I don't want to explain what happens, because I want you to see the movie yourself.  No stomach for violence? I hope you can survive the first 24 minutes, the battle scene that will go down in the history as the greatest invasion ever filmed. It is the infamous D-Day Invasion, the Invasion of Normandy to others. Hell on Earth, to those who were there. I don't know if this is accurate and all, I'm 15, the closest thing to war I ever had was my Grandfather, so I don't know firsthand. But I leave it to Spielberg to tell the truth. It is a film, not about war, but men in war. The feelings of love, loss, courage and cowardice. All of it is interwoven into, well, the best film of the year and one of the greatest of all time. It is so beautiful and horrific, it wrenches your soul and you know that, hey, this actually happened. Men fought and men died. I have a new found honor for those who fought to keep me free and those who died trying. I only have a thousand words, so I should keep it brief. Spielberg has crafted a gory, yet beautiful, gritty, yet polished film. This will not be the film he is not remembered for, that was "Schindler's List". But this will certainly put him the legends books at Hollywood.  Of 4 stars: * * * *  "In the last great invasion, of the last great war, the hardest mission for eight men, was saving...

Most other movies have bombs and bullets killing people people in clean, neat ways. SPR doesn't. It's real, and as a viewer, it is very believable, and that is what gave it the emotional impact. In the middle, the movie drags some, never engaging me as much as Schindler's List did.

		<shortDescription>Private Ryan is intensely stirring, but it doesn't follow through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've heard reams of praise for Private Ryan. We're sure to see it win some major film awards in the coming months. Let's be honest, this film is well above average for a Hollywood product. Spielberg is a bona-fide talent and has proved that he can make serious, engaging films.Still, as much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, I left the theater feeling strangely unfulfilled. The story of the D-Day invasion and dubiously honorable search for one soldier is very well told and pays homage to the finest and most brutally honest WWII films ever made. Spielberg's smartest decision in this film was in using John Williams' score rather sparingly. The sight of soldiers jumping off the gunboats to their immediate deaths is horrific, and we don't need music to remind us. The story plays itself out very naturally. Not every gruesome event happens for a reason; we're reminded that war has no immediately discernible logic. Even the recognizable stars aren't spared the horrors of war.However, this film is bookmarked by an opening and closing sequence in the present day that, while well-intentioned, is more of a distraction than anything else. The apparent message is that not a minute of your life should be taken for granted when others make great sacrifices for you.We study history so that we may appreciate our existence, not so we can plug into mindless entertainment. When will Hollywood realize this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best WWII movie thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many people say that Vietnam was the most horrific and vicious war of this century. I always said, yes, it was bad, but no worse than any other war. I think that this film proves my point better than any book or essay.I've always been fascinated by World War II, and have enjoyed many of Steven Spielberg's WWII-era films as a result. After seeing this one, I see every other WWII movie before it as almost an insult to the reality of war. But I don't think a true account of what it was like on Normandy beach would be possible before now.Unlike other war movies, this one shows a larger picture, as seen from the perspective of individual soldiers. The characters in Saving Private Ryan are certainly the emphasis of the story, but Spielberg does not shy away from showing us the countless others they meet along the way. ALL of the characters in the movie are believable, not exaggerated as in many other war movies.Anyone who "enjoys" the battle scenes is so completely desensitized to violence that even this movie won't be able to resensitize you. Anyone who says the movie's story is weak or that Spielberg's direction is a problem has either not seen the movie at all or made their minds up before they saw it. To fully appreciate Saving Private Ryan, one must put themselves in the soldiers' shoes, which in this case is made excruciatingly easy.This film's only weak point is far stronger than most American WWII movies. The German's perspective is represented here, but could still be better stated. I suggest Das Boot as a movie which shows what the enemy really thought about the war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backgrounds Provide Motivation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed with both of Spielberg's Second World War movies: Schindler 's List and Saving Private Ryan. They created a level of realism that evoked an emotional level very much like grief that one experiences through family loss. Spielberg's development of the character Captain Miller was effective in symbolizing the general level of support for the war--teacher turned warrior. Similarly, Oskar Schindler represented higher values in a chaotic setting. Spielberg is such a force that one would have to go back to D.W. Griffith to find a director who was the star of the picture. As a Baby Boomer who grew up on war "entertainment" I can tell you that most war movies did little more that heighten my hormonal levels. Both Schindler's and Pvt. Ryan made me cry--heaving types of release that one would assume would be reserved for family losses. Now that is empathy by the viewer! I was impressed by the way that Spielberg recreated battle scenes, rather than inventing them. I am sure that the veterans had a sense of flashback, whereas the uninitiated were merely horrified. Spielberg gave the viewer the opportunity to identify with the struggles and sacrifices of veterans; an opportunity to attempt to understand the trauma suffered by all combat veterans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts and ends with a sun-bleached American flag whipping in the wind. Between these images we see several intense and very believable battle sequences. We get a good glimpse into the nightmares of every modern war veteran. But this movie isn't all just battle scenes, gore, and death. It has characters we can associate with. The normal guys who find themselves in extraordinary situations -- not action heroes or superstars who fit right in to battle scenes. Their fear expressed in high-speed stuttered camera techniques (everything comes into sharp focus.) We watch one man's, Cap'n Miller, descent into insanity. We watch eight men fight for a simple idea of military etiquette. We watch hate grow in both our heroes and the Germans'. We watch poetic injustice. This movie questions the cost of war. The cost of human lives and ideas, and it recalls a memory that in a couple of decades will be lost forever in the graves of ancient men. This is not just another war flick. It's deep, meaningful, intellectual, and real. And as a film student, I'd be ashamed should this impressive and powerful film not receive both popular and awards recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will make you fully realize the horrors of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a 17-year-old, I find the thought of war particularly harrowing, since I and my peers would be eligible for the draft if war were to break out. If it did, I honestly don't know what I'd do; but the action of going into the middle of the battlefield surrounded by bullets and men with blood streaming out of their bodies seems too terrible to contemplate. And it's all too easy to intellectualize war, particularly for those who are well beyond draftable age, saying, "Yeah, it would be terrible, but it's your duty as a citizen." That's not considering the complete picture; people who have such a simple answer can't possibly understand what being in a war would be like . "Saving Private Ryan," in all its brutal realism, should make people think twice before saying something like that so nonchalantly. Because the fact is, people go into battles and get their limbs blown off, get shot five times in the chest, or, worst of all, get hit where they don't die immediately and then just have to lie there, whimpering that they're going to die. People who haven't been in war can say it's terrible but if you're called, it's your duty; but I imagine that most people who have experienced war will only tell you that it's terrible. Many things have already been said about this movie that I needn't repeat. It definitely was an outstanding motion picture. But there is one thing I want to say about those who are so intent on complaining about the bookend scenes being too sentimental, and that's this : the sentimentality wasn't the point. At least not in my mind. At the end , when the old man is looking at the grave of one of his comrades, his wife walks up to him. She looks at the grave too, but her expression is blank, and her gaze quickly away from the grave to the old man's face, a face that has written on it the knowledge of what the man whose name is on the cross did for him. When I saw those two people, I gasped, because I realized that the two of them were on opposite sides of the spectrum of experience and were therefore seeing completely different things embodied by the cross- to the woman, the cross was simply the life of her husband; he was what mattered to her. But to the man, the cross was everything the war had been- the terrible fighting, the killing, the sacrifice that the man in the ground beneath him had given for him. That was what I got out of the "bookend" scenes, and I found that moment to be one of the most poignant moments of the entire movie."Schindler's List" transcended the form of cinema; it didn't even feel like a movie, or a documentary, for that matter, it was so well-done. "Saving Private Ryan" still struck me as a movie (save the first scene, which really puts you there), but it was, nevertheless, one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie, "Saving Private Ryan", deeply touched me. I have seen it three times and each time powerful feelings were evoked. I encourage everyone to see the movie, not for entertainment purposes, but out of respect for the servicemen who gave their lives. At only 23 years old, I have found a new appreciation for what those sevicemen did and what they stood for. I have visited the D-Day Museum in Normandy and the American Cemetary. Ironically, I have never been to a more peaceful place than Omaha Beach, walking through the bombed out bunkers. I felt a presence of what it was like to be there on that day in June. I hope that others, especially people not old enough to have lived through a war, can begin to appreciate what the American military stands for and what they protect. The freedom that they continue to defend is something that should never be taken for granted. I would like to thank Mr. Speilberg for "Saving Private Ryan" and for "Schindler's List", another emotionally touching film about the 1940's massacre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening, twenty minute scene offered me more than most of the rest of the film. It should have been more heavily edited, and the tricks that Spielberg has used so successfully in his past blockbusters could (and should) have been foregone in this picture. I have never given him much credit as a filmmaker beyond his ability to make films that lots of people like to see: which is worth something, it's true, but with the exception of Schindler's List I haven't found much to look at in his films and even less to pay attention to in terms of plot. Most of his films, SPR even, are the basic western prototype, with good guy v. bad guy. That can be fine, too. But I really wanted him to convince me of something, to move me, with this film. I was heavily persuaded by the wonderful interview piece by Hendrik Hertzberg in The New Yorker a few weeks ago into believing that Spielberg was trying to make a smart, difficult, realistic film, and to some degree he did. But where was the swearing? Is it true that only white men fought in WWII? Did soldiers really, even in the heat of battle, immediately dive into the pockets of their dead buddies for the "Dear Mom and Dad" letters? I don't know the answers to these questions yet. I think this is an important film. I think many scenes were filmed very well. I think it would be a very meaningful and intense film for a WWII veteran: for those, like me, who did not fight in that war, I think it missed something to make me feel invested, to really move me. I'm not an overly-callous or violent person, nor do I in any way *enjoy*--that is, take real pleasure in--heavy -duty war scenes, yet I never had to look away: and it seems that I should have felt compelled to do that at some point, and I went into this film expecting that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been fascinated about the subject of WWII, having read many books on the subject. Until now, however, it was always somewhat distant and surreal. I looked at photographs of the war and thought how amazing that such an event could have ever taken place, and how I admire and respect the men who gave their lives in defense of freedom. A man I know was recently decorated by the President for his part in D-Day and I asked him if he had been scared at the time. He told me that the truth of the matter was that all of the kids in the boats were really unaware of the enormity of the whole situation and that it was just something that had to be done. After having seen SPR, I understand what he meant and why it is that when I ask other WWII survivors about their experiences, they mostly generalize, not really wanting to talk about it. The things they must have seen cannot be conveyed in mere words. Steven Spielberg has done a tremendous job in helping me to see the truth about WWII. The next Oscars will be a titanic night for Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

WWII wasn't all happiness and brotherhood among men. There was a war going on as well. Tom Hanks easily earned his third oscar with his role as the captain of a unit on a mission to find Priv. James Ryan. Speilberg easily gets an Oscar as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with my dad and as we left after the credits everybody was still there and it was silent. It is hard to describe this movie because it was so visual you really have to see it to get the full impact so I am describing this for lack of better words. It was just like being in war and it just shows how bad it really is. It really opened my eyes to war. I think that the last lines of the movie will go down in history. In that theater if you werent crying yet that line would put you over the edge, I made one of my friends cry just telling them that line. This movie is good for all the kids of my generation who think all this viloence is funny and cool, no I am not saying that all kids think that but a lot do so do not be offended by this statement. This was the best movie I have ever seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been fascinated about the subject of WWII, having read many books on the subject. Until now, however, it was always somewhat distant and surreal. I looked at photographs of the war and thought how amazing that such an event could have ever taken place, and how I admire and respect the men who gave their lives in defense of freedom. A man I know was recently decorated by the President for his part in D-Day and I asked him if he had been scared at the time. He told me that the truth of the matter was that all of the kids in the boats were really unaware of the enormity of the whole situation and that it was just something that had to be done. After having seen SPR, I understand what he meant and why it is that when I ask other WWII survivors about their experiences, they mostly generalize, not really wanting to talk about it. The things they must have seen cannot be conveyed in mere words. Steven Spielberg has done a tremendous job in helping me to see the truth about WWII. The next Oscars will be a titanic night for Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was riveting! It's gotta be oscar-bound! I want to see it again. I can't begin to describe what you feel when you are in that theater,..when the movie is over and you are just kind of sitting there,...it's like you are in awe,...you know that stuff like this actually happened,..that this is the most true to life image of this war to date and you can't believe that it actually happened this way in such graphic detail. Throughout the movie you sit there and you watch the soldiers get killed one after another in many different ways and you want to look away,..but you don't,.. because you know that this is a part of your history,...you have to watch because if you don't it's like hiding from the truth. this movie really shows us that war is hell. the intricate camera angles and Speilberg's genius in this film make you feel like you are in the crossfire. And in the 28 or so minutes that you sit through the Omaha beach invasion all you want is for it to be over already. I felt like running out of the theater just to escape it's brutality,.. but i couldn't tear myself away. You begin to get to know the soldiers and you feel their bond as they set out to find the only remaining Ryan brother out of four. You accompany them on this journey into the depths of the war and at some points all you want to do is cry. If you haven't seen it i've done my best here to not ruin it for you so you can go see it yourself. It's well worth it and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One person said characters were static. I thought, given the scope of the film, that the characters were developed very subtly - for example, the scene in which the medic was rewriting the bloody letter home written by the first man killed while confessing a wish that he had not pretended to be sleeping so his Mom wouldn't chat it up with him. Very real. The camera work was intended to make you feel "first person" intensity, which it did. Try running with 40+ pounds strapped to your back, with a helmet bobbing around on your head, while trying to find some cover. The camera caught exactly what you would "see". It took some visual adjustment , but was part and parcel to what made this movie effective. I'm not trying to find flaws. I agree that we should - SHOULD - not needa reminder that war is hell, or that, if we do need it there is something wrong with us. I think that we DO need it. We do seem to forget what it meant that these soldiers took a bullet to gain a beach. There isn't anything "wrong" with us. We just get complacent. We should remind ourselves any time we are about to romanticize war. We need to do it. Memorial Day and Veterans Day do not just mean long weekends. They stand for something. And we need to say, "Thank you," not only to the people who sacrificed their lives, but to those who survived as well, and helped to do some part to put an end to it. We should do that by taking up the most difficult burden ever laid on a human being - the one put in the end: "Make it all count for something". How could anyone live up to that? The message of this movie? Do your best to do exactly THAT with your own life. Make it count.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of D-Day, a picture comes to mind. In Life magazine, Robert Capa the famous war photographer, had a picture he took at D-Day. He landed with the men at Normandy on June 6, 1944 and was nearly killed. "The water was very cold, and the beach still more than 100 yards away. The bullets tore holes in the water around me, and I made for the nearest steal obstacle...it was still very early and very gray for good pictures, but the gray water and gray sky made the little men, dodging under the surrealistic designs of Hitler's anti-invasion braintrust, very effective.", he said later of the day. The photograph is very grainy. You can see the steal barricades and a soldier, blurry in the foreground gritting his teeth, swimming towards his destiny. Clearly Capa was afraid while taking the picture. Speilberg has filled in Capa's grainy, blurry photo for me. I can see Speilberg's Capt. Miller scared, crawling towards his destiny; the destiny of many. I always thought that these men were brave, but it seems more real knowing the specific horrors the endured. It is no longer a blurred and grainy Life Magazine photo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was a very good film. I loved the gritty realism of WWII that Spielberg depicted. The performances were all outstanding. A few complaints:1) Lack of character development. With the exception of maybe Hanks' character, we learn next to nothing about these men. The characterization has little depth.2) The sound effects drown out dialogue. I don't know if it was intended or not but it was very annoying.3) A little unrealistic towards the end. I've heard it was based on a true story so maybe I'm wrong here, but...Overall, I was a little disappointed, and I thought Schindler's List was far better and remains Spielberg's best film.</fullReview>

Watching the movie, and afterward, I realized that "Saving Private Ryan" is much more than a good movie; It was like I was sent back to Normandy in a time machine to witness the actual event. My stomach was churning, and I experienced for the first time ever in a movie, feelings of fear and pride. I actually had a felling in my stomach like I was getting ready to fight in a battle. When you hear the Nazi tanks coming closer to you, it makes you feel the same way. I felt proud to be an American watching this movie, and every moment since. "Private Ryan" is an absolute must for everyone, but bring some kleenex and a solid stomach for the experience.</fullReview>

If I never understood before, I now understand why the veterans who came back from the wars were so changed, and so different. Possibly the most gut -wrenching scene (besides the ending, which I won't spoil) was the scene when the German soldier was begging the Americans not to kill him and singing American songs. Anyone who says this movie dragged in the middle or was too sentimental or too mushy or too graphic obviously is not in touch with their emotions.

		<fullReview>Well, it has been a week since I saw this movie, and six days since I posted my last comment on it (see August 2nd). And, to tell the truth, not a whole lot has changed in the impact this film has had.Certainly, the images have started to fade, and I can't remember every single nuance and camera angle any more. The names of the characters have all but faded from my brain. Much of the movie has gone the way of movies in the past -- gone to make way for the every day hum-drum of life.However, there is one thing that hasn't faded -- the distinct feeling of respect for life, and perhaps even a newfound appreciation for it. This movie is powerful. I'm not saying that as someone who gets easily moved by movies but as someone who watched this epic film, and hasn't been quite the same since.I can no longer take life for granted. I attempted to watch "Volcano" the other day, and couldn't finish it because the death scenes disgusted me -- they seemed too contrived for ratings -- and these are the same scenes that I had no problem with not too long ago.For those who don't believe that this movie is important, or think that it too is contrived: you're the reason this film was made, and the reason that others gave their lives."I may not agree with your opinion, but will defend with my life your right to have it"Anyway, I thought it would be nice for someone more than two days removed from this film to show that, if you allow yourself to take more from this film than "war is hell", it will affect you for some time to come.-CR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always considered myself a fan of Speilberg. He has consistently turned out fine, entertaining work. As a serious filmmaker he excels. As a director of slick entertainments, he also excels. Unlike many who believe Schindlers List has been his masterpiece, I feel ET was a greater acheivement. As good as Schindlers List was (and it was very, very good), its impact seemed at times forced. All this aside, nothing could prepare me for Saving Private Ryan. The film is not the work of a great director, it is the work of a world-class artist. It is stunning. It is devastating. It works where it should not work. It works where you do not want it to work. It is a simple war film. It is an intellectual challenge. It is cold and distant. It is raw and emotional. I have never seen or experienced anything quite like it before. The only film I can remember reacting to in such a way is Pasolinis great (and repugnant) film Salo. Both are kicks in the gut. Both (and I'm sure there are not many admirers of Salo out there) are cries from the depths that eventually by their ends not only expose human evils, but also depict hope and dignity. I cannot say enough for Saving Private Ryan. All I can say is experience it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this as brief as I can due length of this page and to the overwhelming responses to this truly great American movie that, now that I've experienced it, I plan never to watch again.My review is broken into two separate parts. Part one is for those who have difficulty with violence, blood, and gore: Don't see it-----you'll be getting over it for days. Possibly weeks.Part two is for those who can handle violence, blood, and gore: See it. You'll have the same problem getting over it, though.This is a movie that locks the name of Steven Spielberg into cinematic history forever. The thing that makes this movie like no other ever made is that it makes us believe, without a doubt, what it is to be in the hell that is war. The shocking scenes of violence and horrific combat combined with sound editing that actually makes you want to take cover under your seat will haunt the hardest of souls long after you step out of the darkened theater and back into the normal world. A world you will be thankful to have when you stop to think that 98% of what you just saw *actually happened* to thousands of American soldiers. The story told here is one of ultimate sacrifice and deepest loss. This is not a flag-waving movie, nor is it "Kelly's Heroes". This is the truth about D-Day, the truth about those who were unfortunate enough to be there, and those who were fortunate enough to make it back alive.</fullReview>

Although that was one of the best parts of the movie there is still one thing that still sticks out in my mind even though i saw the movie a week ago. That is the part in which the german is stabbing one of the americans and constantly saying "shhh". There is not a moment that goes by that I don't think about that part.

		<fullReview>I found "Saving Private Ryan" rather elementary. Yes, it makes me proud to be an American, but many movies do that ("Primary Colors" is a better, and more recent, standout), and Spielberg seems to be interpreting the horrors of war while rarely showing the human element behind it, and consequently dulls the impact of the message: War is very, very bad. The film lacks intelligence, and perhaps lacks a soul as well, despite its patriotic fervor. Tom Hanks is quite good, though, as the tortured captain whose face is a mask of quiet despair. In one scene, where the soldiers under his command want to shoot a German prisoner, Hanks turns away, trying to become blind to it all. His performance and the dazzling cinematography make up for a so-so story and a script containing approximately fifteen coherent sentences (still five or six more than "Close Encounters," though ).</fullReview>

I don't know how Steven Spielberg depicted such a raw, and vivid portrayal of the effects of war, but he did a tremendous job. My hat goes off to him and the many actors, and extras who took me into battle with them. Even though I felt like I was at war myself, I can't seem to shake the thought that this movie was only scratching the surface of actually being there. How these men watched their friends get killed each day, smelled blood and rotting bodies, lived with the fear that they would be next and never go home, or worse, live with the guilt that they had survived, only a true veteran will ever know. For many years I have taken my freedom for granted. Memorial Day was a day off from work, and a day of picnics. Thanks to this movie, I will never see it this way again. This movie has left myself and millions of other people with a whole new outlook on the way we view our veterans, and those who lost their lives at war. I thank them all from the bottom of my heart for what we have today, and for the freedom that many of us have taken for granted. I also thank Saving Private Ryan, for the rude awakening that we all needed. I believe that everyone who sees it, will never be the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan forced me to respect Steven Spielberg again. While I often found little depth to his other films, with the obvious exception of Schindler's List, his work on this was absolutely magnificent. The thing I liked most about the process behind SPR was the amount of teamwork involved -- Janusz Kaminski's photography is the best I've ever seen, for not only was it technically brilliant, but it also made me feel as though I was in Normandy, on the beach, and amidst the dying. The same goes for the sound and production design, for it did what was needed most: put the viewer in the action. Everyone associated with this picture should be proud of their work. The only fictional war story better than this in my opinion would be Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.I doubt I'll see a movie more powerful than Saving Private Ryan, even if the rumors about The Thin Red Line are true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speilberg and Hanks deliver pure magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is normal to believe that once a director makes a film like SCHINDLER'S LIST, he will struggle for the rest of his career trying to live up to it; not Steven Speilberg. I cannot describe with words the power of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. All I can say is that its overall execution is simply perfect. The depiction of the D-Day invasion is more than worth the price of admission and should receive special recognition as the greatest scene ever filmed. It is completely horrifying, as it should be; editing, cinematography and sound have been given a new standard with this terrifying sequence. That scene, along with the rest of the movie, is ultimately a tribute to its director. In Speilberg's hands, the level of drama reaches unchartered territory. Be patient, I'm only getting started.The screenplay totally delivers. Robert Rodat's characterizations are subtle, yet powerful, and when someone dies, your sorrow lingers because you feel you have truly known them for that brief period of time. This is a tribute to the actors as well.Unfortunately, fifty years from now Tom Hanks will probably be remembered as "the guy who played Forrest Gump"; he shouldn't be. For me, Hanks will always be Captain John Miller -- a decent man with a knack for leadership, a man who truly loves each boy he leads into battle, a man who is quietly more terrified than any of those boys. The genius in Hanks' performance lies not in his portrayal of an Army Captain, but in the way he makes us believe that John Miller truly IS a Captain. A word of advice to the Academy: DON'T BE POLITICAL! THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH SOMEONE WINNING THREE OSCARS IN SIX YEARS! Not if he/she deserves it, as Hanks does.The supporting cast is also phenomenal. Matt Damon brings integrity and honor to the role of Private James Ryan; you feel that Miller's squad has made the right decision in doing their best to find him. Barry Pepper is terrific as Private Jackson, the religious sniper from Tennessee. Edward Burns hits the bullseye as Private Reiben, the cynical chatterbox from Brooklyn. The most solid supporting performance, however, is given by one of Hollywood's most underrated actors -- Tom Sizemore. His portrayal of the loyal Sergeant Horvath is amazing and, at its core, truly heartfelt. I pray he gets at least a nomination, if not a little golden boy of his own next March.Next March is a fitting topic to conclude on. Be prepared to hear "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN", "Steven Speilberg", "Tom Hanks" etc. quite frequently at the 71st Annual Academy Awards. With this stunning epic, those phrases deserve to be all over the little white envelopes as they are torn open next year.</fullReview>

Spielberg pulls no punches in his telling of the tale of 8 brave men on a mission to save a mothers last remaining son. Hanks delivers a performance that is sure to bring him his third Best Actor Oscar, and Tom Sizemore is superb as a hard-nosed sergeant that stands at Hanks' side. Powerful performances and incredible special effects make this one of the best films of Steven Spielberg's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many others have remarked, the first 25 minutes of this film are intense, brutal, and painful to endure. I agree there. However, I disagree with some that the "shaky" cam during the Normandy sequence was jarring or headache -inducing. Completely drawn in, never once did I stop to think I was viewing the gore and horror through a lens. I was there. And I didn't want to be. I closed my eyes during some scenes, but I couldn't close my ears, I couldn't escape - the bullets kept on flying.How could anyone survive something like that and go on to lead a semi-normal life? I couldn't even watch "White Christmas" after seeing this movie; at the first sight of a WWII jeep, I wanted to cry. What is it like for someone who was really there?Good movies simultaneously make us think and feel, and this one did that for me. I only wish Spielberg would have cast unknowns in all of the parts; seeing Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in the midst of this ultra-realistic violence reminded me it was still Hollywood pulling the strings. Most people have commented that Hanks should win an Oscar, but I think that would be unfair to the rest of the cast. The grueling process they had to endure, the dark heart of humanity each actor had to face to make such a film, makes them all deserving of recognition. Hanks played Captain Miller with honesty and grace, but I don't think he necessarily outshone the performances of Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, or Jeremy Davies.Analyzing the plot or the characters is missing the point. If the "Jew" had been the sniper from Tennesee or the "Brooklynite" had been the combat-shy translator, most of you would still complain about stereotypes. People say they didn't care about the characters because they weren't "interesting." Is everyone you meet on the street incredibly "interesting"? I doubt it. The point isn't to care or not care when they get killed, but to realize this really happened, to all kinds of men and women that we may find boring or typical in civilian life, but who put their lives on the line.Some say they didn't need the "war is hell" message crammed down their throats. Well, that's great for you, but if "everyone" knows war is bad, death is bad, why is it still so rampant in our society? War is always happening somewhere. This movie shows that not only is war hell, but the death of one man is just as tragic. If everyone really did know this, we wouldn't have gang wars, drive-by shootings, or terrorist bombings. Everyone NEEDS to know this. And if a gut-wrenching movie will drive this message home to those people, then I'm all for it.And though this is getting too long already, I have to say one more thing: many of you didn't care for the apparent sappiness of the "bookend" scenes of the old man at the cemetery. Why does everyone have such an aversion to sentiment? I say things in my every day life that, if someone were to make them movie dialogue, would sound hopelessly cheesy. But that doesn't make them any less true or real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan left me speechless. To say it was a quality film does not do it justice. It's a shame that there will be an inevitable posse of people who don't like this film. (I hate those achingly typical individuals who feel a need to buck the majority.) Admittedly, it's not a film for everyone, but no one can say that it wasn't a well-done motion picture. The actors did a stellar job of bringing what could have easily been stereotypical soldiers to life. Giovanni Ribisi was particularly riveting (in my humble opinion). Still, I have one itty-bitty bone to pick with this film. It's a shame that Spielberg had to frame his incredible WWII story with a painfully contrived modern-day scene. I dealt with the beginning, but the end was positively gooey with cheese. What happened during WWII was the story, not what happened after. Other than that, I commend Spielberg for creating such an affecting motion picture (and for having the courage to cast such brilliant, yet relatively unknown, actors).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is "realism" art worth mentioning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said in homage of this movie. Realistic. Important. Devastating. A Masterpiece. An instant Classic. Brilliant. But how much of this is hype? Is this an example of the mainstream press bouncing off of itself to create an event? Is this really the first movie to show what war is really like? Who knows, really. Well, people all around the world know exactly what war is like. There's the World War, Korea and Vietnam veterans here in the U.S.. The Vietnamese, Korean, Laotian, Chechnyan, Iraqi, Isrealite, Palestinian, Saudi Arabian, French, German, etc. etc. civilians and soldiers alive during the conflicts in their countries that either have happened or are happening right now. Or, in other words, perhaps there are more people alive who know exactly what war is like than you can shake a stick at. Maybe even more people than live in the U.S.. Maybe more than will ever plunk down cash to see this "visceral" fantasy, this money making effort(don't forget just how much Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and thousands of other folk whose lives depend upon the success of their entertainment ventures are going to make from this particular one) that depends, partially, upon our buying in to the acceptability(even the goodness) of killing people with guns (ie. as German soldier is sitting astride one of our heroes, about to run him through with a knife, tell me that you don't want to wrest the gun out of the "ineffectual" intellectual who lies frozen just around the corner, that you don't want to take that gun and shoot the heck out of the soldier killing our friend). Oh my yes.I personally haven't lived through a war. I don't know what it is like. I can't, however, imagine that it was anything like the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. And it certainly wasn't anything like the next overly romanticized two hours. It might have been hard to watch, sure, but I could just close my eyes, think these are all actors, and lo and behold, three hours later I'm thinking about which restaurant to eat at. I wouldn't try to think that my experience with this movie would let me talk, with any sophistication, with someone who has lived through an armed conflict, much less imagine that I, in any way, was left with an experience that threw my very notion of myself into turmoil. Saving Private Ryan is just a movie. Perhaps it was a more "realistic" effort than has been previously made. But all you need to do is throw a lot of money at something, take into account an audience more prepared for on screen violence, and hire enough people who are decently skilled at what they do, and poof, you have Saving Private Ryan. Sure it is finely crafted. Certainly the acting is decent, the lines aren't completely horrible, and the cinematography doesn't intrude on the experience. But it is still just a movie. If we, as a nation, need something like Saving Private Ryan to realize that war is horrible, that people die way too quickly and without reason, then I think this means that there is something wrong with us. There are people living situations out there that are far worse than anything we feel when we are in our air conditioned theatres, and I think that it is a bit condescending of us to think that we understand anything about war just because we watched this movie.It is a fine movie. Not exceptional. Not the best of the year. Not even as interesting as Forest Gump. But a fine movie that is worth seeing. Sure.</fullReview>

I have several veterans in my family and until yesterday I hadn't really though about all the sacrifices they made for our country. I always loved them and appreciated their service in WWII, Korea, Vietnam but it had always been a vague idea what their experience was like. I don't know anyone who was on the shores of Normandy on June 6, 1944 but I'd be surprised if SPR's depiction was significantly different. Until yesterday, Memorial Day was always just a 3-day weekend for me. I don't know if would have been brave enough to handle the carnage I saw yesterday. I know I hope I never have to find out. Some jerk sitting by me was laughing through the movie and calling characters wimps, etc. I was unable to get over the irony of real people dying 50+ years ago to defend this idiot's right to see a movie depicting that struggle, but that's freedom and today, it's not just an untangible idea for me.

		<shortDescription>The truth is frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I'm pretty reluctant to see movies at a friend's recommendation- -they're so built up by the time I actually see them and I'm rather disappointed. However, there is no way that anyone can be prepared for the effects of this film, and I was certainly NOT disappointed. There is no way that anyone can accurately describe what this movie contains--the people it portrays, the senses and sounds it illustrates, and the emotions that it evokes. It is true that this film is frighteningly realistic; it's certainly not for the faint of heart. However, it is still only a film, and it delivers only a mere FRACTION of what our veterans experienced in the horrors of battle. This is one of the most horrifying yet fascinating and moving films that I have ever seen in my life.Saving Private Ryan is a very emotionally disturbing movie in terms of seeing the too real horrors of war on the silver screen because Hollywood is usually shiny, happy and perfect. In a way it's a bit ironic that something so horrible can appear in such compact form. It's not supposed to be real, and it's supposed to comfort us--isn't that what show business is about? This movie didn't do that. I almost became ill at some of the scenes. Merely sitting in an air-conditioned theatre with Dolby Digital Surround Sound watching this film was a bit nerve-racking, I must say. Imagine what real war must be like.While watching this movie, I felt sickened with paralyzing fear at the thoughts of war, being wounded, and dying in battle; in my mind's eye, I imagined my friends and I in the same situation. I simply couldn't fathom it, nor will I ever. I thank the powers that be for the men and women who did suffer through those battles. I thank the men and women who died for me, who died for my family, and who died for my friends. I thank the soldiers who serve today, who keep the rest of us safe so that we don't have to go into battle ourselves.It's films like Saving Private Ryan that give me a hundred times more respect for the armed forces. This is the film that gives us a glimpse of what we normally don't see or experience. This is the film everybody should see to gain insight into how lucky we civilians really are. This is the film about horrifying truth and enlightening respect and understanding. I guess that's what Hollywood can be about, too.Thank you,PiriyaMinister of Propaganda"And praise will come to those whose kindness leaves you without debt, and bends the shape of things to come that haven't happened yet." - Neil Finn</fullReview>

It's a week after I saw it , and I can still feel it in my gut.Makes you believe that those with 'war stories' probably were not anywhere near the real battlefields. Makes you believe that perhaps some of these people marching on July 4th are only representative of those who were really there.Makes you want to search these noble veterans out, and hug them and tell them 'thank-you' while they are still on this earth to thank.A movie that must been seen in the theater, to experience the sound as well as the sights....don't wait for the tape...you'd be missing out on something that will change you.This film cannot be over-exaggerated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What more is there to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the other reviews have pretty much summed up how great a movie this is. An instant classic. So I'll just add a few of my own thoughts. This is a must-see movie for a GOOD THEATRE with GOOD SOUND if you want to appreciate the battle sequences. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the battle with explosions all over the place and bullets whizzing by to the right and left. See it in the theatre with the best sound system possible. The D-Day sequence is one of the most brilliant movie sequences ever filmed. This is Spielberg's second greatest film: Schindler's List is still his most powerful. And this is probably one of the best, if not the best, war films. The only other one that comes close is Full Metal Jacket, which is more disturbing but not as comprehensive or as emotionally involving.

I think most 12-year old kids can handle this, and I think most boys 12 and up should see this film, since it will show them a glimpse of what real violence looks like, and maybe counteract the kind of stuff they see in Armageddon and video games.</fullReview>

However, I felt that at times it got a little overly sentimental. Especially at the very end. That is the only reason I refrained from giving it a perfect ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What more is there to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the other reviews have pretty much summed up how great a movie this is. An instant classic. So I'll just add a few of my own thoughts. This is a must-see movie for a GOOD THEATRE with GOOD SOUND if you want to appreciate the battle sequences. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the battle with explosions all over the place and bullets whizzing by to the right and left. See it in the theatre with the best sound system possible. The D-Day sequence is one of the most brilliant movie sequences ever filmed. This is Spielberg's second greatest film: Schindler's List is still his most powerful. And this is probably one of the best, if not the best, war films. The only other one that comes close is Full Metal Jacket, which is more disturbing but not as comprehensive or as emotionally involving. As far as the gore and violence, it's intense and brutal but is not nearly as bad as most gory horror films; it doesn't even come close to the Day of the Dead/Dawn of the Dead movies, but it's a completely different kind of violence. It's very real, not fantasy or comic-book violence.

And thats not counting the hundreds actually looking for him. So I for one find the plot very plausible...I have seen this movie twice now...and I must say that it is almost as hard to watch the second time, because you know whats coming and you can't stop it...For me at least this is almost the single greatest movie ever made...and I would like to thank my grandfather and all of those like him...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With out a doubt, Steven Spielberg has made a wonderful film with "Saving Private Ryan". It is a film that will change you. What I am having trouble with is, what many reviewers and the general public are seeing as the message of the film. It seems to me that they think the message of this film is "war is hell". I feel that does a disservice not only to this film, but to everyone of those soldiers. Of course war is hell, even those poor war movies covey that message.This is not a film about the horrors of war, it's about the sacrifices of war. Everyone of those grave markers that you see in Normandy represents a man or woman that sacrificed for us. Those sacrifices are all embodied in the character of Pvt. James Ryan and his family. Here is a family, and at the time a country, that forgave their own personal needs &amp; wants for those of the rest of the world. I believe that Speilberg is reminding us all of that sacrifice. Throughout the search for Pvt. Ryan we feel the ridiculous nature of the mission...(FUBAR). Here is a group of men that are sacrificing for one man and his family...us. When Capt. Phillips (Hanks) says to Ryan "earn it", Speilberg is saying it to us. Speilberg has "earned it" by the making of this film. Now the question is...what have the rest of us done?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say, that after reading some of the comments already posted, that i 'm amazed at how many people watched this movie and proceeded to critique it for its plot, enjoyability, etc. This, like Schindler's List, I think, is a movie to be absorbed rather than just plain watched. After watching this movie, i walked around for days with a kind of 'hangover' following me around...i was extremely moved by it. When somebody asks me what i thought of it, i say 'i think of it alot'. The battle sequences were absolutely horrific - and not because of the gore so much as the terrifying realization that these people (war veterans - both deceased and still alive) did this for their country...this horrible, traumatic experience,... most were very young and weren't expecting what they got. The terror must have been unlike anything my generation will ever know. Most people today feel panic stricken when the cable goes out just before their favorite episode of (fill in the blank), c'mon people ... take a hard look at this movie! TERRIFYING.

		<fullReview>One cannot see this movie without gaining a new appreciation for what World War II was like. Today's high-tech weapons make it easy to think real people are not involved or affected. It ain't like that at all. As a Vietnam Vet, I have vivid images of the horror of war but I still never fully appreciated the magnitude of loss that was faced by the young kids during D-Day. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for giving us a glimpse of what war is really like.Every year, each US citizen should see this film ... just before Veterans Day would be an excellent time. EVERY DAY we should reflect on the freedoms we have (and too often take for granted) and thank our veterans for the sacrifices that made freedom a reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of the best war films ever made simply because of its refusal to leave anything to the imagination. Nothing in this film is ambiguous, supported by vehement images of dismembering and dying. Whereas water drops hit the camera lens in another movie, blood splatters all over it in this one. The first 24 minutes are shot confusingly, using shaky, hand-held camera motion, ground level angle shots, numerous soldiers' POVS, as well as expert cinematography, creating a "news-reel" footage feel, gritty and fast. The war is chaotic and anything but fun. Dialogue in this movie is succint and to the point. Most of the characters exhibit their emotions merely by staring, emaciated, into the camera. Spielberg has created a graphic, candid image of war, something unparalled but highly controversial. Many people argue that some things should be left lightly without gratuity. To get the poignant purpose across, as well as many of the themes, however, Spielberg must let the audience identify with the characters, their fears and their insanity. The human stories are bettered by the horrific images. When they lose it, we don't question them. I don't question Spielberg either for taking a great story and providing it with vivid visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Saving Private Ryan for more or less one reason. It was supposed to be movie that portraits war as it really is and that it opposes war. However I was dissapointed.This movie is big rumble, but it fails to deliver. The battle sequences are horrific, but the end seems to be slapped on it for marketing purposes. This movie is about how horrific the war is for its first two thirds and then turns into romantic mush about how great it is to be a hero. The ending sequence has nothing to do with opposing the war.Also where is the human side of the other side? Where is the human side of Germans? Spielberg fails to show that the soldiers are the same no matter what side they fight. This is the true horror of war. That humans are fighting humans. And usually those whoe are fighting are not the ones that are in command. Where are all the generals and admirals and what not I ask? This movie was not supposed to be about the politics it was supposed to show the inhumanness of the war. And that it didn't.Other then that, of course Spielberg once again has outdone himself on the technical side. To shoot the whole movie without a tripod and make it look good too... well that takes a genius. Script, editing -- all is superb. A true Oscar movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Steven Spielberg is the greatest director alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the reason why Steven Spielberg is the greatest director alive, possibly the greatest director of all time. This film is about heroes, real heroes, and it is something that EVERY American should see.You look at an old man and see just an old man-- but how do you know what this old man has done in his life? What he's seen and done? "Saving Private Ryan" caused me to stop and think about that. It caused me to stop and consider the sacrifices young American men have made throughout this nation's history. Sacrifices many of the men in my own family have made. This is no John Wayne war film. The heroes of this movie were young men who were there to do a job. They were scared to death. They screamed and prayed and cried for their mothers. This film brings home (as best as any film can) the absolute horror and carnage of war and the very human way people react to such a nightmare. They were unwilling heroes, just like every other dogface who went to war in real life.Mr. Spielberg has made the best war movie ever to hit the theaters, and the actors-- all of them-- were outstanding. But let this film remind you of the real men who fought for us in real battles. This film is a tribute to them, and I don't think Mr. Spielberg will disagree with that statement. The film is gory and loud and frightening-- and it should be. Just remember, our fathers and grandfathers were there. Think about that the next time you see an old man doddering down the street. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was probably the most graphic War Epic I've seen. Speilburg's camera-work made you feel like you were actually in the battle, looking around at everything that's going on. When I walked into the theater, I remember my dad telling me "Remember, you don't have to look at the gore if you dont' want." But I sucked it up, I've lived through watching 5,000,000 blood shed hollywood epics, I can watch this i thought to myself, but in the first scene at D-day, I was basicly in tears, the thing that bothered me wasn't the blood, but it was how these men had to die, you see how they died, one man's stomach and intistine was all over and out of his stomach crying "MOM!!" I felt sorry for these people, in school when we talked about World War II, we thought of it as, "Ya, it was bad." But I think Private Ryan actually grips you, it even scares you. Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performence, I think Tom Hanks will get the Oscar, I also have strong feelings that it will get at least Director and Picture also. I think everyone should see the movie, so everyone knows that World War II wasn't something that was just there. I mean, my Grandfather fought in this war, he saw all this that was happening, your grandfathers faught, and your fathers, and brothers, etc., If you don't leave the theater with tears in your eyes, at least deep down in your heart, you can at least feel sad for these people who had to risk their lives to win the war.My Rate- **** out of ****</fullReview>

The simple idea of complete strangers shooting at eachother is enough. In truth, if spielburg intended to bring us to a moral realization by grossing us out, it is insulting, and I highly doubt spielburg meant to do this. I think Spielburg wanted to give us a new glass with which to comtemplate war, specifically cowardice. The last half-hour haunts me the most, because it raised the question, "Is cowardice a vice or a virtue?" Or, more specifically, "Is cowardice the only sane thing in war?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was wonderful! The sound...the hand-held cameras, everything. Speilberg has re-created the method of how to tell a war story, for the better. It was a little gory, but everyone should see this movie except young children, and WWII vets (May bring back flashbacks...they've been through enough) The only thing I thought was weak about Saving Private Ryan was its characters....in a war movie like Platoon, you're incredibly horrified to see the characters die, because you feel like you actually know them. Its like you were there with them. You KNEW them, you FELT for them. This was completely absent in Saving Private Ryan. It was still great though. Oscar for Hanks, Speilberg, the movie itself, sound, and a best supporting actor for either Edward Burns, or Matt Damon. Oscars all around for this movie! There's no way there will be a better film this year.</fullReview>

Never before has a movie touched my inner spirit as SPR. It is an explosive film that fills the viewer with such ghastly images, that you are left numb with astonishment. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, has given us the most realistic, horrific, and true vision of war we as an audience may ever see. As a college student studying to be a teacher, I pray that one day this film will be required viewing for all history students. Please, see this film!! If not for the sheer entertainment of seeing the highest standard of filmmaking this year (possibly ever!!) see it out of respect for the millions of men and women who gave their lives for our way of life.

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. It depicts war in the way that General Sherman described it: all hell. There are some terrific scenes and a lot to talk about afterwards. There is a lot of gore, especially at the beginning, but I didn't have as much of a problem with that as I had imagined I would. Other scenes made me more uncomfortable (which was good; I should be uncomfortable with them.)I had a problem with the present-day bookends; they were ok, but too sweet. And there were some places where I think the movie told us too much, which always seems to me like the easy way out. Show us instead! I had a line or two that didn't ring true for me; one was too modern sounding, too funny; I assume it was ad-libbed. There were a couple of details that didn't ring true. And there is at least one major detail that my coworkers did not get: is the guy who...the same guy who...the same guy who... or are there three different guys? Each of us sees it differently.So--it's really powerful, and I think people should see it to get a feel for history. But it's not the best movie of the year; nor is it Spielberg's best movie. Truman Show is better this year, and Schindler's List is Spielberg's best that I've seen.</fullReview>

If you want to see this movie for the plot of 8 men saving the lives of 1 and the questions, conflicts, and emotions that go along with that, don't see this movie. I went because I was interested in the Sullivan law and the internal conflicts that arise from it.However, if you want to be appalled and emotionally changed by the realities of war, this is the movie for you. It is so powerful. During the first twenty minutes, there was nothing but horrified silence from the audience with a gasp interjected here and there. The battle scenes were so gory and jarring that I found myself bracing myself for the next battle scene as opposed to concentrating on what little character development there was actually taking place.That leads me to the characters. I thought the acting was excellent, but the character development lacking. By the time I actually began to get to know a character or care about him, a battle started or he was killed (graphically). I thought Tom Sizemore did an excellent job along with Tom Hanks. For the whole 15 minutes Matt Damon was actually on-screen, I thought he too, was excellent.I felt like I ended up paying for 3 hours of camera-shaking, bloody, musicless torture.

		<shortDescription>War is *this*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many of the great war films..."Platoon", "All's Quiet on the Western Front", "The Longest Day", "A Bridge Too Far", "Gallipoli". At their best, these great war films made me commiserate with the plight of the common soldier, see the futility and the waste of war, and understand the sacrifices made to preserve the world I live in today.All of them, however, were observed by me. They moved me, but they were still somehow distant.Not so with "Saving Private Ryan". From the opening frame, I was *there*. I wasn't watching a moving tribute, I was being shot at, watching comrades die horribly, and running for my life. This movie will make those who've never been to war say, "My God, that's what it was really like" and any veteran say, "My God, they've finally shown the truth." If you aren't moved by this film, I'd venture to guess you are either cold-hearted, or a film student who can't get past examining camera angles in order to experience what's going on in front of your face.It was, without a doubt, the most powerful war film I've ever seen, perhaps the most powerful *film* I've ever seen.People gripe about the plot. Those who do, don't know much about military protocol. Yes, eight men might be sent to risk their lives to return one home. After all, it sounds like a far easier mission than it actually turns out to be...until the chaos of a large scale military operation enters into the picture. Far sillier orders have been issued in every major war in history.As for the camera work, complain about the jostling camera all you want. There's only so much you can do to simulate the fog of war, how everything seems slightly off-kilter when the bullets start flying and your stomach knots up. The Oscar for cinematography, which is a shoe-in, will be vindication enough against the naysayers.If you absolutely can't stand gore and violence onscreen, this film is not for you. For anyone who can, please don't miss it. It truly is unforgettable.It will win Spielberg his second directorial Oscar, it will win for cinematography, it will win best picture, and Hanks will probably win for best actor. Also look for Tom Sizemore to be nominated for best supporting actor. I know, I know...the Oscar year is hardly over. It doesn't matter. It was that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Bad Headache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first segment makes you say, "hmmm, I wonder what this is about". Then it cuts to the Omaha Beach invasion. As war-realistic as Spielberg wants us to believe it is, the most realism that this segment portrays is the excruciating pains WW2 soldiers felt as compared to our excruciating headaches we received from this "vibrating cam". Don't get me wrong. I think the first and last war segment should have been shot with this camera, but all the segments in between should have been toned down. Any scene shot with this cam would make just about any person want to vomit, whether it be a love scene or just a still scene. I understand that Spielberg wanted to mix the effect received psychologically to make one uncomfortable with the effect received from the explosions, blood, guts, and screaming to make this movie seem "real". Well, it worked. But still, it was a movie that people want to be entertained, and the only entertainment received was during the calm scenes. On the IMDB scale, I gave it an 8. Bad spec writing, but good rewriting by Frank, who gave us Malice, Get Shorty, and Out of Sight. Great direction. Bad cam, bad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPR - very moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things crossed my mind as I watch the horror and drama unfold on the screen. First, I was truly sorry for not taking time to remember our war dead last Memorial Day. Seems like many of us are more concerned about a long holiday weekend and our plans then remembering the reason for Memorial Day (or Veterans Day).We post our comments how SPR moved us and shocked us - lets see if we remember this with some sort of action next Memorial Day. The second thought I had was picturing relatives and friends from WWII (total of 6) in those circumstances - and then how would I react to the same stimulus. How would I react during those terrifying landings, long campaigns, gaining and losing commrades - very thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most intense movies of all time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone sees this movie and doesn't come away with an awed feeling of what our Fathers and Grandfathers endured to secure our way of life they will never be moved by anything. I have been to countless movies in my lifetime and never have I witnessed such silent devotion as the audience was leaving as for this film, and sprinkle in a few gray &amp; bent old men with tears in their eyes and as I said, it was awesome!!The scene where Mrs. Ryan collapsed on the porch at the approach of the military vehicle was without doubt the most poignant and revealing of the entire film. Makes you know how horrible it was thousands of times for families during the war and I have never seen it portrayed better. If this film, Tom Hanks (who nevermore will be thought of as Forrest Gump), and Spielberg don't all win Oscars they might as well discontinue it for it would be meaningless for any other to receive it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The writing and the story were weak at times. The reason given for why the military would risk the lives of eight soldiers to save one was glossed over. Technically, the movie could not have been any better. The acting was superb all around. Spielberg's direction is to be admired. The cinematography is gorgeous in an eerie way. Unfortunately Spielberg bookended the film with two scenes that were unnecessary and, for me, took away from the impact of the film. But this movie was not about its story, it was about a war. The plot was a vehicle to illustrate the war. And in that respect, the movie successfully completes its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I seen people cringe, stare open-mouthed, cheer, and cry, then walk out of a theater in complete silence.Having witnessed the so-called "greatest act of terrorism ever to occur in our nation," I can only say we have been so naive. My generation doesn't understand what war is. We watch our movies and we get excited by violence and gore, never feeling any guilt or sorrow for the people the actors portray. This film changes all of that. It is so hard to see the men murdered as they do "their duty" and then come to the realization that THIS REALLY HAPPENED. These men, our grandfathers, risked and in some cases gave up their lives to protect all that we take for granted. Today we cry and demand justice for the 169 people who died because a PART of ONE building in a small city was destroyed by a bomb. We can't even begin to imagine running off of the landing boat only to be shot and killed by the unseen enemy. We see countless buildings annihilated in small, tactically insignificant cities.This movie has made a difference in my life. Being only 20, I have to face that it could easily be me in the line of fire if our nation were called once again to defend the cause of freedom and the draft were reinstated. All I can say is after seeing this movie, war and violence will no longer be glorified in my mind. Aside from the stunningly realistic portrayal of war, I can't ignore the fact that the movie itself is spectacular. Although the content takes the front seat, the acting, script, and cinematography are superior. This film is hands down the best of the year, and one of the best movies ever made. Four stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. It's one of Hank's best performances. It has lots of realism. It took more risks (graphically) than most mainstream Hollywood flicks have done. I cried in anger at the waste of lives because of lessons not learned at Dieppe and Anzio. But...... Ultimately the film to me seemed edgeless and empty. Typical Spielberg: all surface and no content. Things were too clean, too neat, too "packaged". The biggest directorial risk he took was in presenting the film as a thread snipped at both ends...we didn't see what came before, and we don't get to see what happens after. The two present -day sequences that open and close the movie are just pretty bookends.The opening was spectacular, and full credits to all for an incredible production. It is as close as any of us are likely to get to war, and the senselessness of the slaughter that is mass war was (as it should be) appalling. Unfortunately, once we moved off the beach, the movie got lost in its own metaphors and cinematic history. I saw too many pieces of older movies and cliches presented. I will admit I didn't see too many gaffes (but why did that paratrooper have a full beard?), and that is good, but lack of goofs does not compensate for lack of imagination. By "edge", I mean taking risks. For example: "Apocalypse Now" had an edge, and too much imagination. Portions of "Platoon" had an edge and imagination. "Titanic" had no edges, but a lot of imagination. "The Crying Game" had lots of edges, and some imagination.So. The opening half-hour gets 4+ stars, the rest, 3.

Most likely, unless Cameron makes his 400 million dollar epic about the Carpathia, "the ship that saved Titanic survivors."All kidding aside, I would like to remind you people about such films as "The Dirty Dozen", "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now", and even "All Quiet on the Western Front". before you make such rash decisions about what is "The Greatest" of anything, I'd like for you to take a gander at the classics. If you still think you're right, then, and only then, would I accept your theory.Saving Private Ryan will be a Hollywood classic, no doubt about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am quite disappointed to hear that Saving Private Ryan is being described as "the greatest war film ever made." It is very simply, "the greatest film ever made." I, personally, have never viewed a film that inspires more raw emotion than this gripping tale of risking eight men to save one. I am glad to see that Dreamworks SKG has finally gotten its act together and developed a high caliber motion picture. The graphic quality of this WWII tale exposes war for what it is: not some heroic venture in the realm of personal glory, but a horrific combination of death and destruction. The use of hand held cameras and dulled color themes only enhances the experience almost to the point of suggesting that the audience is there with Capt. Miller and his men to witness the terror first hand. I truly regard Steven Spielberg as a genius and at the same time cannot imagine any circumstance that would prevent this film from receiving the academy's "best picture" award. In short, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing work of art that cannot be adequately described in words. So go see it, you'll cherish the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie with spectacular visual effect matched with sound that actually makes you feel like you are there, then this is your movie. If you want to see a movie that moves the entire audience in such a way no one moves when it is over, then this is a movie for you. If you want to see the best performance from Tom Hanks hands down, then this is the movie for you. During the first 20 odd minutes, Spielberg puts you in a beach landing. You are there, machine gunners are engaging you from far away bunkers. Artillery and mortar rounds are exploding around you. Brave men are falling. You will urge the American soldiers on, you will duck, you will smell the salt water and blood, you will yell "medic", and you will feel war. Truly, this one battle is the best scene depicting war other than film taken of actual battles (and this may be better). My hat is off to Spielberg. Truly this is a great movie, and only a few can even come close to comparing to it. Not since Schindler's List has a movie moved me. If this movie does not win best picture, best actor, best supporting actor, best director, best writing, best cinematography, best sound, best editing, best effects, and a slew of others then those that vote did not see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was one of the best war movies ever made because it shows what war is really about. I have seen tons of movies where violence is portrayed as a cool shoot-em up blow-em up thing. This movie has a lot of violence but shows the reality of what happened a half -century ago and the horrible brutality of war. The actors were fabulous in recreating the war. Not to mention the battle scenes were perfect. Steven Spielberg has done an excellent job of recreating the events of Omaha Beach in the first 24 minutes of the film. This movie shows war in its most truthful sense. It made me stop and think just how many people died horrible deaths to save our country. It made me want to cry like few movies do. This movie is the closest you will get to seeing what life was like during WWII.</fullReview>

I couldn't stop thinking about this movie after I saw it. The D-Day sequence alone is worth the admission. Your mouth will be wide open the entire 24 minutes. The ending battle was also very good and intense. There images from this movie that I will never forget like a scene where a soldier gets shot in the helmet but it does not punch through the metal and he takes it off to investigate and get his head blown off, or when a soldier runs with a lit sticky bomb at a tank only to have it explode in his hand and blow him to bits. There are some funny parts, but most of the film is serious. This is the best film of Spielberg's and Hank's career. This is going to get more oscars than Titanic. You will never forget this amazing film and hopefully it will teach people that WAR IS HELL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off with an epic opening scene. In this scene Captain Miller and his squad have to take over the beach. During this 'invasion' two brothers are killed. Their third brother is also also killed of, but in New Guinea. After they have taken over the beach, Captain Miller and his crew get another task. They have to find private Ryan. The fourth brother. He is the only remaining brother, so Miller has to get him and bring him back to his mother. It turns out to be harder than they taught. "Saving Ptivate Ryan" is directed by Steven Spielberg. He did an amazing job at directing this movie. He did something special, he made it seem like the main characters stood out. It looked like they took a black and white movie and colored it in, it gave a pretty effect. The cinematography was also perfectly handled. Janusz Kaminski has worked a couple of times with Spielberg, I get why Spielberg had chosen him as the cinematographer. The opening scene (with this I mean the opening fight scene) was just shot amazing. Every shot was just stunningly beautiful. The set design look realistic, The effects in this scene were flawless. You were tense, even though you didn't got the chance to know the characters yet. Everything was fantastic. The realism of the movie was also good. When the camera goes under water in the beginning scene, the sound mutes. This really makes you feel like you are there, with the soldiers. Also, still when the camera is under water, when the bullets hit the water, they slow down and you can see the path that they make through the water. When someone takes a grenade, and they explode, they literally blow up into peaces, you can see body parts fly everywhere. What is also good about this movie are the effects and Make-Up . In the movie there is a lot of gore. And when someone loses a leg or a piece of their skin and there intestines are shown, it is in the movie, it looks so real. And after the first battle sequence the camera flies by the battlefield, and you can see all the dead body's and the water, that has become red of the blood of the soldiers, this was a very touching scene. The acting in this movie was also very good, everybody did their best. Lets star of with the main character. The main character is Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks. Miller is the Captain of his squad, a little bit further on in the review i am going to talk about the squad. He is a broken man due to the war, but there is one thing that keeps him going, completing the mission and to keep his squad alive. Someone else from his squad is Caparzo. He is played by, believe me or not, Vin Diesel. I really didn't recognize him. I was surprised that it was him, he was so good in this movie, I just couldn't believe it. There is also Jeremy Davies he plays Upham. He was also very good. You can really see how afraid that he is of war. Wade, the medic of the crew, is played by Giovanni Ribisi. He was good too. And when he dies, there follows a painful silences and that was hard to watch. Not because it was a bad scene or something, no, it was just such a sad moment. There is also Mellish, played by Adam Goldberg, he was good, nothing special about him. And Horvath is played by Tom Sizemore. When he died at the end I didn"t feel sad, and I don't know why. In the squad there is also Jackson. He is played by Barry Pepper. He was a very skilled sniper, and it was shocking to see him die, when he got blown up. And last but not least, Matt Damon. He played Private Ryan, the soldier that Miller has to get back home. I liked his character a lot he is a loyal friend, who is not willing to leave his crew behind. This covers most of the characters, I am sorry if I have missed one, there are a lot of characters in this movie. The writing of the movie was handled perfectly. There were funny bits. But that doesn't change the mood of the movie, it keeps it's darker tone. You could really feel the friendship of the crew and this was due to the good writing. What I also liked about the writing, even though this does not relate much to th writing, is when Miller goes away to cry. This was a powerful scene, and gave the character a more relatable person, it made him feel more real.The part that i loved a bit more than the beginning fight scene is the final fight scene. I loved watching how they prepared themselves and the bridge for an upcoming attack. The whole 'Bridge' scene is just so tense full. And when they finally attack, you just start screaming at your screen, because Upham, doesn't dare to do something. Becaude of him some characters died, that he could have saved. But when the battle is over, and he has his gun pointed at some German soldiers. He recognizes a soldier. It is the soldier that killed Wade. When Wade was killed they let that soldier go, but first they are planning to kill him. Then at a certain point Upham says 'what is happening' when they want to shoot the unarmed German soldier. And I think that he means with this what happened to us, how war has changed them, this is a positive thing. But when he holds the gun pointed at the German soldiers, he pulls the trigger and kills the man, out of revenge. Also a powerful scene.The ending is beautiful. I would recommend watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies opening scene is one of the most brutal, horrific, yet accurate representations of war I have seen. This scene sets the mood for the whole movie. While the rest of the movie is not quite as intense, it quickly involves you in the characters and you sympathize with them because of what they have endured. You truly care for them and are interested in their well being. The realization that what they have experienced is only the beginning of the story is a grim one indeed. The war is not over, and thus it is not finished shaping the men in focus. They will be molded and formed in innumerable ways as the war takes a hold of their psyche and their lives. In conclusion, I believe this is the best war movie of all time and one of if not Steven Spielberg's best films.</fullReview>

By watching this film you can understand how bad a war is especially when it is a World War. I still couldn't understand how Saving Private Ryan couldn't win the best Picture award in 1999. American Beauty isn't as impressive as Saving Private Ryan. This film deserves to be in top 10 in IMDb. Please watch and decide yourself.</fullReview>

The Score by John Williams is haunting and restrained like the film and the film does not rely on the score so much but the Hymn to the Fallen is the most haunting piece of music I have ever heard and should be played at all remembrance services but is not why I have no idea! Just a unforgettable film and yet again like the Color Purple in the most unjust Oscars ever Saving Private Ryan Did not win best Picture Steven Spielberg won Best Director but what beat Saving Private Ryan to the Best Picture award Shakespeare In Love crazy and a disgusting unjust decision the worst decision the Oscars have ever made that and the Color Purple not winning Best Picture are just wrong decisions just wrong they knew they were the best pictures of 1985 and 1998 and they got it wrong so wrong the third time this has happened actually with ET losing to Gandhi in 1982 just wrong decisions! Anyway I want to finish by saying Thank you to Steven Spielberg and John Williams yet again you have directed and composed another masterpiece together and this film is a haunting and beautiful requiem for all the men who gave their life's for us and for that I hereby award this film Best Picture of 1998 even if the Oscars will not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a very well made movie, I especially enjoyed the part where they are enjoying the beach together. Even though the weather is bad.The movie starts with buddy army guys getting on a boat to travel to France together and enjoy a lovely summer. Although the beach in France is already occupied by angry German visitors that polluted the beach with their junk.Its the army their task to clean the mess up and tell the president of Germany that their country tourists are pigs and need to clean up their mess.It could be a summers best if they left out the angry Germans. But without them it would be a silly movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A war movie? You missed at least half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the most amazing recreation of a war epos in one shot (or how to compress a wonder movie like The Longest Day in 20 minutes), Tom Hanks graces us with a personal travel through Normandy based in personal weakness and group strengths. How a literature teacher, with experience in summer basket teams, can cope with the horrors and unsensical situations of a total war? Just following the logic of the situation: field manual up to the core and thinking that every life lost represents ten saved. "Angels on our shoulders" will grant us the possibility to earn a full life. Do we deserve it? Only a row of marbled crosses will be able to answer... Why then not a 10? Simple... I have seen German War graveyards... where each cross is shared by 3 persons per side. With people from early 50's to those that barely reached 18. War is hell for all... not only for Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is (in my opinion) Spielberg's best, and when it comes to war movies, a strong contender for the best war movie ever. The storyline makes you question the mission and the sacrifice of lives in war throughout the whole movie. The story is touching and made me angry at the same time. The great cinematography and equally great special effects emerge you in the story. The cast is great, and works great as an ensemble. Typical for a Spielberg movie, John Williams made the music, and didn't disappoint. It brings war and all its terrors to screen in a more emerging way than any other movie (e.g. the opening D- Day scene). An absolute must see movie, especially for war movie fans.</fullReview>

This movie doesn't show glory of war. I'm a huge WW2 buff and my Grandfather(on my mother's side) served with 691st Tank Destroyer Battalion during the European campaign with the U.S. I also had family member, who was a U.S Marine that died on the U.S.S California during the Attack on Pearl Harbor.In the end this a well made film fore every film lover because it is an excellent war drama that puts you in the war with really develop characters who are not portrayed as heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best WW2 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is the best WW2 film out there. It starts off with a memorable 25 minute opening sequence which is arguably the best scene in a Spielberg movie. It is highly realistic for its time and it's tense from beginning to end. At the end of the sequence, it shows you a dead soldier from the "Ryan" family. Later we find out that 3 of the 4 members of his family died and Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of 7 soldiers are sent to bring the remaining brother back to his family before he dies as well. With an unforgettable story, the plot is quite moving even just thinking about it. The movie was also expertly shot and acted. Every action scene is realistic as it is bloody. After soldiers are killed off, it makes the soldiers question if the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them. The final battle has a big buildup and carries on for just the right length.The ending is tragic and it gets me every time but its emotional resonance sticks with the viewer after watching it. This is one of the best films of the 90's due to its impact on the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie and an all-time great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important movies of the 1990s and a triumph for Steven Spielberg, helping to keep alive the story of the Greatest Generation and remind us of the sacrifice of war.Spielberg takes time to introduce us to a small band of soldiers, getting to see the end of World War 2 through their eyes. The movie follows the last days of the European war, as the American forces push into France against a Nazi army that is not yet ready to give up. To say much more would be giving away major plot developments, but the plot features several major surprises and gripping battle scenes."Saving Private Ryan" also features an incredible cast, including Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and many cameo appearances from Nathan Fillion, Ted Danson and others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a disturbingly real film that can be hard to watch for some people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and I do believe this film is fantastic, but I believe that it is not a ten out of ten film for a few reasons that I will explain. This film is based in ww2 and the start of the film is the invasion of Normandy better known as d-day. After the battle a group of 8 soldiers are sent on an important mission to rescue a private who's other brothers have been killed recently. Now tom thanks is now established as one of the best actors ever and it is films like this that is why. His performance as the commander felt real it felt like he knew his duty but he was relatable to us because of the way he acted in certain situations. This man is a superstar and he truly encapsulates everything that this commander has to go through. The supporting cast all also do a really good job, this film is not a character study film but everything the characters go through make you feel for them and empathise with the characters. Now the story is where I actually think this film slightly misses, I do believe it plays up the war part of the story well and also the social issues that are explored should be applauded and are very good. However, towards the middle of this film it just felt like 30-40 mins could have been cut out because nothing relevant to the story happens and it could have been done in a better way. The script is really good with the dialogue feeling natural among war buddies and it also makes you feel like you are in battle with them. The style is great I applaud Spielberg for making this film more realistic with the brutality because that was how war really was. A lot of directors try to pc it but not a top director and it adds to the realistic gritty feeling that this film possesses. This is a heavy film and it can be hard to watch sometimes but it is a fantastic film that truly delivers on its message and does indeed deserve a lot of praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still-Powerful Effects and Performances Leave Us Knee-Deep in the Great War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War II, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is more than just the Omaha Beach invasion, it is a mission to save a lone soldier in German-held France</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the movie starts with what was a part of Omaha Beach, called the Normandy memorial now, filled with the graves of Allied soldiers who fought and died in the Normandy invasion. He finds the gravestone, along with his family, of soldier John Miller, and then recalls the fateful day of the invasion in his mind. There are reminders of the cheesy movie known as "The Longest Day", as the Omaha Beach invasion scene in "Private Ryan" takes full swing. Over 15 minutes of terror, fright, and blood-letting as heavy German resistance with mortars and endless sprays of machine-gun fire rained death on the Allied soldiers who landed on the beach with their landing craft. The Allies get stopped by the heavy and deadly resistance but finds their way to get through the enemy in the beachhead with Bangalore torpedoes, flamethrowers, and sniper rifles. When all was over, we see that Daniel Ryan fell dead on the beach, and we get the first words on three Ryans who fell in World War II, but not James Francis. We get word on the parachute mis-drops that were part of the Normandy invasion which meant James Francis Ryan did not know that all of his 3 relatives died in combat, so a rescue mission deep in the German-held front lines of France is in store. We then get the first scenes of John Miller, who is picked to find a small platoon for the mission. He finds soldiers, and then the mission is on, right into the French countryside. First skirmish against the Germans is in a small French town in a heavy rainstorm where one of the platoon soldiers, Mr. Caparza, finds a French baby whom a French family wants to liberate. Caparza takes the baby, but because he was mistaken as a Nazi soldier (he was really an American soldier, but he was bald-headed), a French resistance soldier-sniper takes Caparza down with one shot in the chest. The platoon realize this and decided to find the sniper but have to leave Caparza alone and tell him not to move or he would get shot again. Fortunately, the sniper was taken out but Caparza eventually dies on the ground.More small skirmishes against the Germans were in store upon finding James Francis Ryan. In one lull in the fighting, they almost got the soldier they wanted who was James Ryan but with a different middle name (which was, regrettably, Patrick), so the search continues. Then, after a German prowler (a half-track) was destroyed in another French open field as the search continued, the platoon finds another platoon that destroyed the tank - it was the platoon with James Francis Ryan. The platoon got their man. The final thing was for his survivors - the platoon itself and the surviving Ryan, to fight against a small German army that almost outnumbered them, in the town of Ramelle. The firefight had to be creative because they used ammo that was just left - not too much. James Ryan does survive and the firefight ends when the P-51 Mustangs finished off the Germans, but John Miller gets shot and dies in the combat.James Ryan survives, still looking at his fallen soldier on the Normandy beach memorial, thinking about his duty for country that he had done on this major turning point in World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I can not really say anything about "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) that was not said before countless of times. I'm just going to praise it one more time. "Saving Private Ryan" is a masterpiece of movie-making, it's true. Almost no other war film can't take you to the place like this picture does. "Apocalypse Now" and "Saving Private Ryan" are the best war movies ever. Very different, yet very similar on the note of anti-war ideas. Now back to "Saving Private Ryan". The opening scene is ... well, you all know, it's a jaw dropping experience, and i mean, experience - for a 20 min you can partly feel what is war and how it was to a soldiers on that day. This scene alone is a excruciating masterpiece. The film settles then in to a journey through hell picture, it still remains unforgettable. No matter how many times you are watching "Saving Private Ryan", it grabs you from the opening scene and does not let go this the very last image. As i don't think there are people who never saw this film, i can just say, watch it again. It'a a film to remember, and to learn. It'a a masterpiece on all levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite war movie. I like it except the final battle. Our troops totally got ripped to shreds. Cpl Upham, he is a coward. I know he isn't used to this combat, but he is essential to all the other troops. He is carrying the extra ammo. He was too scared to help that private fight that enemy troop and was to scared to give the troops more ammo to the MG. If I was him, I would've been scared too, but I would've done it anyway for my brothers. Also, in the beginning, when they opened the door to get off the landing craft, you are already dead. I think that's crazy. Plus, when they confronted the real Private Ryan, he refused to go home. Isn't that a rule in which if all your brothers die, you are supposed to go home?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Saving Private Ryan' is the most realistic and powerful war film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sacrifice is often challenging for men in dangerous positions. No eight film characters besides the eight soldiers in Steven Spielberg's war masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan' have dedicated more sacrifice in the history of film. WW II was a harsh war that caused many fatalities and tragedies. Entire families like the Ryan boys were sent out to war. In 'Saving Private Ryan' we see four brothers loose 75% of their legacy, leaving only Private James Ryan to live. When Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out with seven other soldiers to rescue Private Ryan so that the Ryan family would have one last child to hang on two. As the eight men try and rescue Private Ryan somewhere in the battlefields of Germany, they encounter extreme war situations causing fatalities and conflict between the eight men. Many argue with each other, loose hope, show strong emotions, and complain about how the eight of them have to risk their lives for one man. However, some positivism is derived from their mission. Many friendships are formed between soldiers as they connect with each other and help each other through battle. Steven Spielberg's directing is extremely superb and magnificence. He takes you into the line of war liken no filmmaker, and has extremely intense and realistic battle sequences to show how much sacrifice the brave men of WW II gave in order to promote peace and liberty. The battle sequences are perfectly made with amazing editing, sound, and effects that are entertaining for the powerful soul purpose and to make the story strong. Bravo to the actors Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davis, and Tom Sizemore for giving powerful performances as soldiers throughout the entire film, and never getting off guard in the film. The main theme of 'Saving Private Ryan' is not only to give the first hand experience of WW II battle brought to life, but to show a story of sacrifice. The mission to save Private Ryan is a metaphor for how soldiers throughout history give of themselves for others, and how their sacrifice can never be thanked enough. This is the best war film ever made!</fullReview>

I saw it again and again for years to come only to like it more every time. The rawness and originality in the art of the battle scenes is just amazing; the gore, the sadness, the cinematography, it's all there. I'm not even a big fan of Spielberg's work and aside from Schindler's List, this is the only other film that I love by Spielberg. I give it a 9 for its long driven awesome plot with WELL developed characters(main, supportive, etc.) and gruesome battle scenes. The use of foreign languages when needed was also there.

		<fullReview>I've never been in the military, let alone been in any type of real combat situation. Despite this, I feel like I have a semi-realistic idea of what it would be like; and that is absolutely horrible. I can't see any good that a soldier can take away from combat and this film does a remarkable job of depicting the ugly truths of this, in a way that almost anyone over the age of 12 can appreciate. If you are attempting to shield your child from the ugly truths of life on this earth and specifically American history and war, then don't show them this film. When watching this film, I can actually feel the pain of the protagonist as he fights his way towards his objective. Obviously, this pain is nowhere near the level of what the soldier whom this film was based off of and all others directly involved actually felt, but I feel it is as close as you can get without being involved. This film incorporates fantastic writing, CGI, cinematography, set-building, acting and basically every other level of production to create the most realistic World War II Normandy depiction I have ever seen. The only reason I would not rate this movie any higher is because that would make it a 10 and I believe perfection is impossible in the art of film production, but it's about as close as it gets without 3D or any other realism enhancing technologies. Watch this film and gain a better understanding of what many of America's young men were experiencing at the time of the second world war and also how they were mentally and physically effected from the horrific events which ensued.</fullReview>

Following the infamous D-Day invasion Captain Miller and his men must traverse the dangerous Nazi infested countryside to find Private James Ryan, so that he may return home among the chaos that is war.Not only one of the finest war movies ever crafted, but one of the finest human dramas ever filmed.

Said to have made veterans weep during its release and during its intense first thirty mins, as its depiction of the events of D-Day upon the beaches of Normandy to be the most realistic and finest ever captured on film.

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's 1998 war film, Saving Private Ryan, is a monumental picture. It portrays the rawest, most real-feeling, vision of war that I have ever seen. Though the grave portrayals and subject matter exclude Saving Private Ryan from being a traditionally entertaining film, it is still very engaging. It falls prey to some issues characteristic of war films and some issues characteristic of Spielberg films, but those do not take away Saving Private Ryan's claim to greatness that it rightfully deserves.There is not an ounce of blood nor spray of bullets from beginning to end that doesn't feel real. Many highly violent films lose their impact entirely when the special effects are less than convincing and when character deaths feels too complicit to the story. Thankfully Saving Private Ryan has incredible, mainly practical, special effects, and the film is not afraid to kill even its most sympathetic characters in addition to literally boat loads of extras. The opening flashback to Omaha Beach is an incredible feat in cinema and likely the best subjective view of warfare caught on film. When the doors of the boats open and German machine guns mow down the U.S. soldiers without a moment's hesitation, it is truly shocking. For one shot the camera is in the position of a soldier near the back of a boat, his comrades in front of him. The doors open and all the soldiers in frame are ripped of their lives by an unstoppable hail of bullets. The fact that I would be dead if were there is effectively disturbing. Some other shots take place underwater. Down there the screams of the dying, pounding of artillery, and incessant chatter of machine guns are muffled. For a second I felt calm and safe, before a couple bullets penetrated the water and the soldiers beneath it, calming their struggle and causing plumes of blood to rise to the surface. The scene continues in this fashion for an extended time as it follows a group of soldiers fighting their way up the beach, eventually to victory for that specific skirmish. The Omaha Beach scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, and the final battle of the bridge matches it, providing a nice bookend for the rest of the story to play out between. Some death scenes are truly disturbing. They force you to look at your own mortality right in the face. I should mention that the direction is superb. The audience is able to achieve a new perspective on war from Spielberg's outstanding ability to link action and build a sense of omniscience coupled with harsh subjectivity. I didn't detect a false move in the entire film. While the film is a true achievement, its reliance on shock causes its impact to decrease with subsequent viewings (I've seen it thrice), but I still recognize it as a great film. One thing that detracted from Saving Private Ryan, conflicting with the realism, was its sentimentality, driven by John Williams' seemingly ubiquitous score. The sentimentality felt out of place and left a bad taste in my mouth. I could almost call the film cloying at times. Thankfully, during the parts that really matter there is no music and no forced emotion, only what happens right before your eyes which is enough to change you by itself.War films tend to be very pure. Many times they are almost exclusively about survival, an objective, and the non-romantic relationships between the soldiers. Saving Private Ryan fits into this category. For me this excludes a certain aspect of cinema that I crave. It excludes a sense of culture, artistry, and beauty. The film is too raw for my liking. Whenever the characters come to a new town they find it in a state of wreckage. The once beautiful architecture is reduced to rubble and potential strategic positions. Of course Saving Private Ryan relies a great deal on realism and the decision to maintain its purity as a war film certainly contributes to its realism. Nevertheless my complaint stands.For what is essentially an existential film, Saving Private Ryan manages to the fill its running time with engaging scenes, one after another. There are many incidental, almost arbitrary, occurrences. The taking of the French girl, the knocking down of a wall to reveal a platoon of enemy soldiers. The list goes on. Yes these scenes are sufficiently engaging even if each one does not contribute to a central story thrust. More than that they add to the sense of mayhem and disarray that surely accompanies soldiers embroiled in such a conflict. Whereas I might be tempted to label this style as fluff or meaningless in other films, the existential mode fits Saving Private Ryan very well.Saving Private Ryan is a great film. It is an achievement in cinema and also fascinating to watch. While a few issues prevent me from calling it a masterpiece I can confidently say that I will watch it again someday.33/40</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most realistic war movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Saving Private Ryan is about a captain in the US army during World War II, who must risk him and his men's lives to rescue a soldier who has lost his three brothers. Growing up I was so fascinated with WW2. I read about all aspects of it, so I had a pretty good idea of the horrors of combat. But I got a very clear look at war with this movie. The 20 minute opening of US soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy, is outstanding. Steven Spielberg captures every bit of gore and and violence, with young boys crying for there mother, soldiers losing their limbs, men having to muster every ounce of courage to survive the hell that is war. With amazing cinematography and sound that puts the audience right in the battlefield, we are shown how war can make even the manliest man weep like a child and what each soldier believes in and what they fight for. For me there are a few scenes that make the movie great. Obliviously the beach scene is one of them. After Wade dies from the machine gun nest, there is one German soldier who survives, and the men let out there hate and rage on him. Forgetting what is the right thing to do, the men have been so damaged by combat they then fight with one another whether letting the German go or not. The other scene is in the last battle, Upham is responsible for bringing ammo to Mellish, but Upham is so frozen with fear. And when Mellish is fighting hand to hand with a German, Upham is outside and able to save Mellish, but stays on the staircase crying, and when Mellish is dead, the German wouldn't even kill Upham. This movie does a flawless in showing the terrible effects war has on humans. This movie is so realistic, that when it was released in theaters, the army had to create a hotline for war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder.......convinced?10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting war trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Note: this review is a mash-up several reviews written by students in an English class at Lycée Henri Cornat in France.During the Second World War, the Ryan family loses three sons and one is missing. Three of them died in the fighting. One of them is missing in the Cotentin: his name is James Ryan. Their mother receives a telegram telling her about the death of her sons. Captain Miller's mission is to find Private Ryan. This absence of action gives me a patriotic impression, which may be a little bit ridiculous, especially when the camera is focused on Tom Hank 's eyes (an excellent actor to me because of his great career). The trailer depicts the soldiers as courageous and brave heroes: it remind of famous French saying « un pour tous et tous pour un » that is to say soldiers are very united.One of points I appreciate is that the trailer doesn't show any frames of the film at the beginning but only archived to the WW2. I think it's a good thing because the trailer doesn't spoil the film. But at the same time after seeing the trailer I don't really know if it was focused on the action or on the military brotherhood. Here, the soldiers are shown as brave, courageous and self-sacrificing. They are depicted as heroes. We find brotherhood, loyalty, and friendship. They are portrayed as heroes because, we can see and suppose that they 'fight' with the suffering. In the end of the trailer, we see a dark landscape with a hill and only a man who is a soldier because he has a gun. There are clouds, and the sky is dark. In the closing image, we can see clouds: it may be to show all the soldiers who had lost their lives, and it reminds us that death is all around.This amazing representation of WW2 stresses the emotional dimension of war. If you want to see a movie about war only, don't watch this film because the most important in the story is the mission of some soldiers and not the fight against Nazi Germany. Overall, we can say that this trailer makes people want to see this original film about the war. It's not a shocking trailer, and mainly the touching side is shown. A war film for girls?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest War Films of Its or Any Other Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the opening 30 minutes into Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking, destroyed many Hollywood clichés in the process, completely redefined the combat genre &amp; permanently cemented this film's place amongst the greatest examples of war cinema.The movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of Normandy by Allied powers during the Second World War &amp; the main plot surfaces after that. It concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg's direction this time challenges &amp; breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience' psyche &amp; takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood, bullets &amp; limbs flying around. Add to that, the camera-work with its desaturated colour &amp; point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism too.Just like any other Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing, visual effects, sound &amp; everything is top-notch although John Williams' score doesn't have much to contribute to the whole film. The performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with Hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performance.Yet, in spite of all the praise &amp; it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on- screen, it isn't a flawless work &amp; comes with its share of disappointments. The biggest drawback about Saving Private Ryan is that after its unforgettable opening sequence, the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime &amp; even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the end.Another major problem I have with it is the film's relentless emphasis on glorifying America since some real-life events depicted here completely ignore the aid US received from other allies during the D-Day landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the German soldiers is absolutely insulting. It's specifically made for American audience &amp; doesn't have a universal appeal like many other films of its genre.On an overall scale, Saving Private Ryan presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense, powerfully moving, brutally realistic &amp; truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense. And for that alone, it will forever be remembered as one of its genre's finest works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this isn't the greatest WWII movie then it's close. I would say it is definitely the greatest except "Platoon" is such a close contender for me.The action is gut-wrenching real and the scene of the storming of Omaha Beach is truly a frightening spectacle. If Spielberg was out to eradicate romantic notions anyone might hold about war he succeededThe decision to rescue Ryan is, in my mind, a poor one but something similar actually did happen and Ryan looking for the grave of his beloved captain who saved his soul could have been mawkish but while a little too sentimental it did work for me.The entire movie was a corroboration of Sherman's comment that "War is Hell". Just to make sure his point is driven home one of the ironies Spielberg embedded in the movie is every act of mercy would have lethal consequences for the soldier who showed compassion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Second best war movie ever made is a timeless experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg during his career has always shown a certain interest for the World War II, in movies like "1941", "Empire of the Sun", "Schindler's List" and of course "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Last Crusade" that was perfect clear. He affirmed that in a interview that he considers the WWII one of the most significant events of the last hundred years, and always sought to portray it somehow. It took the screenwriter Robert Rodat and Tom Hanks to show to Spielberg a story almost like "Apocalypse Now", inspired by an event of the civil war, taking place during the Second World War, to the master retract the war in the best way (possibly) ever made."Saving Private Ryan" is takes place soon after the invasion of the Normandy at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. With Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) getting a mission, coming from the General George C. Marshall itself, to rescue a paratrooper private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who lost three brothers in combat, two on D-Day and one in New Guinea. Now the Captain along with 7 of his best men have to travel in the middle of the war in France and cross enemy lines to save the life of a man who doesn't even know. But the dangers and sacrifices will bring challenges and moral dilemmas to the soldiers and their mission.When I said that Spielberg retracted the WWII in the best way ever made I wasn't bluffing. Of course he showed the consequences of the Holocaust in a terrifying and brilliantly in his masterpiece "Schindler's List". But here, Spielberg completely redefines the genre of war films forever. What was always shown (except for "Apocalypse Now") always with a romantic and patriotic story, Spielberg manages to show its brutality.Many today consider this film the best war movie ever made, and others think "Apocalypse Now" already occupies this place. Both films follow different paths and tones, but tell a story very similar with almost the same dilemma: "The sacrifice of many lives by one live". But Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" went much further than that, exploring the psychological and disturbing side of the Vietnam War including its origins without ever taking a patriotic side as Spielberg does here momentarily. So "Apocalypse" is by a far superior film.What Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat do is follow a simpler path but still excellent. Showing for several moments in the film dilemmas about saving a man in the middle of hell. And that leads to relationship of the soldiers, that early in the film was a brotherhood of partnership, begins to fade with the sacrifices being made by a soldier who they never saw or met and it is probably dead. But there is where one of the few of the problems in the film appear, some of the characters deserved a better development but anything ruins our feelings at the end of the film.Well, so far I've only been talking about moral dilemmas and comparisons. Now let's cut to the part where Spielberg revolutionizes everything, in his direction. Coppola gave in "Apocalypse" the classic "nalpam" bombing of the village, followed with marines stealing surfboards and surfing. Spielberg gave the best battles and shootings ever made and put in a war movie. Literally putting us in the middle of the flying bullets and explosions hurting our ears. And for the people that still criticize Spielberg for making children's and cheesy films, get ready to see bodies being mutilated and blood splash on your face. Showing the terrible reality and brutality of war, the real hell.In the performances level, the film doesn't disappoint at all. Each of the 8 (9 if you count Ryan at the end of the movie, oh, spoiler). Since Barry Pepper as the best sniper in a movie since Robert De Niro; Tom Sizemone as the best partner to have in a battlefield, and Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks is, simply brilliant.While not be the best war movie ever made (thanks to Coppola), "Saving Private Ryan" is a essential viewing film. Spielberg through another magnificent direction shows the cruel reality and brutality of war, coated with bright dilemmas thanks to Rodat's script, presented with yet another brilliant performance by Tom Hanks. "Saving Private Ryan" is not perfect or the best war movie ever made, but it is sure a timeless war and movie classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War/ Anti-war Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's World War II drama, Saving Private Ryan is more of a drama than a war film. The war in Saving Private Ryan is the stage, setting up a playground for a number of individuals caught in a singular situation, forced to make singular choices. As a character quotes in the film, "War educates the senses, calls into the action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man." Saving Private Ryan is about all that. It explodes into life with an assault on the senses, will (or the lack of it) drives characters and the story along with them and collisions are aplenty. The strength of Saving Private Ryan lies in its characters, who are more than mere foot soldiers in this theatre of war. The film starts off with the landing of an US battalion at Normandy . Soon, the storyline swings to an unpredictable path and the viewer is engaged in the thoughts and actions of a group of men whose paths, both literally and figuratively, are laden with uncertainty.However, the reason that Saving Private Ryan is a remarkable chapter in cinema history is not just its storyline, characters and their acts, but the theatre of their play itself. Spielberg brings out the ferocity of war to tremendous effect. The viewer is bombarded with gruesome sights and shell-shocking sounds. The violence is captured with immense skill, but true to what is perhaps one of the themes of the film as well as its maker, is never glorified or even rendered aesthetic.As for the performances, nearly the entire cast is terrific, rendering the movie's exceptional circumstances a credibility which wraps the viewer in its web.The setting of WW II has deeply influenced cinema and directors from lands far and wide. In the gallery of those films, there are quite a few masterpieces, most of which are united by the fact that they are more than mere war films or war stories, binding in tales of the human spirit. Saving Private Ryan, effortlessly, belongs to that top drawer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful War Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg once again won a best directing Academy Award for this powerful film(based on fact) that opens with the D-Day invasion on Normandy France, and the battle to secure the beaches as the first step toward liberating France. The battle itself is the most realistic portrayal of actual battle conditions ever put to film, so authentic is the chaos, violence, and impact bullets and explosions would really have on limbs and bodies(no sugar-coating or censoring here!) that it is both fascinating yet disturbing as well. Tom Hanks plays Capt. Miller, who is in charge of the platoon, and once the beaches are secured, he is ordered to locate and return home a Private Ryan(Matt Damon) because he has just lost three brothers in battle, and the Army doesn't want the bad publicity of a grieving mother mourning all four sons. Though he and his platoon are astonished by the order, they obey it, and the rest of the film is their journey to find Ryan, and still fight the war.The first section of the film on the beaches is so powerful and realistic, that the search for Ryan almost feels anti-climatic, yet this film still works because of the realism and superb storytelling involved, though the prologue and epilogue lack the dramatic fireworks they were aiming for, they are still moving enough.</fullReview>

The film is notable for its graphic and realistic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which depict the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. The film follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To everyone else, Saving Private Ryan would be a career defining film, both a critical success and a box office smash, but for Steven, it's nothing more than another stone in the pillar of greatness that is Spielberg, - just when you thought he had laid out all his cards on the table, he finds a way of surprising us again and again, as with each passing of a decade, he is constantly reinventing himself. With the like of; E.T, Schindler's list, Jaws and close encounters of the third kind, he has successfully cemented himself as the greatest living directors in the world. And Saving Private Ryan is testimony to that, a truly gripping and harrowing war film, unparallelled in the last 20 years. Blending breathtakingly stunning cinematography, skilled and controlled camera movements and sublime storytelling that is now regarded as a staple of all Spielberg films. But not too forget the help he received from an almighty performance by Tom Hanks, star of such films as; Toy story (1,2 and 3), Forrest Gump and most recently Cloud Atlas. From the gecko, we see instantly know why Spielberg won an Oscar for best director, as near the beginning of the film when the troops land on Omaha Beach on D-day in the midst of a horrific and bloody tug of war with the Germans - In a scene lasting for a staggering 24 minutes, but I would have gladly sat for another 20 on top, due to the share epic that it was. From the start of the scene, the camera work is somewhat very unstable, Spielberg's use of hand-held camera movement during the scene, helps add the effect of confusion and a rush adrenalin, so from the very start we are almost swept into the scene and immersed into the carnage. The instability of the camera movements perfectly reflects the total and utter chaos that the soldiers experienced. And I love this, because it showing us rather than telling us through 10 minutes of the soldiers talking about how bad the war is, making it far more captivating ? a smart move from Steven. It is also interesting to note that the opening sequence is filmed in de- saturated colours, emphasising the negativity of the situation, making it seem more morose. This visual pathetic fallacy continues with the dark, stormy weather, making the death seem all the more cold and devoid of emotion. I could easily just review the opening sequence, because it was just that good! It should be taught at film school as a manual on great cinematography. Eventually amongst all the anarchy we discover the dead body of soldier with Ryan written on his backpack. Then fast forward a few days later, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) reveals to Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), that all three Ryan brothers from the same family have been killed, and he tells John to find the fourth Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), so his mother can have at least one son alive, so she doesn't have to go through that pain of knowing all her sons are dead. John Miller then brings together a troop of trusty soldiers to aid him in this quest. Consisting of; Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper). What follow is a heart wrenching journey for both us and the men, as Spielberg cleverly draws out of us all, the colours of the emotional wheel as we've; Laughed with them, felt regret as some of them die on their journey, we have been scared as the ever looming Germans approach, we felt anger, frustration and the occasional breathtaking triumph. But what the performance I love the most out of that list of talented actors a superb performance is was performance of Tom hanks, outside the storytelling and the cinematography, it truly stood out for me, from the first time he pops up in screen, during the being on Omaha Beach, When we move on to one landing craft in particular, through a series of close ups we see the share terror in the eyes of some of the soldiers, then we shift to a close up of Tom Hank's hands shaking, and from that moment you could tell this was going to be a stellar performance from Tom, and he certainly didn't disappoint. Because he was just playing the character, he was living the character. As he's attention to detail throughout the rest of the film, helps us believe that is a hero who plays a good front for his soldiers, but is as sacred, and consumed with a feeling of trepidation and fear, just like the rest of them. To conclude, cinematography, Spielberg's geniuses and Tom hanks performance, are the most vital areas that needs to be covered when reviewing a spectacular film such as Saving Private Ryan, but most Spielberg, because without his brilliance and nonchalant camera angles, Saving Private Ryan may not have ever won 5 academy awards, or never would have become a modern classic, as it unfortunately came after the superb likes of; The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Full metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, so the academy could have thought there wasn't another worthy story to come out of a War film due to the amazing stated, but Steven breaths ingenuity and intelligent filmmaking, to add new life to the war epic, standing up tall next to the greats of the war genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherhood is worth dying for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are "good" from beginning to end and their relationships are "good" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plot lines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.The good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.The actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue whether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.The bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?The ugly. Nothing.The result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest upsets in Oscar history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's epic World War II film (from 1998) earned him his second Academy Award for Best Director although it failed to win best picture (being robbed by 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE') in one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history and certainly my lifetime (next to maybe 'CRASH' beating out 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' in 2006). It's still considered one of the greatest and most realistic war films ever made though, being praised most of all for it's opening 27 minute 'Normandy Landings' scene (which was named "best battle scene of all time" by Empire magazine). It's one of my favorite war and Spielberg movies ever and probably my favorite film of 1998!The film was written by Robert Rodat and inspired by a monument, memorializing soldiers killed in battle from the Civil War to Vietnam, which lists eight siblings killed in the American Civil War. 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' revolves around a soldier, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's three brothers are all killed in World War II. In order to relieve distress to his mother Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), orders eight soldiers to find Ryan and bring him home to safety. They're lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who just survived the Normandy Landings. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Vin Diesel play the other seven soldiers. The film was criticized by some, including filmmaker Oliver Stone, who felt movies like it helped influence the Iraq War (due to World War II being portrayed as 'the good war'). I don't really agree with that assessment but I can see their point. The movie is a masterpiece in my opinion and I think everyone should see it as a tribute to all the soldiers who've died in war. The first time I saw it in the theater was one of the most memorable film going experiences of my life. Who could ever forget those opening 27 minutes (it portrays one of the most nightmarish images ever caught on film)! I think this movie is Spielberg at his very best (in my opinion it's a greater achievement than 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' even). To say I like it more than his more fun movies like 'JAWS', 'E.T.' or the 'INDIANA JONES' series would probably be a lie but it is a more important film and one of the very best of 1998 (definitely better than 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE').Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Knowing that I have seen Schindlers List and Citizen Kane, that is a bold statement. But, this movie is filled with complex statements about men at war. It goes beyond an antiwar film. War isn't just hell in this movie. It isn't just brutality and violence. It is about the toll on the soul, the burying of identity and the hope that it will be for a reason. It is about the bartering of war. One man you knew for twenty people you will never see. More over, at its core, this isn't even an antiwar film because the film is searching for something that will justify the bloodshed, justify the absurdity of these soldiers situation. War is hell unless something good comes from it. The acting is on point and many of the characters serve a distinct purpose in the screenplay, which is extremely well written. There are symbols that register without thought and the speeches delivered serve to add to the absurdity surrounding the soldiers. I doubt any filmmaker will come close to the achievement that this film is. Watch this today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered by many as the best war movie ever made and considered by most as one of Spielberg's many unforgettable classics, 'Saving Private Ryan' in its 150 minute run time tells the story of a group of soldiers who have been sent by the American government to find and recover a lone soldier after his brothers were wiped out in war.Being released in the year of 1998, when movies like American History X and Shakespeare in Love came out, it is an absolute "spit on the grave" insult that this movie did NOT win the Best Picture award, instead being handed to movies of lesser kind such as 'Shakespeare in Love' However, that being said, there is so much I simply love about the movie. The acting is great with Tom Hanks pulling off another blinder of a performance! The rest of the cast all do a great job. The writing is great, often being witty and clever and Spielberg's direction is almost perfect! What do I mean "almost" perfect? This scene is everyone's favorite scene when dealing with the movie and is regardedas a great scene but this is one scene that I do NOT hate but do NOT enjoy much either. That is the Omaha Beach scene that drags on for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of depicting what war feels like. I can understand it being 10 minutes, that would be a blast of a start but the scene really pulled me out of the movie early on but thankfully recovered after the quest had begun with such amazing scenery, brilliant cinematography and superb special effects along with some great action scenes and very emotional scenes as the movie progressed. Another thing that adds to the greatness of the movie is definitely the characters as all soldiers who were focused on in the movie were very interesting, especially Capt. Miller. Another part I enjoyed was the ending scene, though it may feel a bit cheesy and corny, I found it reasonably emotional and the scene does make you feel its worth sitting through a 170 minute movie.I can say in conclusion that this is a movie that I would easily recommend to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a classic and that it will live forever. The reason I had to drop one point off my rating is simply the 20 minute beach scene at the start of the movie which dragged on and threw me out of the movie, but I can easily tell that everyone else will love that scene. So, go ahead...Watch the movie! Great film, a classic and perhaps the best war movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... more of its kind.To all the international reviewers complaining that only Americans were shown in the movie: only the most uneducated Americans truly think no other country had a hand in toppling Hitler. The movie is Amerocentric, to be sure, but it's not about America. Personally, I would also like to see Spielberg's treatment of the RAF in the Battle of Britain as well. HOPEFULLY, a quality British director will take up that cause if Spielberg doesn't. It's not that we don't know that Europeans and especially Russians weren't essential in winning the war, it's that THIS movie is following a group of Americans. Don't like that? Make your own. I'd pay to see it. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful depiction of world war II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second favorite World War II movie after Schindler's List, which was also made by Steven Spielberg. Saving Private Ryan is captivating and also shows the whole events that war carries, the movie is well acclaimed for its graphic realistic depiction of World War II; since I wasn't there during it, if this is what war looks like?, I pray to God that there is no World War III.The movie is about a United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other soldiers under him as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen and has been ordered by the President to be brought home as his family fears losing all five sons to the war.There is just one thing about this movie that cut my attention, after Hanks character Captain John H. Miller, drags he crew through the war losing many on their way in crude ways all in the name of finding Private Ryan, they finally found him and Ryan refuses to go back with them, claiming he doesn't need saving. Miller and the remaining of his crew then joins Ryan's course. If I was Miller I would have knocked him (Ryan) up the head and drag him home.Saving Private Ryan is a War Epic film, done by Steven Spielberg, who has been involved in some World War II films before this, like Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List. To prep the guys for the film the cast except from Matt Damon were sent to a ten days "boot camp" for training and work on the film set to prepare them for their roles. The reason Damon was excluded was for the other cast to develop a form of resentment towards him, which will help in their reaction to him during filming.Critically noted for its portrayal of World War II, this film was released to a high positive acceptance and earned a whooping 11 nominations in the Academy Awards, going home with just 5, including winning Spielberg his second Academy Award as a director. The movies cinematography too has to be praised the movie shots during the world War II fight on Omaha beach is a classic to see, that scene has been noted as one of the greatest TV scenes of all time.Saving Private Ryan was also a commercial success, making more than 6 times its 70 million production cost and its home video sale was massive.This is a movie that I can bet my name on that you will enjoy, the depiction of the war sequence the sad end to lives during the war, the repercussion of cowardly behavior all added to the drama and the fun you will get while watching this war classic.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply the best war movie, bar none, so far anyway. This movie set a new standard for the film industry when it comes to recreating combat scenerios. The D-Day scene is the most brutal, realistic depiction of war ever produced. When you go to a movie (war movie or any movie) the filmmakers try to give you the sense of watching that scene play out in real time in front of your eyes, In this one though, Spielberg grabs you by the shirt, pulls you in, and makes you be a witness to the scene as it plays out.Everything about this movie was outstanding. The Cast was perfect and gave performances of a lifetime. The Effects were second to none. The photograph was mind bending. There was not a detail left unattended to. Simply perfect. This is what all movies should strive to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But There's Better B+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there are any misconceptions, I do like this movie. I find it one of Spielberg's best, one of the unforgettable period films of the 90s. With the likes of Tom Hanks, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and a surprisingly good performance from Vin Diesel (can't believe I said that?), the acting is pretty damn good. It's recreation of D-Day is probably its strongest scene by far, setting the tone perfectly: sacrifice. The many battle scenes are done without a hitch and there are great strides in the history of war film effects. John William's music is encompassing and well done, not one of his best but still very good.I have but a few problems with the movie. One, its moral quandary is supposedly the sacrifice of many for one. However, the question honestly seems self-defeating. Why, you probably ask. Because the movie seems to seal this moral lesson in quite frankly one of the most obnoxious characters ever: Upham, played by Jeremy Davies . I'm not sure what the point of his character was. For some time he's a morality tale lifeboat who boast about the indecency of killing soldiers who surrender, fine and dandy, living up to the codes of conduct and what not. However, during the big finale, this character proves to be little more than a coward who's failure to act cost the lives of many. And I know, I know, it in a way simply portrays tragic irony and the confusion battle brings. But the end result, with Upham finally doing what he should've done in the first place seems, dare I say, pointless. After the whole movie seemingly supporting mercy, what was with the sudden redundancy of the message? It seemed the majority of the characters died for reason not even our film makers understood or mixed up.I've been told this is what you call a 'pro-war' movie, and to an extent it is. All in all, despite its mixed up morality, the film is still one I enjoy though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular; raises the bar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently wrote a review on The Thin Red Line, Terrence Malick's war epic that was badly timed and unfortunately forgotten. In that review, I mention how it was released around the time of Saving Private Ryan, the "best war film known to man". So, I stand by that.Saving Private Ryan is the story of a group of soldiers, led by a captain played by Tom Hanks, one of his best performances, who are sent on a mission during WWII to bring home Captain James Ryan(Matt Damon), a soldier who is unaware that his three brothers have died in combat.The film has such a great story, and it really brings us into the action and into the character's states of mind. Yet, it is three hours long. But for me that three hours just flew by. Steven Spielberg went home with an Oscar for this film, but the film lost the best picture award to Shakespeare in Love, a wonderful film that isn't as good, to be honest.The cinematography is marvelous, and the action sequences are riveting. The acting is something that I cannot leave out either. Saving Private Ryan is a captivating and sad film experience that really makes you feel for the characters, and makes you feel a longing to be home.Spielberg's film is spectacular, remarkable, and definitively unforgettable. A filmmaking spectacle on the grand scale. This is one of his best works, probably on his top five. You definitely have to see this at some point or another.A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all the nominations for Best Picture in 1998 at the Academy Awards I'm still baffled how this one isn't the movie to take home the statue. Instead you have some lame Shakespeare in Love get that honor that no one in this century even remembers. You don't see SiL getting re-played on cable all the time like SPR does. You don't have a great half hour opening scene like in SPR with the Normandy scene which is one of the best scenes in motion picture history.Spielberg and Hanks with this and then followed up with the miniseries Band of Brothers and The Pacific basically reinvented what a depiction of war should look like on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg's 1998 war movie about the story of a group of men setting out to find the last surviving brother in a family of four is timeless. Tom Hanks plays the lead of Captain John Miller, a schoolteacher and supporting roles are given to Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon and Edward Burns among others who all act very well. The opening battle scene is my favourite movie scene, completely capturing the horrors of not just World War 2, but every other war as well. Furthermore, Spielberg accurately captures the soldier's emotions in the war, an aspect some war movies lack. The audience is able to put themselves in the soldier's shoes very easily, particularly in the scenes comprising of American deaths. I found this film excellent and I hope anyone else who watched it did as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan: Truly A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath in this movie,Saving Private Ryan.The story,written by Robert Rodat,is loosely based on the real-life case of the Niland brothers.It features Tom Hanks as U.S. Army Captain John H. Miller,together with Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg,Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon as Private First Class James Francis Ryan,a paratrooper who is the last surviving brother of four servicemen.The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name "Ryan" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall, learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan, be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham, skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath, plus privates Mellish, Medic Wade, cynical Reiben from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo, and religious Southerner Jackson, an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier.Saving Private Ryan develops into a powerful and potent portrayal of men at war.It sets a new benchmark for realism in World War II films, and defined war movies for a generation. A film of scope and vision rarely experienced, its award-winning cinematography and sound editing helped convey the blood-chilling images that presents war as violent,harrowing, and horrific.Aside from that,it also presents a soul especially with the characters involved.The cast provided brilliant and excellent performances especially from its lead star,Tom Hanks.And definitely,Spielberg was masterful in his direction of the film as he sends an anti-war message but not to the point of condemning patriotism and love for one's country and countrymen.Truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. Our world has taken a turn for the surreal".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, "Saving Private Ryan" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late-90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres. Saving Private Ryan was one of them (the other, unfortunately, was The Matrix). Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' cliché.Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clichés, but don't judge SPR for it.The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically amazing, but the story is just okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't seen this one since it played in theaters. I didn't think all that much of it then. It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question "Is it worth it?", but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding "DUH!" Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs. I'd guess that Saving Private Ryan has done more to recruit new soldiers than any Army of One commercial ever has.So, yeah, it misses several of its main aims. However, while you can castigate Steven Spielberg for misunderstanding his context, you can't say a thing bad about his technical work on the film. Sure, the hand-held aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years (try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of Gladiator), but it was pretty brilliant at the time, and it really puts you right there. War might be fun, but it's also damn scary, and I found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film (I try to forget the Arlington sequences exist) finally comes to an end. The slower, more personal moments aren't the best (partly due to the variable cast, which ranges from fantastic (Jeremy Davies) to acceptable (Tom Hanks) to terribly annoying (Edward Burns and Paul Giamatti)), but they're mostly fine, and always beautifully shot. I love some of the smaller moments of the movie, especially the slap that the little French girl gives her father when the G.I.s are able to hand her back to him, after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence. All in all, while the film is kind of a mixed bag, I do think that the impressive moments far outweigh the overall ponderous nature of the movie.</fullReview>

We just may call this another typically silly Tom Hank's early age's movie that many have come to love at first sight.Simply put, this movie is all about funny situations and the comical performances of Tom Hanks and the dog (that dog was a great actor!).

		<fullReview>Realistically, if Saving Private Ryan, a masterstroke even by Spielberg's standards, is renowned for anything to the unfortunate global margin who have not yet witnessed its awesome might, it is the opening battle scene at Omaha Beach. In a graphic, unflinching and intelligently crafted 24 minutes of intense combat, Hanks' Captain Miller attempts to lead a scattered battalion up the Normandy dunes where the German's have strategically set up a prime and virtually impenetrable defense, made up of turrets and other artillery which they fire unceasingly at the landing soldiers. This sequence has been lauded, justifiably, as possibly the most realistic, not to mention enthralling, WWII battle scene ever made. A nonstop, action-packed spectacle of epic proportions, this opening absorbs the viewer to the extent that the experience becomes a predominantly visceral one, where everything on screen is felt rather than seen or heard. When the soldiers begin to yell military jargon to each other amidst their chaotic surroundings, much of which is either inaudible or incomprehensible, the instinctive understanding between the characters and the viewer is mutual: "We're getting shot at, so shoot back? harder!" During these times when the characters take time to stop and confer with one another, it is refreshing to see Spielberg defy war- movie convention by not also causing the turmoil around them to cease: many a soldier is cut off mid-sentence by an unfortunately aimed bullet/mortar shell. And, as if positioning the camera in amongst this pandemonium would not suffice, Spielberg goes to great lengths to ensure that the audience feels not only like a spectator to this event but a borderline participant; techniques such as allowing a free-fall of water and blood onto the camera and the incorporation of a smouldering grainy effect on the lens that seems to elongate and redefine every stroke of light and colour on screen add to the experience.Spielberg's meticulous attention-to-detail is a distinctive aspect of his directing style that informs much of the Omaha Beach landing as there's a strong notion while watching that every one of the hundreds of extras on screen is briefed on the scene as fully as possible, being instructed on precisely when and where to shoot, scream, fall, die etc. This, amongst other Spielberg traits, is the mark of a brilliant director and a quality that no doubt won him his second Best Director statue, along with his uncharacteristic choosing of such mature subject matter as in his previous win for Schindler's List five years earlier.Saving Private Ryan is, at its foundation, a thrilling and rewarding film that succeeds in exhilarating the audience and fulfilling the needs of any adrenaline junkies who happen to be watching. What sets the film apart from a vast category of movies that also achieve this merit is that when the action stops the viewers interest doesn't. This is attributed to the snappily flowing and probable dialogue that never degrades itself enough to be necessary; if any quality of a film is ever more appropriately ordained necessary as opposed to entertaining, rest assured it definitely could've been better. Granted, everyone could have gone without Hanks' speech about the horrors of war and his longing for home, the only truly disingenuous moment of the entire film, manufactured solely for usage at awards ceremonies as a short to accompany Hanks' nominations. But this single scene, try as it might, thankfully does not derail the rest of the film's engaging, at times funny and insightful script; in fact, in being surrounded by such brilliance, Hanks' monologue even becomes somewhat endearing with repeat viewings.Saving Private Ryan, a gem in its own right, is heightened to further planes of excellence by a cast of great variety and, at the time, predominant obscurity, with the exceptions of Hanks, Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Nevertheless, each and every one of the mainly young and inexperienced actors that make up Miller's unit are given a chance to prove themselves worthy of their time on screen: modern day action hero Vin Diesel's dying Caparzo pleading for one of his friends to shelter a letter for his father; the eerily captivating Ribsi's Wade speaking of his long-tempered guilt at having deceived his mother; Davies' Upham silently crumbling into a self-loathing, hysterical mess, unable to summon the courage to shoot an enemy soldier; virtually anytime that Goldberg's Mellish and Pepper's Jackson speak, with their casual humour, stoic sorrow and startling arrogance that is as involving as any other character. Ed Burns as Reiben, the largest supporting role, initiates the first of what has resulted in a typecast career and a slew of hardened, defiant, almost "bad-boy" roles. He shatters this façade only once to speak of a beautiful and, most pertinently, curvaceous woman he knows back home whom he thinks of whenever he finds the war around him too much to bear. Sizemore is walking familiar ground as the toughened and ripened authoritarian support, but at least there is a dimension to his character, unseen in the ill-fated Pearl Harbour. Matt Damon in the brief role of Private Ryan is outstanding in his ability to connect with the audience, especially the anecdote he tells involving his three brothers, persuading surprisingly comfortable laughter and a touching sense of loss. Tom Hanks' fine portrayal of Captain Miller is a truly original character in which there is no hint of the tender Forrest Gump or the jaded but honest Charlie Wilson; Miller is a testament to Hanks' wide and impressive spectrum, which is made abundantly clear anyway by virtually every film he appears in.An audience-pleasing endeavour that offers as much excitement as it does quaint and unexpected intimacy, Saving Private Ryan is a war film that never seeks to glorify itself, but rather acknowledge that great things can sprout from even the sh*ttiest situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thank you to all veterans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, I knew that my family had a lot of history in the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. My grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the Pacific, and my grandmother's brothers were Marines alongside them. My grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there, and he always just bowed his head, swallowed hard, and told half truths and "beside-the-point" stories to appease whoever asked- never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow Americans were- heroes.I had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldn't talk about WWII, but one day in my U.S. History class in high school I got my answer. This film opened my eyes to the horrors of war. I sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me, wondering how soldiers and Marines like those in my family lived- or whats more, were able to cope with the events that made them heroes.My point with all of this is that in this day and age, we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we don't really realize what fighting men go through in times of war. We see "10 soldiers killed in Iraq" on the news, but it doesn't really register to us as civilians. This was Spielburg's goal in making this film. He wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us- you and me. Every American Citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safe.As far as the film itself goes, it is absolutely amazing. No film is perfect, but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles. The emotion is there, the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt, the best war movie ever made.One thing to note is that this is NOT a film for your kids or a film to watch casually. It is intense and should be treated as such.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is really one of the most realistic and moving war movies that I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film 2 weeks ago and I've never forgotten this dramatic film. It's not only a normal World War II film movie but a movie with a very moving story and many impressive scenes. It's a mus seen film because you really can imagine that you were accompanying the search troop which was looking for James Ryan. Some parts are filmed with hand cameras which have the effect that you're much more on the edge of your seat and thus it takes the character of a realistic documentary film. But also the typical war music makes you feel some shivers. With the actor Tom Hanks as captain John Miller you see a convincing major who plays his role as if he had never been doing something else. Personally I think that this is the best and most dramatic war movie I've ever seen. It really pushes you to think about the situations in war and about the army and all this stuff. I recommend ?Saving private Ryan" to everyone who likes war movies with partly true and impressive stories and who isn't scared if he sees sometimes some blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admirable work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire this film on many levels. The acting is absolutely superb especially the performances given by Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon and all the supporting actors as well as the other leads, I don't have preferences but I only mention these off the top of my head. The direction by Spielberg is confidant and calm when it needs to be but also ferociously intense when there is a need for it. For every explosion and gun-fight there is a quiet moment between the characters which is just as worthwhile if not more and Robert Rodat's screenplay is pitch-perfect. Janusz Kaminski is one of the finest cinematographers alive and he brings the story alive in exquisite detail. The first twenty-minutes which show the famed D-Day landings is one of the most spectacular and haunting pieces of footage ever caught on film. There are many reasons I love the film but what brought the film down for me was essentially the story. There was no lack of it or too much of it and it was interesting but when Spielberg is fighting for believability in these shots I did not believe it with the story as a back-drop. The story goes that after Damon's brothers are killed around the globe on the same day the army wants to send him home to his mother and sends a group led by Hanks to find him and send him home. While something that is decent. I'm sorry but the government is not that decent and I didn't believe it for a second which constantly brought the film down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg shines in brutal and emotional war picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of U.S soldiers cross enemy territory to take James Ryan (Damon) home to his mother, who has already lost 3 sons.Steven Spielberg's brutally honest war drama tells the story of a brave and emotionally uplifting idea of family that exploits the nature of the Second World War in a highly realistic and flinching manor that has won over fans all over the world.The Jaws director instantly sets off by cementing the main characters at the heart of the battle of Normandy. This opening battle is a mark of true leadership from Spielberg. You simply have to look and see the vast collection of people, main actors, extras, stunt doubles all crowded together to see the work and effort put in by the man and it all works in perfect synchronization to create a devastating feel of realism. The silence of no music and the cries from soldiers and shouts of orders and heavy breathe give this opening a very eerie feel, a necessity to make the feel of the film, which continues uninterrupted throughout the entire duration.The action sequences of this 1998 release are the key element to its realism. The use of various weapons, the direction of tanks and boats all comes together to create a hardship for the script and emotional feel of battle.The script adds a great sense of drama that coincides with the film's ambitious outlay. The inclusion of emotional soldier sub stories adds an extra dimension to the already dramatic element of the Second World War. Matt Damon's ad lib for his brother's spying game is a fine example of the emotional core at the heart of the situation. Other elements including friendship and family are well included and portrayed.The story itself a story within a bigger story is great. This rescue attempt to save Private Ryan included numerous twists, shocking action montages and a battle of personalities withstanding emotion that gives this film a true sense of realism in context, justifying what it would truly be like going to war and dealing with unthinkable consequences.Tom Hanks leads strongly from the front and though not his strongest role gives a fine leading performance, inspiring the likes of other soldiers in his group to follow suit. Matt Damon as ever is perfect whilst the religious side story to Barry Pepper's protagonist is perfectly emotional and balanced with other sub stories.Spielberg's direction extends to more than just big battle montages. Such as the shot of a hand through dying eyes, the emotional core of doing the duty, the high shots from towers, the character recognition, the director has created something utterly remarkable.At times the film can slow down a little too much and is quite long but then the relevance is significant of the true battle, as with the filming. The shaking camera and unsteady feel with the colour ratio changing adds spice and a uniqueness to make a groundbreaking and deserved Oscar winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A necessary lesson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't summarise the film or talk about its technical and artistic brilliance. It is a brilliant film which depicts WW2 as it was, not the sanitised versions we were used to seeing from the 50s onwards. But, to me, there is a more important lesson to be gained from this film...I went to see this film in a suburban cineplex here in Australia. On the night there was a huge audience and a large group of teenagers who'd wandered in because the film they wanted to see had a full house (I overheard them saying this...). They were boisterous and noisy and sometimes obnoxious as kids can sometimes be at cinemas. But after the first five minutes of the film they were dead silent and they remained so for the rest of the film.I looked at their faces as they exited the theatre at the end of the film. All were ashen-faced, drained...some clearly close to tears. I was happy about this because a film had hammered home to a bunch of modern kids the reality of war without them having to experience it first hand, thank God. All at once they learned that war is horrible, sometimes necessary and best avoided. I'm sure they learned to look at the elderly survivors of this time in human history with a new-found respect. In short, they grew up considerably and without any physical pain as a result of watching this masterful film. And for that, I thank Spielberg profusely. Bravo, Sir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely a top notch movie. I personally think it is a top 20 film of all time. The acting was exceptional, the special effects where exceptional and the plot was not bad at all. Very realistic! I liked how Tom Hanks portrayed a common man ( before the war) and came to be a very uncommon man during combat. If we look back at the Greatest Generation valor was common to many American sailors, airman, marines and soldiers. The intensity of combat ...or better yet the intensity and urgency of the mission to bring the last son out of France (Combat) kept a tension built up. All around classic and rare film. This film "hit on all cylinders".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is the best movie, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have heard some reviewers say the Germans are treated like they were born to die. That is definitely not true. In the beginning, they show multiple scenes in which the Americans shoot surrendering Germans out of cruelty. They show the sniper in the tower, show forgiveness as he was about to shoot Caparzo (Vin Diesel) in the head. German also at the end of the movie, showed forgiveness to Upham and walked past him even though Upham was actually armed. OK, now to the movie. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is very disturbing and graphic but it isn't bloody to be bloody. It has a purpose behind it, and that is to show what soldiers had to go through at one point. The scenes in the beginning with the beach was disturbing. The hand to hand combat knife scene at the end of the movie was revolting, yet it demonstrating what hand to hand combat is in war. You will do anything to live, even if you have to kill someone like they do in the movie. OK, just simply put, this is the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Prive Ryan One Of The Best War Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made period. From the intense harrowing opening battle sequence to it's explosive yet touching climax, Saving Private Ryan grabs hold of you and never lets go. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg brings this movie to the big screen and he continues to prove that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood today. With a great cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Vin Disiel a relatively unknown at the time (in a small role) all turn in terrific performances. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the film. It's one of those movies you should see without knowing too much about it because that only enhances the experience. The battle sequences are jaw dropping, hard to watch at times, and realistic giving audiences a look at what these courageous men went through back then. The running time of 170 minutes did make the movie feel a little slow at times but thats a minor flaw and the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of Spielberg, the cast, or war movies than you'll love Saving Private Ryan. It's one of those films that can be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War As It Is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see certain movies like Rambo, Commando or Predator, you see a warrior going out in the jungles and taking the whole enemy army down single handed! The truth is that while such movies are good in their own right because they allow you to escape into a world of fantasy, the movies are misleading because war is nothing like what is shown in them. You do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex. You do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other. Those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords. But modern warfare is all about luck. You survive only if you are lucky that of all the thousands of bullets and debris flying around, not one strikes you or even if it does, it strikes you in a way that it does not kill you. Nobody goes into a war without fear. Nobody remembers a country when fighting a war. All that matters is survival - survival at all costs. And that is the true picture of war that Saving Private Ryan manages to show so beautifully.The movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the Ohama beach war. It is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence. It is so realistic and will forever dispel the notions of any exuberant youth who thinks that war is glamorous. There is nothing glamorous about war and there never ever will be. I have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie. And so I must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore, pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequence.Spielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man - Private Ryan who has already lost three of his brothers to the World War operations. An order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers. How does the team assigned feel about it? Needless to say, they are grumbling about it but as we should know, a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in reality.For any person, this movie is a must-watch. It is a must-watch for many reasons. You must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in World War II. It will remind you that war should indeed be the last solution that a nation must resort to. It will remind you that there is no honor and glory in war. There is only one thing - miserable death. This movie will prove to be a life-changing experience for most people. It might even leave you with some sleepless nights. Yet, it remains a movie that I believe one must watch in his lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant movie even if too violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time and, as occurs when I first see a film, I quickly check IMDb to see what the Haters and Lovers of the movie say in their reviews. First, the Haters.Any time any movie portrays America as savior of Europe in World War II, the result gets panned by these groups (and if they're not yet organized, they should be as they deserve each other): (1) America haters from any country, notably (a) Germany ("we weren't ALL bad") or (b) the UK ("we carried the burden until the tardy self-interested Yanks decided to enter war, which by the way was almost won when the US came in"), and (2) hard leftists everywhere (how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me). Hey Germany! You WERE bad! Hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the German electorate, only too happy to see the Jew (and the occasional Bolshevik) blamed for everything afflicting Weimar Germany. Hey UK! We love you, but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach. Pssst! You, our British cousins, had LOST the war by 1941. It was over, ended, caput, stick-a-fork-in-em done. Winston well knew how critical it was that America enter the war - which it did, and which it won. We are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the English-speaking world, but it was the English-speaking world's largest country that led the way, turned the tide and won the war. Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't. Britain was sunk and defeated, with precious little industrial capacity left - industrial might had to come from the US and Canada, but mostly the US. Saving Private Ryan isn't "propaganda" - it contains critical truths, and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two parts to this movie. The opening twenty-five minutes set a new standard for the depiction of contemporary conflict in any situation and deserve to be appraised in its own right. Spielberg was careful to invest the sequence with solipsistic moments and shots that would recur later in the film so as not to have created something too distinct from the rest of the film. No Lohengrin prelude here.The consequent film has to meet the standard Spielberg has set himself - which it does, not least in am equally praiseworthy, formally symmetrical set piece at the opposite end of the film . Inbetween is an episodic chain of events as the youthful GI squad go looking for the Ryan of the title, trying to work out if the toughest battle is to be waged against Germans or existential purposelessness.Nothing is phoned in, not a performance, not an effect, not a shot. Tom Hanks could have won a third Oscar and the five that were snapped up (direction, cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects) were indisputable. In retrospect. I just remember being so lost in thought I nearly got run over coming out of the cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The brilliantly directed, Spielberg World War Two epic, Saving Private Ryan(1998) completely redefines combat action films up until this point. Whether you are one for extreme realism, or just like to watch things blow up, this movie is the epitome of all things good and pure in war movies. There is no compromise in this film, it seamlessly joins drama and action to form a movie that mom and dad would like. It follows a rag tag but elite squad of Army rangers through their historical landing on Omaha beach in Normandy France, to their journey to find and bring home Private Ryan ( Matt Damon) of the 101st airborne. Their mission was to find and retrieve Damon, and send him back to the United States after the tragic news of his three brothers dying in combat. The army thought the loss too great for his mother to bear. However, this was a reoccurring point in the movie, is the life of one worth the lives of many? The squad leader (Tom Hanks) delivers an Oscar- nominated performance that is unforgettable while acting side by side with Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath and Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben.The movie left me wanting more war movies of the same quality, immediately recognizing the world class directing, cinematography and editing. The emotion and intensity is captured by the shaky camera shots, to the low and high angle pans of the battle scenes and really brought home with the close up of the character's grief and pain. The directing really made this film; it not only enthralled the viewer during the movie, but powerful scenes left the viewer thinking long after the film was over. No matter how I describe the intricacies that make this picture great, none do more justice and give more description than just one word, Spielberg; the credibility is in the name. Sure enough, as credit is given where it is due the movie received five Oscars three of them being Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and Best Editing (Michael Kahn). It also won Oscars for Best Effects and Sound Effects, as well as Best Sound.I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you're the ardent movie critic or just an average Joe, there is something that we can all appreciate about this film and leave with the same expression, "Wow." This piece of art is nothing less than the silver screen at its best; I give this film two thumbs up (more if I was humanly capable) and my full approval.</fullReview>

Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them. It would have been well-deserved if he won again.And what more is- A great war tale.

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie for the first time last night, The only word that can be used to describe this movie is "spectacular".I chose to rent this movie simply because of the outstanding reviews. Everyone who saw it said that it was a masterpiece, so i knew that i had to see it. I've seen plenty of war movies, some bad, some excellent. Before I move on, I have to say that this is the closest thing there is to Band of Brothers. After watching Band of Brothers countless times, my expectations for Saving Private Ryan were extremely high, but it met them in the end. The only major problem I had with this film was the fact that I had tons of trouble renting it due to me being 15 years of age.The first scene of the movie shows Ryan as an elderly man visiting an American WWII cemetery in France, and i think that the movie could have done without that scene. That scene tells you right of the bat that Private Ryan lives through the movie, and that someone close to him in the movie dies. Putting that scene aside, the first combat scene takes place on the shores of Omaha Beach, the most gruesome battle of all the beach heads. When it shows the 101st airborne preparing to hit the beaches in the boats, you almost feel as nervous as they are, and as soon as the boat hatch opens, you feel helpless, almost as if you were on the beach, left to die. The entire scene is absolutely jaw dropping, and it drags you through the beach, showing you all the hell and carnage that took place that day.The rest of the movie is very straight forward. A small group of men set out to rescue a "Private Ryan". They barely have any idea who he is or where he's located, All they know is his name, and why they need to find him. The acting is really great, and Tom Hanks was as great as I expected.But, there were a few to many conflicts between the soldiers that really shouldn't of happened, and the soldiers in the film don't realize that the Germans are people to, and they are killing Americans for the same reason they're killing Germans. But I guess soldiers back then didn't realize that either, so it doesn't matter, but it will get to you while you watch the film. Overall, this move was of course "spectacular", and it definitely deserves a purchase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually this film was brilliant, especially the first scenes on D-day. It was probably the most graphic and visually impressive war movie I've seen, but a great war movie isn't made by how good (or in a way not so good) it looks. The acting in this film was pretty mediocre and i was only interested when people were shooting each other! The script was terrible with cheesy characters and back stories that really wasn't very interesting. The plot was poor as well it may have been based on a true mission in world war 2, but it wasn't as good as it could've been if they had just simply based it on a famous battle in Normandy. This could've of been a brilliant film but it fell on some very important hurdles.</fullReview>

The story line is a heroic one, a day for all American citizens to stand up proud on veterans day 60 years on, Yet Saving Private Ryan lacks that story line that delivers on all aspects. Maybe I'm being untrue comparing a movie to a TV series, but Band Of Brothers also by Spielberg is a better fulfilling, satisfying storyline, A company of soldiers travelling from Curahee in Georgia USA to Berlin. The ones who made it, the ones who didn't. You remembered. So Saving Private Ryan has changed war films forever. Thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private RyanBy Daniel Rosado Directed: Steven Spielberg Cast: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel,Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt DamonSaving Private Ryan is movie about a captain and his men going on an unusual mission to retrieve a soldier and send him home. This movie takes place during World War II, and is quite different from other war movies you might have seen in the past.When you first see Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), he's trying to invade a beach with other soldiers dying all around him. Everywhere you look there's a soldier either being shot through his helmet or someone blowing up. Medics, such as Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), desperately try to save the soldiers, but many of them also get killed. When the first battle is finally over, you see dead men of all ages, some missing limbs, you also see the water near the beach has turned blood red.Miller and the survivors (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies) of his crew are later on given a mission to find a Private Jason Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and send him back home to his mother. His three brothers have recently died and he was the last of the Ryan boys.Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), along with the other men, feels that risking their lives, to save one man is very unreasonable. But no matter how much they complain about the mission, Miller tells them that it's their job to complete it.When they do find Ryan, (the real one) he refuses to leave. He said that his comrades were his new family and he wasn't going to abandon them. But Miller wasn't taking "no" for an answer, he decided to have his crew help Ryan complete his final assignment. All of the actors put on good performances for the movie. They really did seem like the type of people you would see go to war. And when one of them would die, you wouldn't feel like "There goes another character dying", you would really feel what the soldiers felt when they would lose a comrade.Saving Private Ryan is movie unlike any other you might have seen in the past. You really do see what the real soldiers had to endure during WWII, and why you honor them for what they did.3 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an instant classic. Everything about this movie was perfect. I could not find a single flaw in the acting, storyline, effects, etc.First, there's a perfect cast. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice to play Capt. John Miller. Tom Sizemore filled the part as Miller's "side-kick", Sgt. Mike Horvath very nicely. Edward Burns was very good as the antagonizing Pvt. Richard Reiben. Barry Pepper was great as the sniper, Pvt. Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg was good as the emotional Pvt. Stanley Mellish. Giovanni Ribisi was excellent as the shy medic, Pvt. Irwin Wade. Jeremy Davies was actually funny and good at the same time playing the clutzy, peace-loving, nervous Pvt. Timothy Upham. Even Vin Diesel gave an excellent performance as the tough Pvt. Adrian Caparzo. Matt Damon was great for the limited time he was in the movie as Pvt. James Francis Ryan.The gore and special FX were first class. Everything looked so real. It was as if they were in the actual battles. D-Day landing at Dog One was particularly gory and well made. This movie must have had one hell of a huge budget, and it payed off big time. The sound score went excellent with every scene. It really made you feel for the events that were occurring.The story was also great. Usually war movies have a pointless storyline but Saving Private Ryan proves them wrong with a story of its own. This movie was perfect, Spielberg at his best. It deserves its place on the top 250. I recommend this to war/action movie fans of all kinds. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bullets slash through the air. Everything explodes around you. Your men are getting shelled to death everywhere you look. Blood goes in your face. You lose your sanity in war. You don't know what to do, or where to go. This is SPR's depiction of Omaha Beach on D-Day 1944, and an absolutely brilliant one at that. Not since SPR has any filmmaker with any budget churned out an action scene as horrifyingly real as this film's brutal depiction of the Normandy landings. Even if for nothing else other than the first half-hour, you should still watch this film. From the moment you see nervous recruits chuck up inside the Higgins boats, you can tell you are in for a stunning action scene. Though after that the film won't ever be as intense or shocking in its action, it is still something truly special. The desaturated colours, abundance of shouting, swearing and explosions tell you one thing - this is war. Though Black Hawk Down is easily as intense as this, it just doesn't have the gritty feel of SPR and you can't exactly care about the characters. But on this, you can - they're all real people leading real lives back home - no horrible sacrifices or acts of heroism - just ordinary guys like us, thrust into a world that they didn't like and in which they knew death awaited them at any corner. I doubt anybody will ever make a war movie that will recapture SPR's dizzy heights. Flags of our Fathers didn't do the job and Letters From Iwo Jima, though it is looking promising, just isn't intended to be a box-office smash. Though SPR is full of war-movie clichés, it is far better than most movies and besides, it is hard to like a movie without an emotional or sentimental side - every film needs a heart. And the war memorial scenes at the beginning and end of the film show us what SPR wanted to be all along - a respectful homage to the soldiers of WWII. To be honest, with all the intense and bloody action scenes in this film putting us in the thick of battle, it is good to have a bit of emotional contemplation once in a while. War is brutal and unforgiving, but war is also saddening and tear-jerking - Saving Private Ryan uses both those sides to its advantage. Forget major plot twists or superbly intelligent and brilliant scripts, clever plots that lose you and amazing hero characters - realism is the place to be in war cinema. That may explain why Saving Private Ryan did so well for itself. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but can't watch again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first things first. This movie is violent. Realistically violent. That is not good for a movie. There are violent films. Then there are violent films that are unpleasant to watch. Don't get me wrong. This is a great film. But, lets face facts, you can't watch this movie more than once. It got to the point where I stood up in tears yelling at the screen "STOP IT, STOP IT!" Much glorified violence in the film which I hate. Steven Spielberg in my opinion is a very sick man. His films always feature innocent people being slaughtered in some realistic manner. Whether it be being eaten, being vaporized, or being inadvertedly blown up by a bomb. Also it messes with your head big time. You watch the death scenes and you watch the Americans getting slaughtered and your like "Yeah get those sons of b%$*&amp;*!" But then they capture the Nazi and he's only following orders. Then they kill him and you ask yourself "Well, who's the bad guy here?" Adam Goldbergs death was chilling and incredibly painful to endure. At which point I realized. He just wanted to make a violent film. After witnessing that over the top, violent, and completely unnecessary death I wondered why I was watching it.This film emphasizes the horrors of war though. This film is useful. It is a wake up call to all those conservatives who are trying to shove American customs down Iraqs throat. Our soldiers have been suffering this horrific ordeal for years and why? WWII was for a better cause. This film is a one time thing. It is a wake up call mostly. but, other than that it was graphic, realistic, and over all very painful to watch. Unless your the violent creep who gets off with violent movies. In that case go crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say clichés, I mean the stuff like the flag waving in the sun, an old man crying at the beginning, etc.When I say showing off, I am specifically showing the first portion of the Omaha Beach sequence in slow motion. That was very irritating. I want a war movie that will just throw the gore and horror at you, not one that is trying to deliver it in slow motion...that is absolutely ridiculous.Many will disagree, but that is why I am very fond of the movie Black Hawk Down...no cliques, no showing off, straight to the point.All that being said, Saving Private Ryan is still a masterpiece, and I will go as far as saying one of the best films ever made. It is realistic, it is sad, and it does work.The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the visual and sound effects are great, the cinematography is great...the movie is a masterpiece.9/10, just because of the clichés and showing off...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan easily stands as a film that is one of the most realistic interpretations of WW2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan a film that has been hailed by many as one of the most realistic WW2 drama's to date, both in its context of battle and of its initial atmosphere, few WW2 drama's are unable to capture the harrowing battle that was of WW2, but Saving Private Ryan incorporates the power that churns your stomach as minute after minute you will see soldier's being instantly blown to pieces.As you most probably know Saving Private Ryan is a Steven Spielberg film and Spielberg himself admitted that he has a self-obsession with the WW2 context, as many of his earlier films such as the Oscar scooping film Schindler's List and Empire of the Sun are typical examples of films that are to do with WW2 and by in large they have very similar elements in common with each other.Saving Private Ryan has quite an unusual storyline for a WW2 picture but it does stand out, basically after the historic D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach, a Captain who goes by the name of John Miller must go along with seven other men to search for a missing soldier known as Private James Ryan who's three brothers had been killed in combat and for most of the film you will be seeing sequences of how the men proceed to find him and what they must risk to get to him. The storyline is successful in leaving a huge impact on the viewer(s) but for the most part the storyline is not that attractive, for one thing viewers just prefer to see Saving Private Ryan for its action and realism rather than for the fictional story that has been laid out in it.But even though this film possesses a disputable story there are actually a host of notable actors in this film that do a good job of backing up the film's rather sensitive storyline, Tom Hanks gives a riveting performance as Cpt. John Miller, well as the film's main supporting actors Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and of course Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan give some very excellent portrayals of their characters in the film's premise.All throughout Saving Private Ryan is an excellent film, it includes some very realistic physics in terms of its action and the characters themselves really stand out, but unfortunately the film's storyline can be quite slow and offhanded and appears to be a little too innovative and overrated, but if you're seeing Private Ryan for the first time then the storyline might be the source that will entice you to watch it to the bitter end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good War Flick, But the Best Parts belong to the First 20 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the D-Day invasion, Captain Miller (Hanks) an his squad of seven other soldiers go through Normandy to find James Francis Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in action. As the squad searches to find Private Ryan, they asked the inevitable question, why are they risking their lives to save one soldier.Saving Private Ryan is the best film to react the D-Day landing. It is both horrific and gruesome. It really shows how the landing took place. Unfortunately, the film never gets better than the first 20-25 minutes.The plot is good and is something I have never seen before in a war film. The characters are also very good, though it seems like Speildberg just threw in every military job there is in this film. The Motley Crue includes a sniper, a medic, a linguist, and many more.The directing and dialouge is very well done. It just seems like it takes itself a little too seriously at times. It also seems like some scenes drag on a bit to long.In my opinion, Hanks does a fantastic job, as does everyone else. The only one I thought didn't act as good was Matt Damon as Private Ryan. He has a fairly short role and didn't live up to it.All in all, it is a great war film with good directing, a good cast and a good premise. Its just too bad that it dragged on a bit to long and took itself too seriously. Other than that, it is a great movie to watch if you need a war fix, just don't expect anything revolutionary in the genre.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War never produces "winners"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene alone should remind us that war never results in "winners," only the living and the dead and the traumatized and the maimed. And the Powers That Be that send them out to fulfill their agenda. Will we ever learn? This movie is a must-see for all who not only want to end war, but want to honor those who have been sacrificed and bravely died hoping to end all wars for all of us. We are reminded that while war is not honorable, human beings (both the "good guys" and the "bad guys") are, and every soldier has a home, a family, a history that is remembered by someone, somewhere. Saving Private Ryan reminds us that they should be remembered by all of us. With hope that the "war to end all wars" won't be the end of us all. Tom Hanks is his stellar self, Tom Sizemore is perfectly cast and Giovanni Ribissi (sp?) proves to be a perennially underrated gem of an actor. Thank you, Steven, for this incredibly realistic and important film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie from the standpoint of emotional trials and tribulations of war and especially WWII but no soldier or officer, in that war ever wore his rank in to battle on his uniform, helmet, flag, overcoat, automobile, never ever. The first person shot by the enemy is the one wearing rank. If you want to die quickly, wear your rank into battle. This is an old lesson learned in the War between the States. The "Pickets" snipers of that war learned quickly to shoot the highest ranks first. This rule is a very logical assumption and for the life of me I cannot figure out why a detail man such as Stephen Spielberg, of all persons, would ignore such an important detail. For me, this detail takes away much of the realism intended and I had to deal with it another way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still shake after watching this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently watched this film again for what must be the nearly 30th time, and I still find myself numb and shaking like I did leaving the theater in 1998. I remember that night every time I watch this movie, nobody spoke leaving the theater, a lot of people were crying, and I believe everyone had the sick sensation in their stomach and shaking hands I did.Personally I don't believe there has been a war movie that has ever captured even closely what it's truly like to be engaged in actual close fighting, and then came along this film. Yes, the characters are fictional but the events their story takes place in are real and portrayed as accurately as could be humanly possible to recreate on film. The action is intense, and completely realistic and sickening to imagine anyone could have endured such events and survived.I find myself crying during the D-Day invasion, and various other points during the film. Most notably when Capt. Miller sits down on the rock after they take the German nest and can't control his hands and starts sobbing. Anyone who remains dry-eyed after Ryan asks his wife to tell him he's lived a good life at the end must not have really comprehended the film.I consider this technically the greatest war film ever, the set decorations are unbelievable, the modified tanks are more than convincing, the weapons 100% the real item, and little details abound throughout the film (such as the shot surrendering soldiers during the initial invasion actually being Czech soldiers who would have been forced into the German army).Most importantly, I think this film is important to show in educational settings. Yes, it's violent. Yes, it's full of language and even shows U.S. soldiers in questionable moral situations (like shooting the surrendering soldiers aforementioned). However, if it can educate upcoming generations to what horrors war really presents to those participating, then perhaps there will be hope for mankind after all. When my daughter inevitably comes home from school one day and asks me what war is about, I plan to sit her down and show her this film, and make her watch the entire movie no matter how uncomfortable she gets.My favorite Spielberg movie, and one of in not my favorite movies of all time. I'd give it eleven stars if I could. This is one I'll watch regularly until my grave.</fullReview>

Steven Speilburg did an awesome job directing this movie. I cant say one bad thing about this movie. I was just amazed. I cant believe this isn't in the top ten of the top 250 movies. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. This film has a great cast, and a great director. The greatest war movie ever is the best movie ever made. Speilburg does a very great job at recreating the D-day scene. There is only one movie you have to see in your lifetime and that is Saving Private Ryan. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan may not be a completely accurate portrayal of the western front in WW2, but it does have something in common with its equally great descendant "Band of Brothers". What this film does is make it feel like you are there: from Omaha Beach to Ramelle.. No other film does that. Its almost as if they went back in time and filmed this; its almost 'genuine'.One of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that.Now,there are a few historical inaccuracies people have noticed (such as the Church tower in Ramelle which,according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy) but I don't think it will detract from the film. The question this film poses is if it is truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person. I think with the current situation in Israel with the kidnapped soldiers, this question has never been so apparent.So,although its not a great way to learn WW2 history,its a great way to experience it.Like many others this film got me interested in the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? This instantly became my favorite War film. No other film has done it the way Hanks and Speilburg did. It was just amazing. Even though I didn't see it in theaters I was blown away with the realism of it all. What makes this film so intense is that Speilburg filmed it himself with small one-hand cameras to give you a first person glance at the battle at hand. Even though it was nearly three hours long it was simply amazing.The plot begins after the D-Day invasion when Captain John H. Miller, Charlie company, second Rangers is given an assignment to take a squad of eight behind enemy lines to rescue Prive James Ryan, 101st Airborn, 506th, whose three brothers were killed in combat during WWII. As Miller leads his squad through occupied France, He begins to question the mission and if what there doing is worth risking the lives of his men.The reason why this movie did it for me was because its based on a true story, where you cant mess anything up or your movie is shot.I recommend this movie to mature audiences because of the intensity, and anyone who is interested in history and anyone whose not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! One of the best war movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw SPR back in April of this year in my 11th grade History class, and it stunned me. Even now I still get chills thinking of some of the scenes. The opening landing on Omaha Beach and the scene where Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) gets stabbed were enough to give me nightmares for weeks afterward.The sounds of battle were so real during the initial landing scene that I covered my ears and put my head on my desk. It was as if me and my classmates were storming the beach with the soldiers, getting shot at and shooting back.Even so, I wanted to see it again, not for the blood and gore, but for the characters. Wade was the one that I identified with the most; the kindly medic would do anything to save a soldier, even when he was already gone. The two parts that really have stuck with me are the scenes where Medic Wade and Private Mellish die, mainly because those are my favorite characters (yay for Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg!!).Wade's scene had me in tears; it was so touching how they were trying to save him. Even as he was going into shock and hallucinating, they kept up a steady flow of chatter to distract him as they put pressure on the wounds; it made me cry even more as I heard what Jackson was whispering to him as Wade was fading out of consciousness: "shhhhhh, you'll be alright, Wade? shhhhhh?". It was beautifully tragic how Jackson comforted him in his last moments, whispering to him and rubbing his forehead.And the other scene (Mellish's death) was an absolute knockout. He's fighting this German SS soldier guy, and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor. As the soldier starts to kill him, Mellish pleads for his life, and do you know what that soldier does next? HE SOOTHES HIM AS HE STABS HIM TO DEATH! "Give in . . . you have no other choice ... make it easier for both of us...the war is over for you. Shhh. Rest now... shhhhhhhh, it's easier for you this way" That one scene made me so sad and angry at Upham for being a coward and not helping Mellish that I wanted to break something.Everyone in my class thought Corporal Upham was a cowardly bastard who should have been shot when they got a chance, and I agreed with them. But I could also identify with him. He was relatively new to combat and inexperienced, scared of what he had to do. If I were him I'd be scared too.This movie has shown me what war is really like; it's hell on Earth. The glossed over Hollywood fluff of war movies of the past is dead to me. I've always been a very empathetic person, and I was warned before watching this that it would be very VERY gory, and if I needed to, I could step out and get a drink of water. I didn't leave. I watched through clasped hands, biting my lip to keep from crying; I didn't close my eyes to the horror.I would have to say that EVERY high school student in the United States should see this movie; if not all of it, they should at least watch the opening beach landing scene. Teens these days are so desensitized to violence that they don't know what real violence is. This movie will change their minds. I know it changed mine.</fullReview>

I am rarely touched by movies, but this touched me, especially the ending. Every battle scene is brilliantly played out and every actor does a brilliant job. If you haven't seen this movie, then you better get off your computer and run out and go see it. It is by far the best war movie ever made and a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks gives an excellent portrayal of Captain John H. Miller the leader of the rescue mission sent to take Private Ryan home. The fight scenes where also superb i felt like i was in an actual battle situation even though i was only wacthing it. the battle on the bridge is also great and the camera work when captain John Miller dies is excellent. Overall a great story with superb casting and i don't think i will be able to find anything wrong with it. I felt i was there and most films don't drag me in like that. Great work by Spielberg. Glad to see he has made better films than ET and Jurassic park. Try Schindlers list. superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply The Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Currently the best movie made about any war. Since its release it has been inevitably used as the standard by which other war movies are judged, including (unfairly) movies that were made decades before it.The battle scenes are horrifyingly realistic and the performances are exceptional. It is unbelievable that this film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost to Shakespeare In Love.The only criticism I have about this film is how quickly and easily CPT Miller's unit made it across the beach and up the bluff at Omaha Beach. The carnage and amount of casualties were pretty realistic, but in reality Company C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion took over an hour to reach the crest. After reaching the top they still had hours of hard fighting before any significant area was secure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Largest Amphibious Landing- His Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of bloody, horrible wars you think of Vietnam, maybe Korea. When you think of World War II, you picture Bob Hope entertaining the troops, or people back in the states dancing to Glenn Miller. Saving Private Ryan shows what World War II, the most defining war in human history, was really like. The D-Day invasion of World War II, was to decide the future of the world; fascist, or democratic. Would the world be free, or enslaved by Nazis? D DAY, NORMANDY France 1944- an American squadron is looking for a missing comrade. The movie opens with a 20- minute war sequence with Captain John Miller's unit landing on Omaha Beach, and trying to push the Germans further east to liberate Western Europe. Even though the allies win this battle, body parts and blood is everywhere. This film is full of graphic violence and gore.Then the film shifts back to a government clerical office where secretaries are typing condolence letters to the mothers who lost sons in battle. It is noticed that Mrs. Ryan of Iowa has lost three of four sons in the D Day invasion. Brought to the attention of army brass, they decide that the US army must rescue James Francis Ryan, Mrs. Ryan's only remaining son.Finding Private Ryan is like looking for a needle in a haystack for Captain Miller's squadron. At times morale is very low. You see the difference in personalities of Privates Jackson and Reiben. Jackson is a fighter, a war- monger, who doesn't care why he's there. He just wants to please his commander, and kill the Germans. Reiben on the other hand is wary, cautious, and even somewhat belligerent. About two-thirds of the way though the story, Reiben is at odds with Miller on the release of a German POW, and even threatens to go AWOL, but he along with Jackson fights with honor and bravery in the final battle.After days of searching for Private Ryan, Captain Miller's unit finally finds him guarding a strategically important bridge with a lost squadron. Private Ryan does not want to leave his troupe, considering them the only brothers he has left. This leads to a suspenseful climax.When a large German battalion spots the two American units guarding the bridge, fighting breaks out. Who will survive this horrible war? The Americans appear outnumbered. Will they be able to save Private Ryan from dying like his three brothers? Will Mrs. Ryan lose her last son in this war? Saving Private Ryan, another spectacular film by Steven Spielberg, is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It was nominated for Best Picture. Best Director Oscar went to Steven Spielberg. Art Direction and Cinematography in the film is top notch, as are the beautifully choreographed fight scenes, which are dramatic, suspenseful, and ultra-realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw it yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I posted my original comments on this film the day it first hit the American screens. I will never forget the experience of seeing this film. It was 11 a.m. on a beautiful sunny day. Me(at the time a 35 yr woman) and about 25 old men ( I am assuming many WWII vets) sat in that darkened theatre and watched this incredible film. When the lights came back on we all sat stunned and then filed out into the daylight, all of us wiping the tears from our faces, some of the men very emotionally moved and crying in their seats.My dad was a WWII radioman in the Navy, his brother was a ship commander, the other in the National Guard. When pressed, my dad would tell me some stories of his time in service. Seeing this film and the faces of those old guys in the theatre helps me understand why dad never talked too much about it. It was that devastating a film, that devastating a time.I was in another room last night, when I heard the familiar sounds of the landing at Omaha Beach coming from the living room t.v. For about the 30th time I was drawn to watch those intense opening scenes, once again drawn into the action. Just watching that first intense half hour, the bodies washing up in the blood red waves, the look in Tom Hanks eyes, the echoey silence surrounding Barry Pepper as he makes to shoot the first sniper to open Dog 1, well I was again knocked back with emotion. I again was so very impressed at how Spileberg did so much, so well in this film; from the distinctive camera work, to the small details like the drops of blood on the camera lens, to assembling the fine team of actors that brought such life to this film and such feeling for their deaths, to the incredible, adrenalized battle sequences at beginning and end, to the very simple moments throughout and the stories of the men.I just had to write again, so many years later, to say I really admire this film. It is important, not only from the perspective of film appreciation, but also for the genuine and heartfelt way it tells of one of the most important times in American history and the very brave men who sacrificed so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan Is My Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a harsh critic of movies. I bash everything. There is rarely a movie that I can sit down and watch and enjoy because most are crude and bland. I never pay attention to the hype, I don't care.I judge a movie on what it is about, what it is portraying, and how well it is made. Before I saw it, Saving Private Ryan didn't interest me. I liked dramas and war flicks and stories but I was just never interested in seeing Saving Private Ryan because of the title.One day however my mother rented the flick and I decided to watch it. Man....the opening scene was a shocker. It also really showed how that day went down. I find it fascinating how Capt. John Miller takes charge. A soldier asks him, "Where's the rallying point?" Miller responds,"Anywhere but here". I mean thats how you feel right there, like they need to get off that forsaken beach. It's neat how you get to see the characters in action on the beach before you even get into the main plot. So many different things happen in the movie. I pay attention and every time I watch it I see something new. I've probably seen it 20-30 times. I don't know why anyone would want to bash it. It is well directed, and well acted. It takes place during a time that should be well respected. It wasn't weak because it left so much of the other fighting in the war out. It is called "Saving Private Ryan", not "the Documentary of World War 2". Even though it is almost like a documentary. It's about a mission that is unlike other missions. It's about finding a soldier, and getting him the hell out of there. It's not about fighting with the British to save France and the whole Allied powers from Hitler. It was based on something smaller, but at the same time larger. A mother's love for her son, and how even in the military they respect that. We all got mothers and how terrible would they feel if they lost all their son's. even Cpt. Miller's squad was taught respect from the matter. They questioned it and some disagreed and sure they would rather be out fighting the war, but that was their orders, and they had to follow. After all, if they found Ryan, and made it out of that forsaken crap whole of a mess, maybe then they would all earn the right to go home. Anyway I would just like to say I think all the characters are great. It was Vin Diesel's best movie, I think his only good movie even though he was the first of Miller's men to die. Pvt. Jackson, I think he is many people's favorite. The way he takes down the sniper that kills Caparzo (Diesel) and battles in the Church tower at the battle for the bridge. Nothing can describe the way Tom Hanks reacts when he see's the Church tower get hit by the tank round. He feels sorrow, because of the loss of such a fine sniper, but he just keeps shooting. I like how Reiben doesn't care about the mission at first and even steps out of line. He learns what it's all about though, and he even saves Ryan at the end from a tank. Sgt. Horvath, what a great actor. Tom Siezmore. Hanks couldn't ask for a better partner. You can really feel the relationship between Miller and Horvath. Like when Capt. Miller steps out to create a diversion and Machine gun Fire rains down but Miller gets out of the way in time and Horvath says,"Captain if your Mother saw you do that she's be very upset." Then Hanks replies,"I thought you were my mother". Lol.I believe out of all the men in Miller's squad Horvath is hit by the most rounds. He showed the mentality of a brave soldier that died for his men. Obviously Upham was the sensitive type, that finally killed someone in the end. Mellish portrayed a good soldier, that did also seem a bit sensitive, as he cries while finding a Hitler Youth Knife.(He is Jewish so I guess he's not really sensitive, just effected greatly by the events because of his ethnicity) Of course Wade was also well portrayed. When he died it was the saddest. Anyway, in the end, Captain John Miller tries to blow up the bridge but a tank round launches debris and sends everything into chaos. Miller then tries to retrieve the detonator and is shot on the bridge where he falls. He then sits up and takes his pistol out and starts shooting at the tank that is about to cross the bridge. The tank explodes and in amazement Miller looks up to see the "Angels on our shoulders" P51 tank busters fly over head. Then with his last breath he says to Ryan "James, earn this.....earn it" And then it goes to James as an old man in the memorial in France with thousands of crosses. And he is of course kneeling down in front of Miller's cross with the rest of Miller's squad's crosses trying to make peace with their sacrifice for his life. James then looks at his wife and says, "Tell me I've lead a good life, tell me I'm a good man" Then She replies,"You are" And it really makes me think about how I should live, that those died to save me. That I need to be a good man, and respect what I have because so many others lost their lives, just so I could go home. To wrap it up, Saving Private Ryan had everything. Some comedy, drama, love, action, and even some good looking dames. You can't deny that James Ryan's daughter's were some good looking ladies. Anyway I didn't know a movie could be that good until I saw Saving Private Ryan. Go Stephen Spielberg!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is clearly one of the most praised war movies so far. It is an account of World War Two from the perspective of Captain John H. Miller and his squad on their mission to save one man, Private James Francis Ryan, who is the surviving brother of three. Each soldier questions the initiative and reasoning behind saving one man. Is it worth it to save man and risk the lives of many soldiers? The answer is obvious by the end of the movie. The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view with a focus on Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson, Private Mellish, Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and T-4 medic Irwin Wade. The most breathtaking scene opens with the soldiers moving on Normandy beach on 6 June 1944. The gate on the boat drops down and releases a surge of chaos. As the viewer sees three or four soldiers drown they begin to realize that this movie is taking them for an emotional ride. This scene is not drawn from pure Hollywood imagination; it is a highly accurate account of any soldier's experience during D-Day. Captain Miller and his squad are assigned to find Private James Ryan so he can go back home. Miller's squad is forced to put away all of their morals and philosophies in order to do their job. It is apparent that Miller has a different initiative at first when he's given the mission. He was promised a chance to go home and see his wife; a chance most any man would not give up, but when he actually found Private Ryan it seems that he was glad to have saved him. This is the perfect example of self-sacrifice during world war two. Not only were men and woman forced to give of themselves to save the land, but they were also forced to save each other.</fullReview>

Mr. Tom Hanks played his role like no one can, he made us feel that he is that ordinary guy, who found him self in a middle of the war, not wanting to kill any body, but his duties made him do it, and when he can let any one go, he does, he is a great actor. And the director Mr. Steven Spellberg, is a great director, I have never seen anything not good for him. All the other guys were great; I loved the sniper guy, and was very angry when he died. Excellent job for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice work Mr. Spielburg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie, rich in character development, well performed roles and topped off with a compelling theme. I LOVED the irony of eight men sent to save one.Some say the Omaha landing portrayal was unrealistic, but I'd like to see someone pull off the miracle of a better Omaha scene than SPR's. It was as accurate as film can capture that violent moment. You can either deal with that, or complain as if action is all that matters.This story is essentially about the characters (normal people in extraordinary circumstances). The war, believe it or not IS BACKGROUND. This story belongs to the nine main characters; not the entire war effort. This is why only American's are portrayed. If you're looking for "The Longest Day" setup, why don't you check out 'Cliches R' Us'? Anyhow, this is why we don't see the other allied nations in this movie. Spielburg wasn't saying "American's did all the work." The story is about soldiers who happened to be Americans. Case closed.Some argue the story is too one sided, portraying all Germans as "Dirty Animals". However, there are many segments that suggest this isn't the case. The Americans act cruel in some scenes, and Germans do the same in others. It was fair to both sides. There was nothing enthusiastic in the scene where the two German prisoners are executed. Ultimately we must remember this movie is in the American POV. When Wade and Kaparzo died, we lost two of the films main characters. Of course their death scenes were to be more emotional than that of some 'extra' playing a German.As far as flaws go, there are only two worthy of mention.In the scene where Tom Hanks takes out three men with his Thompson (a minute before he meets Ryan), the very last German dies long after the tommy gun's sound effect expires.In the scene where Jackson is in the church tower (making his final kills before he dies), he fires seven to eight shots with the Springfield WITHOUT RELOADING. The Springfield 1903 never held more than five bullets in any of its many modified models.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Best Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is probably the best war movie ever made! Everything about this film is awesome, including the acting, the special effects, and the music. What make's this film different from other war movies? It has no music when they're fighting, of course! This only makes it more realistic, and it seems like Steven Spielberg will never run out of ideas!The beginning is quite disturbing and graphic, but the special effects were amazing when they filmed it! This movie is also really sad, probably one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, but that doesn't make it bad, at all. I haven't seen many war movies, but I bet Saving Pvt. Ryan and Schindler's List are his best. I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg films, and this is my favorite of his movies. What really makes this film good are probably it's acting and special effects. Tom Hanks did an excellent job acting out John Miller in the movie, like always acting as if it was really happening. Everyone else in the film is nearly as good as Tom Hanks, and they all act like real soldiers. The special effects are what bring this movie to the top. The special effects make this movie brutal and realistic, and I've never seen a film that's more graphic.This movie is a must see. If you love Steven Spielberg films, and war movies, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"War, Gentlemen, is hell!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The above, ^, is a quote by the famous Union general William T. Sherman. Saving Private Ryan shows the hell, fog, and confusion of war. What else can I say? How about Based on a true story? It was. In the brief scene with General Marshall, where he reads a letter to a Mrs. Nieland in Boston, one signed by Abraham Lincoln, it's not General Marshall, played by Dale Dye, a former Marine captain, who's reading it. It's John de Lancie, Star Trek's Q, who's the uncredited letter reader. It opens with an older Ryan and his family at the American cemetery in Normandy. He's at the grave of Captain John H. Miller, the man who saved his life, in Normandy in 1944. So what's the message of Saving Private Ryan? Since I opened this review with a quote from General Sherman, why don't I close it with one from the Book of John? "Greater love hath no man than this: That he lay down his life for his friends." Maybe I should paraphrase the epitaph on an unknown Marine who died on Guadalcanal. "When he gets to heaven, to St. Peter he will tell: 'Another soldier reporting, sir. I've served my time in hell."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg puts us in the midst of war!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know why this is the best war film of all time? Because Spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war! We experience the unvarnished, direct, and all the nitty-gritty details that went on in battle. I can't think of any other film of the same genre which has done this. He does this by using shaky POV camera shots, showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot, brutal sound effects, etc. We also get a solid storyline with an actual plot. Our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete (besides winning the war). After a grueling 20-minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on D-Day, Capt. Miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private Ryan, a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines. His three brothers have just been killed in action and the Army wants to send him home. This leads Capt. Miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcome.Tom Hanks and company are excellent. They all give convincing and rather low-key performances. Giovanni Ribisi and Matt Damon are particular standouts. Another thing I loved about the film was the pacing. The balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect. You hardly notice that it's a 2 hr and 50 min film. The photography by Janusz Kaminski is incredibly distinctive. It has this "washed-out" look which makes it look like an old war newsreel. John Williams' musical score is also appropriately effective. It's not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for Schindler's List but good enough to appreciate. Without a doubt, all this wouldn't have been achieved if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg's expertise. Once again, he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it. I can live with the fact that the film didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadn't won for Best Director. The best war film of all time and one of the best films of the 1990's!</fullReview>

It brings to light such a sacrifice our grandfathers made that we often take for granted. I appeal to anyone who still has relative who fought in WW II to listen to their story, record it and preserve their memories for future reference.

		<shortDescription>A captivating, yet flawed, masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's war time drama Saving Private Ryan, often get's recognition as the greatest war film ever. I think that opinion is wrong, but it certainly may be the most realistically shot, hard edged war film of all time. It is a masterpiece, not without its strong points, yet certainly not without a number of flaws that prevent this from being a true classic, any which way you bend it.The story starts out with an elderly man visiting the Arlington National Cemetery, visiting his fallen comrades of 60+ years. The movie takes place around the events of D-Day, June 6, 1944, starting with a captivating and harrowing battle sequence showing us young ones, such as myself, just what it may have been like in WWII combat. The gore, violence, and cries are all very real, and little is left to the audience's imagination, we can even get a taste of what the characters are thinking and/or seeing.After the 20 minute battle sequence, we find that a boy, Pvt. James Ryan, has lost all 3 of his brothers, and by government orders, he is forced to leave combat and return home. Most of the film focuses around the troop of American soldiers who go through hell to find him.After the Normandy scene, the plot rarely really thickens, and arguably is no longer as convincing or as interesting. The script is painfully cliché and average, and there really isn't much in the way of character development. Spielberg makes the most out of what he's given, occasionally going for the visual eye candy, and occasionally slowing the pace down and attempting to give the film some serious emotional momentum.Spielberg attempts to show both sides of the war, but too often falls back on his own personal bias, attempting to cause the audience to emotionally stir and get their juices flowing, often when there's not much juice to flow and not many emotions to be stirred. Sometimes he tries to tackle the challenge of making a mountain from a mole hill. These scenes occasionally work, yet they too often feel forced and empty, such as the over done, unequivocal Allie death scenes, which try too hard to force a response from the audience's mouthes.The story takes a few jolts, and is never really predictable, despite the often clichéd telling of the going-ons, but after awhile it seems a bit two dimensional.One thing I did like was the use of the character of Ryan {until the end} as a metaphor. Spielberg uses his name as a metaphor at times for the freedom these men might never again see, freedom they might never find again. Ryan represents peace, and they just can't find it, not even amongst themselves. As I said, the film is at times visually stunning, and the acting performances really help in some cases to bring life to otherwise dead characters. Tom Hanks is riveting as usual, refusing to be held back by the dulled script.The very ending actually left me bitterly disappointed. Its not that I was appalled by the patriotic message, Spielberg is perfectly entitled to make a film that celebrates the American dream of Freedom, but I was mad that the film once again decided to tell/show us everything. That's the problem. Far too often Saving Private Ryan shows us too much, not leaving anything up to our imaginations. As a war film, it should show us a lot, but the overall messages in the film are whetted down by further scenes that could have worked better if they had remained out of the film. The ending could have worked on several different levels, but instead Spielberg almost tarnishes the would be message of the film, by showing an emotional 5 minute end scene with elderly Ryan and his family. I was a bit disappointed with what Spielberg left, or rather didn't leave, up to us, the audience to decide for ourselves. The film is at times guilty of shoving attained beliefs down our throat. But Saving Private Ryan still has plenty of good, heartfelt moments that interlude over the bad, and for that it still works as a movie, but certainly suffers from several near fatal flaws.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wartime Grit with an Unlikely Premise ? 8 (Very Good)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Academy Award Winning Best Picture of 1998 contains the grittiest, most graphic war scenes I've ever seen on film. On top of that, the film quality is pristine and the high-speed equipment used to shoot the movie is nothing short of groundbreaking in the war genre. That being the case, does the artistic quality of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN automatically overshadow/surpass the other movies of 1998 like American History X or Run Lola Run for example? Perhaps so.Still, as I attribute the entire 8 stars to artistic merit, the last two gaping empty stars must be addressed. The premise that the movie is based upon, namely the mission of bringing back one soldier to his mother mandated by the war department, is simply something I cannot swallow. What's the word I want to use to describe how I feel about the impetus for the movie? It's not cheesy, nor is it saccharine. I feel as if it's an insult to my intelligence. Let me spell this out word for word...First of all, I simply don't understand why history has been racked with so many wars. I'm not rabidly anti-war per Se. I just want to understand why the people of one nation collectively want to kill the people of another nation. IMDb is not the place to discuss such issues at length, so let's assume for now that wars are fought for any of a million reasons: defense, propagation of freedom, power, resources, territory, maybe the utter lack of something better to do.Now here is my gripe with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which otherwise is a masterpiece. If the war department is focusing all of its energy and machinery on the above mentioned war objectives, is it plausible for them to really care about one kid or his mother? I am curious how the parents of American soldiers killed in Iraq feel when they watch this movie. I just cannot for one second believe that the American defense department would go to such lengths for any single individual.Rather than swallow this implausible premise hook line and sinker, I would more enjoy a film that exposes the real modus operandi behind bloodthirsty war machinery. Platoon or Apocalypse Now are considered classics, and rightly so given the grimy mood each depicts. But despite is technologically phenomenal production, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is too heavy with the flag-waving patriotic Dreamworks score and tells a story you'd only find off the shelves of Disney Corporation -- one that is sugar-coated at the core and just plain fantasy.JYjimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-executed, but essentially flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visceral and engaging film, with powerful battle scenes, that presents a factually- and emotionally-biased view of the war. It's a polished endeavour, worth watching, but it loses marks because Spielberg just *has* to patronise the audience by showing Ryan as an old man. Had he not done so, I think that the movie would have been far more effective as both a creative endeavour and a moral message.The film is clearly designed with the American public in mind - there are no British or other Allied forces at all in the movie, and the French civilians and German soldiers are essentially stereotypes. The film itself is both well-scripted and -cast, but I can't help but feel that its protagonists are essentially precisely deployed character-types designed to elicit set emotional responses in the audience. The lack of emotional ambivalence in its story and characters lends a sense of superficiality to the whole affair that makes the picture, in my mind, remarkably forgettable.I would say that the movie is a fine example of Hollywood product. It has all the necessary elements of a classic film. However, scratch the glossy surface and I think one will find a disappointing lack of depth and a disappointingly familiar lack of respect, on Spielberg's part, for the audience's ability to think for itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this movie. While it is clearly one of the better WW2-movies to come out the last decades it must still be one of the most overrated films ever.A small group of soldiers set out to find a paratrooper, private Ryan, who has landed behind enemy lines in Normandy. The reason is that Ryans brothers have all died in the war and now the army will try to bring Ryan home so that at least one son in the family can be brought home to his mother alive.I said in the beginning of this review that this movie is overrated. And i stand by that comment. This movie has received a rating of over 8 here on IMDb which i think is preposterous. What this movie has that makes it very good (although not great) is the battle scenes. They are simply the best i have ever seen. The adrenaline rush, the shaky close-ups, the gore. Seldom has the complete terror of battle been captured this well. Those scenes are worth a rating of 10. But the rest of the movie? That is where the problems begin. Because the story is rather dull and unbelievable. And the pace is at times very slow. But more than anything the characters disturb me. They act like idiots. I don't know if the soldiers in World War 2 acted this stupid, or if this is some strange addition by director Steven Spielberg.My point in the end is that this movie contain great elements, but they alone do not make this a great movie. When all is said and done i give this movie a rating of 6, that could have been 8 if the story had been stronger and the characters more believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst war films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still don't understand today, why this film got such excellent reviews.'Saving Private Ryan' was one of the worst war films I have ever seen in my life. This film had no proper storyline and plot, as it was a load of Hollywood Hype that tried to come across as deep and dramatic, but in actual fact, was shallow and disappointing. What was the point of all those soldiers dying in Combat, only to find/save one soldier, and that when they found him, he didn't want to come back home with them. Yes, this film had its dramatic scenes, like at the beginning of the film when old Private Ryan was crying at his friends gravestone, but even the way that scene was portrayed, I found it was corny and melodramatic. Overall, this film completely dragged-on, as it had bad editing, a pathetic dialogue and had a terrible conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not without faults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, of course, a popular film. I happen to own this DVD, but at the same time there are only a few scenes that stick out as spectacular in the genre of war films. The few well done battle scenes were the reason I bought this, but some of the glaring faults are what would lead me to give this film a 7 out of 10, rather than 10 out of 10 as productions like Black Hawk Down and even Band of Brothers deserve.First, one of the most obvious problems with the film starts right in the opening scene. We see all these dirty faced, rugged looking men on their way into what is certainly the scariest moment of their lives. Then suddenly we see baby-face Tom Hanks with his smooth skin clean shaven and groomed like the son of a politician. It creates a contrast right there in the opening scene that is disruptive to the mood and becomes disruptive later on in the film as well. Don't get me wrong. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but he looked 100 times more rugged in Castaway as he did in this film.Secondly, was Vin Diesel. OK, so people like him. Don't get me wrong here either. I'm not going to claim that he lacks intelligence outside of his films, although I know he did drop out of college but that's not relevant. However, in his films it seems like he always plays characters who don't display an IQ higher than 70. I'm not so sure this is how the characters were written as much as it is how he plays the roles. His acting is unnatural, stiff, forced, and lacks realism. He just comes off idiotic in all of his movies. He became known in the film world for a film he wrote and directed, I believe. Maybe he should try his hand at that instead of trying to be the next Arnold Swartzenegger, because he's not buff enough and he's too awkward as an actor to play that role.Third, as I said before, the film has some great battle scenes, which is why I bought the DVD, but we have these moments that would best be described as superficial moments in the film. For example, these moments that seem like they are in place only to demonstrate Tom Hanks witticism, or moments that make the Nazi soldiers like idiots. Those scenes seemed unrealistic and annoying. Contrast this with Band of Brothers and you'll see what I mean. It's a serious film. Not a film that requires moments of dry humor. Spielberg dropped the ball on those aspects of the film.Good film, but as a war film, not nearly as good as Band of Brothers, Platoon, or Black Hawk Down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The review by our Finnish friend stated that "Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis".Now, one certainly can't argue that Americans (like EVERY nationality in history) committed war crimes. And it's true that there was segregation and we interred the Japanese. But to compare America to Germany which tried to invade and enslave several countries and put to death millions in death camps as well as other cruelties???And SAVING PRIVATE RYAN didn't show Americans as perfect. I recall scenes of GI's shooting un-armed Germans trying to surrender. Another scene showed a GI telling his comrades not to shoot the Germans set afire by a flamethrower to put them out of their misery plus Upham's cowardice.......where in SPR are Germans shown in a poor light??? Steamboat Willie had his life spared and rejoined the German Army...was he supposed to say "Sorry, I promised the Americans I would sit out the rest of the war". The sniper shot Carpazzo....was he not supposed to shoot an enemy? And Carpazzo was not holding the child at the time so it's not like the sniper was trying to kill a child...so tell me where Germans were made to look evil and Americans were made to look perfect in SPR???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an American film about a particular incident surrounding one US soldier. We all know many participated in the liberation of Europe and Asia but every film doesn't have to be a mix. I wonder how many foreign films give the US any or much credit for the enormous contribution it did make when the sleeping giant was aroused. I remember seeing The Longest Day in Germany in 1963, in a German theater, funny thing was the audience cheered at the wrong times. The paratroopers landing in St Mere Eglise, for example, were cheered when they were being slaughtered. And please, don't tell us what a genius Montgomery was, that war would still be waging if all the generals were like "ol Monty" trying to get his act together. I won't even go into the brilliance of the US 3rd Army manuvering in battle to relieve Bastonge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm trying to respond to the German/foreign criticism some of which I share some of which I don't.Prior to world war 2 the American army was the 35th largest in the world - the same size as the Portuguese army. So the American soldiers were civilians in uniform, a kind of partially trained militia. American foreign policy was based on an improvised garbled theory of collective security with the British empire (!?) and the Soviets (!?)The German army was a professional force indoctrinated from a young age to become part of a military caste and to conform to a totalititarian ideology of revenge and conquest.It is frankly easier to understand the psychological condition of the German soldier- he had been thoroughly trained to obey. I don't think that the American soldiers died for the sake of France, I don't think that they died for sake of collective security, or capitalism (or keynesianism) or "the flag." I think they died the same way a firefighter will die evacuating an occupied building. No one has the right to attach an cock-eyed ideological significance to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Saving Private Ryan" almost immediately finds our main character-- not Private Ryan--but Captain John Miller, along with hundreds of soldiers, storming Omaha Beach in France on June 6, 1944. In the chaos of invading France, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned the task of locating paratrooper John Francis Ryan (Matt Daman) to return him home. We follow Captain Miller and his seven chosen comrades (Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, among others) through an impossible, and sometimes deadly, mission amidst constant battles, as they ask themselves: 'How many men should die to save one?' Every soldier quickly learns when given an order, it is not yours to ask why. This film challenges that military decree from its early scenes of horrified boys facing the unknown in the storming of Omaha Beach to the late scenes of men facing death during this questionable mission. The film serves as a jolt, giving a visual to put with the loss of lives read about in history books. Saving Private Ryan also compares the loss of one mother to the sacrifice of eight others.Occasional slow and lengthy dialogue, although used to introduce our characters personally, is the only downfall of this film. The effects in this movie are most notable. We are participants in the battles, as the camera jerks nervously, and bullets scream by our ears. Just as powerful is the painful mute silence coupled with the slow motion as we witness particularly excruciating scenes, as if we are falling unconscious. The symbol of a trembling hand stilled only by death, and the close up of a characters eyes as he ages or even changes into another character, give personality to lives lost, and lives saved. The repeated use of the 'death letter' we see removed from many dead soldiers' breast pockets are accompanied by a stories of who are to receive the letters and their significance to the soldier. All to remind us of the real casualties of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got round to watching Saving Private Ryan in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of D-Day. It's quite an impressive film, sustaining a long running time with few weak moments, and presenting an entirely new level of realism in the depiction of the battles. The violence is quite shocking, and it's not often you can say that given the exceptionally high level to which our depiction of and tolerance of violence has been pushed in recent years.One thing that bothered me though was that the film-makers appeared to be unaware that quite a few non-Americans were involved in the D-Day push too. No disrespect to those brave Americans that gave their lives, but it would have been nice to have the film acknowledge the sacrifice of numerous other countries too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best World War II Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is actually a simple tale told through the mind of the man who was saved...Private Ryan... There's been very little attention focused on the opening and ending sequences, where we see Ryan as an elder, complete with his family. &lt;minor spoilers&gt; We know from the opening that his coming back to Normandy is incredibly significant; it's in his walk and in his eyes... As he kneels down on the battlefield cemetery his mind is far, far away...After the tale is told, the ending is as touching as anything I've ever seen in the movies...We get the feeling his journey (here and in life) is now complete; he's paid homage to those who fought and died for him (and for all of us). Very Simple. You can talk all you want about the historical specifics and/or inaccuracies this film might or might not contain; to me they are irrelevant: The bigger picture is not in dispute - WWII, the war in Europe, the fight against Hitler, the allied invasion of France, and D-Day were all defining moments of the 20th Century that brought out the worst (and best) mankind has ever had to offer. The main body of the film is incredible. Difficult to watch and just as hard to look away from, the opening and ending battlefield sequences set new standards for action-cinematography. To those who have criticized other portions of the film as boring, or over-the-top sentimentality, I think Spielberg's attempts to humanize his main characters are a great success; unlike BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story takes the time to let us get to know each soldier - I WANTED to know who they were and as each &lt;spoiler&gt; begins to get "picked off" as the story evolves, you feel yourself mourning the thousands of soldiers each represents. Tom Hanks is wonderful as the Captain in charge of saving Private Ryan...his performance is understated to perfection. Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are all believable and finely cast in their respective roles...This film takes the time to flush out its characters. In the end, when all decide that saving Private Ryan is the right thing to do and &lt;&lt;spoiler&gt;&gt; most end up paying with their lives, I was struck with what a great sense of appreciation I felt for their accomplishment; with what it meant for Private Ryan, and again, what it meant for all of us. My father died in 1966 as a direct result of an injury he sustained in WWII (B-24 pilot who was shot down in 1943 over Germany, sustained severe head injury, lost 10 of his crew, was held as POW for almost a year before escaping, Silver Star recipient, died of brain hemorrhage 23 years later). I know this film would have made him proud.</fullReview>

The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!10/10!!!Highly Recommend</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening &amp; closing scenes were for me the hardest to sit through as they both convey such a powerful message that really the film is somewhat of an anticlimax. I had only stood overlooking Omaha beach where the opening scene was shot about 9 months before they commenced filming. When one looks over onto Omaha beach itself today there is really nothing to indicate the bloodshed that is so graphically portrayed in the film. It is the most peaceful &amp; surreal place one can imagine &amp; a fit resting place for the rows upon row of pure white headstones that adorn this immaculate cemetery. There are several other cemeteries in the area but this one is something special &amp; the opening scene of the movie captures the solemnity &amp; majesty of this monument perfectly. I just stood there among the graves in awe &amp; admiration of the sacrifice made by these young soldiers who died in a foreign country among the depravity of war to ensure that we could live in relative peace. I can understand why so many veterans could not sit through the opening scene &amp; never saw the movie so overcome were they. They would have had just as hard a job with the final scene had they stayed.I feel the film itself will stand as something of a monument to those who fought against the forces of evil &amp; were prepared to die in the process.The sheer scale &amp; logistics of the movie are mindboggling to say the least. Hanks was his brilliant self although I consider Sizemore nearly stole the show with a supporting performance par excellence. Not exactly Spielbergs masterpiece as I believe we will see more of this type of film from him but it will do for the moment thank you.</fullReview>

I didn't like the man that was carrying the ammo for the battle in the German town. He sat around crying and scared which is understandable for awar because there are no men who will just stand up and shoot a bunch of guys and not be afraid of everything. I know in a war you're scared all the time or most of the time but this character just didn't seem to fit. His comerades were being slaughtered around him and he didn't do anything and that made me hate him. If you want a good story for D-Day, settle for 1962's "The Longest Day."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers ahead...Saving Private Ryan is a movie about World War II. In this it is not original. Hundreds or perhaps thousands of films have been made about this subject. What makes this film stand out besides the magnificent acting of Tom Hanks (possibly his best role, and that's saying a lot) is the film's plot. A dozen men risk their life and put service to their country on hold in order to retreive a single officer. Not one that is crucial to the war effort, indeed, not one that is even in enemy hands. Just one that is the last surviving son of a mother that has lost all her children in the war. The irony and contradictions of a dozen men risking their lives to locate and retreive a single officer is almost paralyzing, and surely secures Speilberg's masterpiece a place, in my opinion, among the finest movies ever made. Everything about this movie is spectacular, from the acting to the effects, to the dramatic qualities. Possibly the finest of all the World War II films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Saving Private Ryan', takes place during WWII, in Europe. At the beginning, an old man (Harrison Young) walks up to a grave, then the movie shifts to the D-day invasion, on June 6, 1944. As men get torn up all around, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) moved his men up the beach. They finally breach it and take the beach after a deadly day. Soon after this bloody battle, Captain Miller (Hanks) receives orders to retrieve Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). They have to find him, because all his other brothers were killed in combat. Thus, the only surviving son rule was in affect. While this is happening, men are questioning why one man is so much more important then them after some of them get torn up. The group of men encounters battles all over the place and search for Ryan (Damon). Finally, they find him and his unit in a city. However, Ryan (Damon) refuses to leave the men in his unit. They end up fighting for control of the city.This movie sparked the more modern war movies, which show more emotion then the average action/war flick. Moreover, it does not show explosion after explosion with no plot to go along with it. The viewer sees the human emotion involved in this movie. Viewers see men crying out for their mothers, and see medics trying in vain to save lives. The viewer does not see the `faceless' people of war movies past, rather the viewer sees people, real people with real emotions throughout the film.The circumstances for these men weren't ideal. When they where at the town they had to set up the best method for attack. They were low on weapons; Miller (Hanks) shows the men how to make `sticky bombs' with their socks. Later Ryan (Damon) shows Miller (Hanks) how to set off mortars by hand. This shows the planning and improvising that is done in war. Most people would think war is just chaos; however, for the most part it is a well thought out process, which includes chaos.</fullReview>

The plot of the movie is perfect. The mission is to save a man. You are able to do so much with this kind of plot. The relationships between the soldiers becomes a key factor in this film. The triumph, the heartbreak, the relationships and the heroism is the glue that keeps the film interesting and moving. This is one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in "Saving Private Ryan," one of the best war films ever made. Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers: Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James, who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once.The opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience. I have seen "Saving Private Ryan" many times and I always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me. It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. He continues to produce box office hits along with Tom Hanks and the legendary director Steven Spielberg. "Saving Private Ryan" is one film to watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a truly amazing opening 30 minutes. We follow Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his men during the d-day landing. A lot of the techniques used during this opening sequence have inspired many other directors since.The only trouble is the movie has a lot to live upto after the opening sequence. We get down to the main story which is Miller's orders to find Private Ryan and return him home to his mother who has lost all his brothers in the war. Whilst the remainder of the movie is ok and Spielberg shows us why he is a great director the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the opening. 8/10. (10/10 for first 30 minutes then 7/10 for the remainder)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I dont think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down the best war movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only the best war movie but probably the most realistic movie where man confronts death. I have seen every movie on the subject of violence, gore, war etc. and though this is not a gore fest just for the sake of showing blood, the blood and gut aspect rates up with any for realism. Such as it is war is bloody and this shows it.Let me make one thing clear. This does not mean the movie isn't top notch every where else. In fact that's the reason the bloody fighting is so real because the acting and directing brings it to life. Spielberg has to be totally commended as I can't think of one director aside of maybe Ron Howard who could have brought the realism to film that this winner does.Tom Hanks is absolutely outstanding. It is in his 3 top best and may be his finest. That's up for others to decide. Never the less he is superb. But he is not the only one. Tom Sizemore who I think never gets enough credit is fantastic as well as is Ed Burns. In fact I have to rate this as the best supporting cast in any movie I have ever seen. They are that good. They just feed off each other and it shows in every scene.Speaking of scenes there are literally dozens of outstanding ones in this but the one that really got me was when Jeremy Davies who plays CPL Upham (He played his character so good I wanted to strangle him for his cowardice) can't muster the courage to go up the stairs and help Adam Goldberg who played Pvt. Mellish (another outstanding acting job) in his fight with the German Soldier. I actually was holding my breath when the German was slowly plunging the knife into Mellish's chest and whispering to him to "shh shh shh" thus killing him.Without doubt a movie for all time. As far as realism and just plain great acting, direction production sets etc, etc, etc, this is as good as any there has ever been made. I rate it 5 out of 5...no make that 6 out of 5. Awesome is the only way I can describe it. I have watched it at least 5 times and never get bored.</fullReview>

The story is also very true and enjoying to watch this film does have a few famous faces such as Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Vin Diesel, Tom Sizemore which all act very well in this intense movie in my opinion this is the Greatest war movie ever made! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan is a cheap play for easy money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I spent three years of my life doing military service during the Vietnam period, I'm not going to excuse myself for criticizing Saving Private Ryan for being cheap mystification in the pursuit of easy money: (1)pulling cash from the pockets of persons from generation of the War nearing the end of their lives in a world they don't identify with very easily and a long way away from their early memories, or (2) doping the younger generations with the illusion that one can passively flip around in time and space, or onto the Normandy beaches, like a minor god by way of images and popcorn for under $10. But, where's the beef, it feels good?: don't read any further if that's what comes to mind.The generations born after 1945 need to start thinking themselves past World War II into the world where they actually live, and stop trying to zap through virtual reality (with $ magic) to a sweet past of handsome heroes who woo virgins at soda-shop counters. The film `The Longest Day' was the war generation imagining what they had lived, for better or for worse, but there was actual experience linked to what was put up in the images. Ironically enough, the screen heroes_ people like Ronald Reagan _ did their war in Hollywood where the only real danger was perhaps falling off a bar stool. The war generation itself however was capable of a more critical look at their own times: for example Norman Mailer's, `The Naked and the Dead', or Joseph Heller's `Catch 22', or Leon Uris's `Battle Cry', or Irwin Shaw's `The Young Lions', to name some of the most widely read (and seen) material. In comparison, `Saving Private Ryan' is a big step backward because it feeds completely upon a too apparent Manichaean conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil for a mostly postwar born audience who's closest contact with the War was in an Army Surplus store, or in family stories, second or third hand. In short, Saving Private Ryan doesn't make the world around us any clearer, it feeds on our worst fears and illusions. It would be helpful to know what experience of war, say during the Vietnam War period, Steven Spielberg depended upon to empathize with a soldier facing actual battle.I admit that, as a soldier, I didn't face real battle myself, but I did go through some very tough military training and I had a near fatal accident working as professional deep-sea diver. Thinking of people I know who did face battle, from my father's generation (including my father) and of people I knew who fought in Vietnam, I think it is only respectful to say that it's simply not possible to imagine your way into what a soldier goes through in battle, as regards the raw fear at the threat to one's survival, or the controlled madness one feels toward an enemy. Most soldiers I know who fought have told me that going into battle they experienced themselves as another personality who listens to nothing else, sees nothing else except what could matter for survival. They were surprised to find such a self inside their own skins.Primitive brain memories we confront when our survival is in question are short lived, happily enough, and well trained soldiers are taught when and when not to allow themselves to slip into this instinctive set of gears which are the ones we normally learn to repress in order to live in society. Some men are haunted for the rest of their lives with horrible dreams or memories they never manage to put behind them. Most war tried soldiers return to civilian life and reintegrate society without apparent difficulties, but what is most striking about such men I find (including my father) is that they usually refuse to talk about themselves in actual battle situations, and I think it's because they have made a deal with themselves, for their own mental health, to keep to themselves experiences that are so subjective and buried in their nerves that they cannot be transmitted in words to anyone who has not experienced a similar `heart of darkness.' Likewise, real soldiers in battle know too that, should they die, it will very probably be alone and hours before anyone even notices, and that there will be no long camera shots zooming in over the violin music to pick up their immortal last gasping words.To Saving Private Ryan viewers who marveled at the Omaha Beach landing scenes at the beginning of the film, they've been robbed if they really think they can get up that sandy ramp in a padded seat in a darkened movie theater. To get some realism into the experience, people would need to stay awake for three or four days in a rolling ship smelling fear and vomit, have their minds wiped clear about how the story ends, experience the awful smell of black powder mixed with perspiration, have no idea where they're really going, or what's awaiting them and, last but not least, experience what hellish noise bombs, and shells and machine guns really make as cold seawater runs into their boots. There are certainly some important films yet to make about World War II for us who were born after, films about a postwar world that's not a pure catastrophe for example, but Saving Private Ryan just isn't one of them. However, Mr. Spielberg may have some very deep personal experience with soldiering we need to hear more about. I'm all ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>saving private propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must be a certain element, a certain unspoken magic when a particular film gets heaped with such a volume of praise and emotion from its teary eyed and awe-struck audiences. Saving private ryan has, over the years, been one of those films. The peculiar thing is that it doesn't deserve much praise or much of an investment of emotion.Yes the famous omaha beach sequence is impressive. Limbs are blown off, and men hold in their innards while crying for their mothers, etc. Guess what kiddies, has war ever suggested to be otherwise? Is this one scene enough to pass off the rest of the 2 and a half hours of the film? The answer is no. Just because one scene is technically brilliant, does not mean that somehow the entire film has justifiably earned the right to be called one of the greatest war films of all time. But again and again, whenever i hear this film being discussed, the only scene that comes up is the first 25 minute invasion sequence.The rest of this film was personally to me, a total wasted opportunity. For one thing, how was it possible for hanks and his 1950's ww2 cliched troupe, to casually stroll through a french field? This early into d-day, the bocage areas around france were still full of threatening german units, long from being reduced. Makes no sense.The biggest failure of this film was, predictably, its childish portrayal of german troops. Again and again, i cringed at how pathetically inept they acted. That last battle scene was something straight out of a sgt. rock comic. Wave after wave of germans just run into fire, not taking defensive positions until about 2/3 of them are lying dead in the normandy sun. Somehow hanks and his buddies always seemingly dance their way out of oncoming bullets. The machine gunner in the tiger was seemingly to high on hashish to fire at the americans. There is also no way in hell a sticky bomb would take the treads off of a tiger. And why the hell did all the german troops have shaved heads??? Not from the photos i've seen.But i did love the moral message of the film, and perhaps this is why the american public who loved this film so willingly gave spielberg their hearts. It doesn't matter that this film consisted of a script so simplistic, that it could have been written by a high school sophomore working on a ww2 final essay. Makes no difference. The message we all wanna hear is, America is good, everyone else is bad. We don't do bad things, noooo sirry. We only get into wars to stop tyranny. Well, there are some of us who would contest that...peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The actual "opening scene" and it's impact on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not really sure why I feel compelled to post my experience when watching this movie but after reading many of the previous comments it is apparent that the impact for me is quite different than most other people.I went to our local theater to see Saving Private Ryan with my teenage son and one of his friends. I was fully prepared for the realistic beach landing sequence that had already gained so much attention prior to the film's release so what happened next is a personal experience I will never forget. The actual "opening scene" is NOT the battle sequence but the images of the elderly Ryan and his family visiting the American cemetery at Normandy, France. In the span of a few seconds, I was transported back in time and place to a raw spring day in 1982 at the beaches of Normandy, France. It was there, with my late Father and Mother, that we walked the same path along the cliffs as shown in the film. My wife and children were with me (as in the film) when my Dad turned and walked out among the sea of crosses and was overcome with emotion (as in the film). The horrors of war were never more apparent to me in a personal way than at that moment.It was as if Spielberg had been there 30 years ago and somehow filmed our family and then edited it onto the beginning of this movie. I was so shaken that I barely remembered the rest of the movie and it was quite a while before I could get up and leave the theater. I am normally not prone to emotional outbursts and was embarrassed that I could not stop crying even as we left the lobby. My reaction scared my son half out of his wits since he had no idea what had hit me so hard (he was only 2 years old in 1982).I have only watch the film once since then and the impact was just as powerful. I have often wondered if anyone else relates to this scene as I do since every other reference to the opening scene is actually the beach landing.For me, the cinematic faults or virtues of this movie are irrelevant in relation to the pain and sacrifice that this war inflicted on the world and I believe there is value in the way this film helps to assure that the pain will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a graphic and intense war movie that portrays some of the realities of war. I'm no WW2 veteran but I do know that this film is probably as close to war as we can really get without actually being there. The movie is very well done and in my opinion, should have won best picture in 1998. I know that some of you may not agree with me on this but for those who are on my side about this all know that this movie should be remembered by everyone that watches it. I highly suggest this movie to everyone who wants to know what it was really like for those men in WW2. In fact, I think that everybody should watch it. Whether they want to or not. It should be mandatory for people to watch this movie at least once in their lives just to remind them that freedom is not for free. I still stick with my opinion on saying that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. Actually you know what, it probably is the greatest movie ever made. No doubt about it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Spielberg is a superb director of actors and action. The opening section of this film left me breathless and disturbed. The scene with the collapsing wall and the German soldiers with the ensuing Mexican stand off is nail biting. Similarly, the final battle sequence is deftly choreographed. Some fine character scenes linger in the mind, as when the soldiers listen to Edith Piaf while waiting for the Germans. However, if this is war as Hell/absurd/confusing it is also war as boys own adventure. Where are the politics? Historical context? Are we really expected to believe that in a huge theatre of war a group of soldiers would be allowed to wander around in search of one man? Compare Ryan to The Thin Red Line. You want to consider what Malick might have to say about war with his use of rich images that linger in the mind long after the end of the film. With Spielberg I was left largely with the memory of the opening and closing scenes.</fullReview>

The film is like a roller coaster of emotion and terror. Filmed up close and with the cast in every sense it was emotionally draining. I have since bought the dvd and seen it many times. I cannot fault it. I have also been to the D-day beaches, read the Ambrose books and visited the grave yards including the one in the film. It is exactly like it.It is hard to say what is my favourite scene but the sniper shooting the german in the church tower is brilliant and perfectly done.I've had enough of war films that show people getting shot and falling gracefully to the ground, in SPR they show it how it is, ugly and very cruel. If you want proof see the news clip of the Yanks executing the young vietnamese boys in the street. SPR brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie is included in the Top 250 and to be quite honest, I just don't understand why. The most realistic warmovie ever made? Perhaps because of the special effects (those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying) but the sole reason why that is like that is just because "Saving private Ryan" is the kind of warmovie they don't make any longer, but believe me, if "The longest day" or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this Spielbergmovie. Surely not a bad movie at all, even worth your time (and even more than that) but Spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known, but then again every war is a tragedy (I see no difference in a soldier dying in France or somewhere in Palestina). Spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once. Good movie, even a bit more than that but just don't overrate it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic view of war yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this film is not 'entertaining' in the way war films like Pearl Harbour tried to be. This film attempts to re-create war as realistically as possible, and, although I've never been in one myself, from what I hear it is the best representation yet. By definition this means you cannot 'enjoy' it like you would most films. The opening scene at the beach during D-day was harrowing rather than enjoyable to watch. You don't find yourself on the edge of your seat as bullets fly, you find yourself cringing and wondering why on Earth people get driven to this. After this scene the film becomes less miserable and slightly more watchable as an entertainment mechanism, but it never loses its realistic touch. Hanks delivers a memorable if not slightly flawed performance, whilst the script is interesting to listen to. In general, this is the first film I have come across that truly played on my emotions and affected me, which is what it's meant to do. It is a fantastic achievement in the sense that it finally begins to show people just how real the horrors of war are. If you're looking for a nice night in with an action film, don't watch this. If you want to see closer to the truth, and appreciate truly great filmwork, watch it.</fullReview>

During the scene on Omaha beach at the beginning, I couldn't believe what I was watching. You are there and you feel as if you're being shot at with all those men. I absolutely love this movie, and while Shakespeare in Love is Oscar material as well, Saving Private Ryan is far superior. I cried like I never have before, during the scene where Wade is killed as they charge up the hill. I don't think any movie has done to me what this one did. This movie shows the viewer the hell that war is and puts the viewer through it as well. The film will definitely be added to the greatest films of all time in the future, and it rightfully deserves to be high on the list. If you have the stomache to handle this movie and are ready before it begins to be put through an emotional rollercoaster, please, please watch this movie.

		<fullReview>For better or worse, Saving Private Ryan has got to be the greatest war movie ever filmed. Far from being some artsy fartsy effort. This film is as hardcore as they come. The 20 minute beach landing scene should show you that this film isn't for the faint hearted. Spielberg has really outdone himself with this movie.The battle scenes are unbelievable. For accuracy, blood, violence and length they are unmatched as far as my experience can say. The beach landing, the assault on the radar site, the heart pounding final battle, all of them are superb portraits of both combat itself and the men involved. All very intense and bloody. If you love movie battles then this is the film you've been waiting for. Some might call this film porn for action junkies but it is more than that. Beautifully shot and orchestrated, Saving Private Ryan is ultimately a tale of the men in combat rather than the combat itself. Unlike a lot of war movies, in Saving Private Ryan you actually care about the characters and don't just look at them as bullet catchers. Bottom Line: This film should be in everyone who calls themselves a movie fan's collection. This movie is not to be missed and should be mandatory viewing in schools.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, between these two scenes, the film is very simple, to say the list and full of hidden propaganda (very logical, since the film was made with the blessings of the American army). I didn't see anything against the war, like I expected, only that in a case of it, we should be doing our duty, even if it is a terrible thing and a lot of us will die a terrible death.

		<shortDescription>Claimed Reality Is Flawed But Film Is Still Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am a thirty year military professional many people have asked my opinion of the film. This is it in a nutshell:The Weapons:The thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticeable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.The Sniper:The sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.The Uniforms:The field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticeably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.The Battle Scenes:Every one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less "gory" than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompson's was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.The Characters:This is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the "war". These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the Green Berets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch "They Were Expendable". To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.The Plot:I could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.What I did like:The cinematography was superb. The sound was great. It was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire I have heard on film to date. Still, this wasn't consistent throughout. The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people. Real war is much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Saving Private Ryan to be an extraordinary movie but only one thing kept it from getting a perfect rating : Where are the minorities in this film? Does Spielberg really think that there were no blacks or latinos in the war? Every soldier is white caucasian. Tom Hanks is good but this is not his best film. Tom Sizemore I feel is the top actor in this movie. He is incredibly intense, almost like he has been involved in a war in his life. The war scenes are the best and most realistic ever created which explains why some veterans have trouble watching the movie. This movie is so close to perfect, only the exclusion of minorities keeps it from this.My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not Steven Spielberg's best film by a long shot (ET or Schindler's List anyone?) but certainly his most graphic, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much summed up by its tagline "The Mission is a Man". The film is simple, almost to the point of frustration and possibly Spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film (war is, um... bad). However what it amounts to is poor storytelling. Coming from Spielberg, a man who prides himself for storytelling, this is a disappointment.Tom Hanks plays the everyman, again, as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country. Matt Damon plays Private Ryan, the young soldier that Hanks and his crew have been sent to find. Beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes, Private Ryan is an uneven work. What people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with, what I guess, brutal violence. Oliver Stone managed this better in Platoon (even the brilliant opening scene in Private Ryan does not compare to the scene in Platoon where the soldiers burn down the Vietnamese village).That said, SVP still features decent performances from Matt Damon and Tom Hanks with excellent support coming from Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from Vin Diesel, in a small role as an Italian-American soldier. The direction is also solid as is the script. However mundanity and Spielberg's safety net, sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the Spielberg cannon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that this film didn't win the 1999 best picture oscar, the film is so brilliantly made that it practically had it in it's grasp. But a word of warning, this is a different sort of Spielberg film. There are no aliens, no sharks and the film is not in black and white, but the film is VERY violent.Ok, i've got that off me, the film is...brilliant. The Film opens at the D-Day Landings, which will be for me the best opening to a film ever. Spielberg re-creates the landings with such preciseness, the way it is edited, the way it is done...it is so brilliant.The rest of the film is a story to save a man behind enemy lines. But really, the real star is the Omaha Beach Scene.This is Spielberg at his best, yet he got screwed like ET! Damn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the most realistic war film ever. Everything about this movie is good,the natural acting, the realistic battles (especially the sound of bullets whistling by), and especially the storyline. Of course there are a few flaws, no movie is perfect, but they're just minor. The story here is really deep and straightfoward, 8 men&gt; were sent to find one private Ryan. On the way they became skeptical and start asking themselves whether that risking their life for one man is the "decent" thing to do. Unlike BLack Hawk Down, also a good war movie, you have a sense of connection with the individuals in the movie, the characters build up pretty well. And sometime you feel for them, you understand their situation, and their state of mind. I really don't understand why many people complain about how Steven Spieldberg didn't show other Ally Forces in the movie. The movie is about 8 American men trying to bring another man home. That's why it's call Saving Private Ryan. This isn't a documentary movie about everything that happen involving every nations during WWII starting from 1939-1945. Otherwise it be called The World At War or something like that. So stop complaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an ex soldier who has been in 'combat' I thought at first that this film was too real at times and I was actually uncomfortable during the beach landing scenes. However, that is my ?psychological' problem and no reflection of the film. It makes me like and appreciate this film even more and I have watched it again and own on tape and DVD.This is without doubt one of the best war films ever produced and it benefits from the polarity of ?war' as the scene and ?humanity' as the theme. A must watch movie if only for entertainment but we all learn something from these types of movies. And as the effects in movies get more and more realistic and perhaps over-realistic then we should force our leaders to watch them. With computer simulation power we might put an end to war? Nice thought but lets not forget that man is a natural born killer.Anyway, I digress. The movie is excellent and should only be watched on big screen with 3D/5.1 surround sound to get the full effect. If we learn something then even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Around, the best possible war film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, According to the rating I've read on this site, No! In my 2 cents though, I would put this film up near the top. As I sit here I can't think of much wrong to write! Steven can REALLY make any kind of plot shine and, in my thoughts, this is his best. At first the Idea of him casting Tom Hanks as the lead in this film didn't thrill me. I'm thinking, this is that guy from "Seattle" who fell in love with Meg Ryan! He just didn't strike me as that much of an action Hero. Well, in this roll, Tom didn't have to be an action kind of person 'cuz this is the one of them few films i've seen that doesn't have violence just for the sake of having it there. This film contained at the time of its release some of the most nasty and realistic battle scenes I've ever experienced! And unlike Black Hawk Down, this film has no work up to the landings on June 6th.Imean you see this person, visiting the cemetary. We're not told his name nor which site he's looking for. What we, the audience realize right away though is that this man was a VETERAN who most likely fought here. In then he stops if front of one grave, and in my opinion, the best scene of the film, french hornsring out a powerful few notes as the camera focuses on the lines and lines of crosses. Then the allied assault starts, with all its fury at Normandy. Well, I can't say any more about that.So leading a crew of 8 men through swarms of German reinforements, Tom Hanks must find a private who has lost all of his brothers. "It doesn't make any sense" is the theme to the whole mission, unlike in other films where the soldiers all never even think about there orders as anything but the most meaningful and heroic things on earth. And of course, why are 8 men being risked for one. The nice thing is that Steven never really answers the question but simply shows the results. I won't spoil the end but I should say this: Don't expect hardly any of the main characters to get out alive!Totally wonderful film. John's score in this film is the best. I love his music. It's always perfect. The sound is very well done. The camera effects are stellar and I'm sounding silly here but I'm having a hard time finding adjectives that describe what a good film this is. If you don't have this film already, what are waiting for. I'm glad there are people out there who actually care to make films that are REALLY based on history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg done it once again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched "Saving Private Ryan" for the second time. I could say the experience that was very impressive in the first time got surprisingly even better. This is a long movie so obviously it takes a huge amount of viewings until it's impossible to find something new in it anymore. Steven Spielberg, one of Hollywood's biggest wizards has directed two kind of motion pictures, ones that are purely entertainment and doesn't even try to be anything else ("Jaws", "Jurassic park") and films with a message ("Schindler's list", "Amistad"). In the end this one has a one simple message: war is insane.Greatest things about "Saving Private Ryan" are first of all the sensational, highly awarded and celebrated camera-work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too. That's what makes the film such a thrilling, vivid and incredible experience. It puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to "out there" and puts him/her go through this hell and every nightmarish detail that's part of it. Other marvelous thing is a good story, little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have. That's what keeps the movie interesting all the way.Fantastic cast needs to be mentioned too. Everybody's brilliant but especially Tom Hanks who's come a long way from the time he played only comedic roles to this one - the darkest and the most horrifying and pressuring movie of his career that could easily be described as ultra-violent. I have much less bad things to say about "Saving Private Ryan". John Williams' score isn't the most memorable one he has wrote but to be perfectly honest, I don't really mind because it isn't important. What really disturbs me is the fact that the whole movie is a one giant flashback.Therefore it creates sugary ending at least I don't care to see after two and a half hors of pain, suffering and blood. Well, it's only expectable from Spielberg. Film would be pretty much perfect without the flashback but I guess I can't have it all my way. For the people who claim this is the best war movie ever made I have to state that I really don't agree. It's one of the best war films, certainly in the top ten but it just isn't the best. But it's a classic already. And it will become even a bigger classic. And it's a one hell-of-a experience everyone who loves a good movie should most definitely see at least...well, twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review has spoilers in it. If you want to avoid them, skip this review. This is one of my favorite (real) war film, along whith the secod-best film of the 90s (#1 of the 90s is THE MATRIX). All the acting is flawless, except for the scene where the general says "We have got to get someone to get that boy the hell out of there." The film begins with the most intense battle sequence I've ever seen in a film at Omaha beach, June 6 1944. During the invasion, a boy is killed who is the brother of Private James Ryan, who also lost two other brothers. Since James is the only one left a squad of eight soldiers is sent deep into enemy territory lead by Capitian John Miller (Tom Hanks). Once they find Ryan, he refuses to leave his squad, which is holding one of only two bridges that brach into Poland. By the end only Ryan, and two of Miller's platoon is left alive. As I said before, all the acting in this film is exelent, but the best preformance is Edward Burns' preformance as Rieband. I won't go into the directing because Spielberg won Best Director at the Oscars, so.  I give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really dont understand what is wrong with some people. They claim to hate this movie only for the reason (in my honest opinion) of trying to be some sort of non-conformer. Like "Im this socially different guy/girl, so Im not gonna like this movie and recommend some other movie that nobodies heard of in order to try and be Mr. Originality. (when in actuality their movie probably sucks)." To these people; PLEASE GROW UP!Anyway, back to the actual movie. This was one of Spielberg's many great movies. This film was an excellent war movie. It served its purpose immensely; to show the viewers the inhumanity and pointlessness of war. Im really disappointed it didnt win best picture and that SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE crap did.Many people watch this movie and say "wow the first 30 minutes showed me what war was really like!" While this was true, these people ignore many of the other small aspects of the film that help to bring out this theme of wars destructiveness and dehumanization.Some of these aspects are; 1.Pvt. Jackson saying a prayer every time he is about to shoot someone...2.Caparzo's letter that has to keep getting rewritten because it kept getting blood on it, first Caparzo's, then Wade's, and then Captain Miller's...3.the squad laughing away as they dig through a mountain of dog tags, not realizing that the dead airborne soldier's buddies are staring them down...4.Capt. Miller's tendency to keep zoning out in the midst of battle. He keeps going deaf for a time and in these scenes he sees all the death going on around him and how pointless it is...5.Capt. Miller's shaking hand, showing how scared he is, and how he wants his gardening gloves in his hand, not a gun...6.Capt. Miller saying how he doesn't give a damn about Ryan and then changing his mind once he actually meets the young man and trades stories with him about home...7.Copl. Upham starts out as a dorky, nerdish kid, strict on the so-called "rules" and then at the end works up his courage and executes Steamboat Willie realizing that this is what war is really like and not relying on an Emerson quote to try and get him through things...There is a lot more examples of this, but I think you can get the message. This movie really shows the viewer about what war is really like and how bad it is. Not just by showing an army storming a beach and getting blown to bits, but also by concentrating on a few individual soldiers and showing how the war is affecting them. It was truly one of the best movies ever made and really accomplished its purpose well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an action movie lover, but typically war movies turn me off. There's just too much awfulness going around -- if stuff is blowing up, I want it to be cartoony so I can enjoy it rather than be traumatized.And, frankly, most of the war movies I've seen have mostly commented on the horror of war. OK, I get it. War is hell, and I'd like to spend my life avoiding hell whenever possible. It's certainly not entertainment."Saving Private Ryan" does have its painfully realistic moments, but there is a message and it is worth hearing. It won't spoil the story for me to write it here. Those who died in war made a sacrifice that obligates us, the survivors and beneficiaries of their sacrifice, to live life to the fullest and make their sacrifice worthy.This and many other themes are handled well in a superbly acted story whose visual effects are used to show the aspects of war rather than immerse us in 3D graphics chaos from which we learn nothing (as in Black Hawk Down).Who should see this film:-- War movie buffs-- Action movie buffs, even if you don't normally go for war films, unless the deep thinking and arty aspects are a turn-off-- Drama / arty types who don't easily get nightmaresI'll give "Saving Private Ryan" an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told it was worth it to see this movie for the opening battle scenes alone, and that turned out to be an accurate statement. In no other war movie is there anything like the realism and aura in picturing soldiers being peppered, and sometimes hit, by machine gun fire. From pillboxes on D-Day, no less, with the tensions of an amphibious landing. The scenes of the wounded throughout this film are also something else, serving as the archetype and forerunner of "Black Hawk Down." Some points in the battle scenes, beginning and later, might be described as real and surreal at the same time, a la Kubrick.The rest of the movie as well lived up to the good things I had heard about it. Tom Hanks does extremely well as Captain Miller, the leader of the pack in saving a private behind enemy lines because all of his brothers, fighting elsewhere in WWII, have been killed. Hanks is very natural and convincing in this role, leadership qualities and personableness, forcefulness and bravery. The human element works, and we are moved during the film's progress and conclusion. See this one.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks, as always, does a fantastic job with his role. His certainly is an Oscar-worthy performance. Great supporting cast includes: Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Paul Giametti and Vin Diesel. While watching this film, you feel the anguish, comradery and despair of the characters. An emotionally charged film that is a true war movie and the battle scenes are incredible. Some scenes are graphic but this is war and you have to be realistic with it all. If you have seen "Black Hawk Down" and "We Were Soldiers" and have not yet seen this, then see it as soon as you can. This film is amazing and will stay with you long after viewing. Haunting and intriguing, "Saving Private Ryan" is a masterpiece that you won't forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has made a hymn. This movie pays hommage to millions of lives lost in all wars, by the eyes of soldiers that could be just any soldier. The synopsis isn't important: James Ryan, the last of four brothers will be bailed out of war so that he can return home before he dies. A division is assigned the mission of finding him and bringing him back. But it won't be that easy. It's just that simple, without spoilers. The real juice in this movie is first of all a masterful depiction of war as it was: a stupid carnage that took thousands of lives. And the opening sequence proves what I'm talking about: those must be the most haunting 30 minutes of 90's cinema. The movie's also a great study of how Man reacts when everything has cessed to make sense around him. This movie is not an easy experience. It's a thrill ride, but I'm not talking popcorn: everyone should see it, for his own sake. This movie opens our eyes. And we'll never look at war the same way again. One of the best movies of the last decade, and one of the biggest errors in the Oscars.</fullReview>

No big deal, no trauma, but I did getemotional memory flashes of the rocket and mortar attacks that Ifrequently experienced when serving on DaNang Air Base between 1969 and1970. We used to feel the mortars coming and going as they were"walked" over the base by the NVA in the hills raising and lowering themortar barrels. In addition to the obvious technical superiority of the film, Ithink "Saving Private Ryan" does capture the essence of guys in a warzone. Most of the film is brutally beautiful. Although I was inVietnam during the war, and although I did come close to being "blownup" over there, I was not a combat soldier but with an air forceintelligence unit that was located just across the dirt road from theU.S. Marines. We had been selected because of our high paper testIQ's and given relatively extensive training at specialty tech schoolsbefore getting to Vietnam. In other words, we were all CorporalUphams. "Saving Private Ryan" causes me a lot of soul searchingbecause I loathe the Corporal Upham character and I know if I hadsomehow been assigned to a U.S. Marine combat squad, I probably wouldhave acted like Upham, the jerk.

Spielberg should hold his hands up and admit how much of this picture he stole from 'A Bridge Too Far', the whole of the final battle is based/stolen from that film.

		<fullReview>If this movie is known for one thing, it's the opening D-Day landing scene. On the small screen, this loses a lot of its power. In the theatre there was no escaping the horrific sounds and images, whereas at home you can turn the sound down and perhaps be thankful the screen doesn't fill your vision. That this opening twenty minutes is the most harrowing and realistic depiction of the D-Day landings yet seen shouldn't be in doubt, although hopefully I'll never be in a position where I can make such a judgement based on personal experience.This film says a lot with comparatively few words. The actions of the men speak for themselves, and its to the credit of the cast ? including Hanks, whose acting ability I'm usually amongst the first to question ? that their honest and understated performances are pretty much perfect.It's said that Spielberg over-relies on playing with the emotions of his audience, but when a movie succeeds in making you feel humble, you know you've been experiencing a master filmmaker at the top of his game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>brutal reality of war to the full, especially the first 20-30 minutes when it shows the landing at omaha beach.I think that British and Canadians should stop complaining about them not being in it, because it is about an American unit and an American landing after all so i wouldnt expect to see any British soldiers in it.One thing that annoyed me though was the little remark that was the British armies only mention, if you dont want to mention us then fine, but why the insult about Monty??? 'That guys overrated' Thanks for that one Speilberg and whoever wrote it. Lets get some things straight shall we, Monty was an exellent general and was respected by German generals.General Rommel himself said that Monty was the best allied general of the war, does this not mean anything to americans??? Who is better equiped to judge Monty, one of the best generals of the war (Rommel) or Speilberg and some american reviewers???? Other than that i thought that this was one of the best WW2 films made in the 90's</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan was enthralling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the finest movies every made. The richly wrought characterizations were very deftly done. These were real men who had genuine fear of being hurt or killed. The acting was flawless on the part of the principals and the many supporting roles as well. A friend of mine saw the film ten times in the theater. I went out to buy the laser disc as soon as it came out. That was when laser disc cost $40 for a new movie. Now one can purchase a DVD movie for about half that price in the discount stores.Saving Private Ryan is THE classic war movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something to be proud of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big, grand, breathtaking WWII drama from director Steven Spielberg. The focus of the story is on U.S. Army officer Hanks and his loyal but reluctant group of Rangers who are ordered to go behind enemy lines, find a soldier whose three older brothers have been tragically killed in battle, and give him a ticket home. The performances of the actors are beyond superb and provide the film's emotional stability as we're drawn into each of their minds as they begin to justifiably question the significance of the task at hand. However, it's the eye-popping realism and overpowering intensity of the battle scenes that really packs a wallop in this one of a kind historical drama. Spielberg has done it yet again in this heartfelt masterpiece. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really is no need to discuss what goes on in this film, since all of the world has seen it 10 times over. Tom Hanks is possibly the greatest actor of my generation, I being 26 when the film was released. Thomas Sizemore is one of my favorite actors, despite always being a supporting actor. No question, that this is the greatest war movie ever created, and it will take something VERY special to steal that crown away. As far as I'm concerned it was the best movie that I've ever seen to date. Obviously I gave it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant war epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years after "Schindler's List", director Steven Spielberg delivered another powerful motion picture drama, "Saving Private Ryan". This movie (set during WWII) tells the story of a group of soldiers (led by Army captain Tom Hanks) who go into France to find a private who's three brothers were killed in action, and send him home. The opening 30 minute D-Day sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed. The story is exceptional, the directing is brilliant, and the acting is excellent. Tom Hanks is terrific as usual, and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes Matt Damon ("Good Will Hunting"), Tom Sizemore ("Black Hawk Down"), Edward Burns ("She's the One"), Vin Diesel ("The Fast and the Furious"), Adam Goldberg ("A Beautiful Mind"), Jeremy Davies ("Twister"), Barry Pepper ("61*"), Giovanni Ribisi ("subUrbia"), and Ryan Hurst ("Remember the Titans"). Some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but they're all good here. Popular TV star Ted Danson (TV's "Cheers" and "Becker") and veteran character actor Dennis Farina ("Midnight Run" and "Get Shorty") even turn up in cameos. "Saving Private Ryan" should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998 because it's a war movie that's harrowing and powerful. It did go on to win 5 Oscars including Spielberg's Best Director win. It's one of the best war movies ever made.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the few people who voted under at least a 6 rating, I believe you don't see the importance of the movie. It was probably the best (or at least most realistic) war movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of war movies. It truly depicts what the average combat soldier went through on an daily basis and what men had to go through to save the country we live in today. I once heard Stephen Ambrose (one of the most well-known and respected historians of the U.S.) say, "Saving Private Ryan was exactly what all the people I've been interviewing about this war told me it was like." Steven Spielberg AND Tom Hanks both received the highest civilian medals possible from the navy for making this film. It inspired me, and if it didn't inspire you, you should watch it again and think about what was did to preserve our beloved United States. And you should realize that this is as close to WW2 that we're going to get. It sets the standards for any war movie to come and probably will as long as we're still making movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>saviors must die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, is set in the second World War. The story begins with the American soldiers storming Omaha beach, and hundreds of casualties result. Within the first half-an-hour, there is much blood shed and violence, in order to capture the authenticity of the actual D-Day invasion. It's obvious Spielberg went to great lengths to capture this accuracy, with a sense of documentary-like filming and incredible special effects. Capt. John Miller (Hanks) leads his men into the horrendous battle of Omaha beach, and loses many of his men. After many advances up the beach, and penetrating the German base, they take their prisoners, and what's left of their patrol, and return to headquarters. This is where Miller receives his orders to retrieve Private Ryan (Matt Damon), dropped somewhere in Normandy, and bring him home to safety. Ryan has been chosen to come home due to his three older brothers all dying in the war. Sparing Ryan's mother of the grief of losing all four of her sons, General Marshall has ordered a mission to save Private Ryan. Miller gathers what's left of his platoon, nine soldiers, and heads out to Normandy to find Ryan. Their trek in search of Ryan is no easy task, to quote Capt. Miller, `It's like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles.' Usually plot driven films evolve around 1 dimensional characters, however these characters are far from that. The characters are deep and emotional, many of them reminiscing of their past home lives, families, and fallen comrades in the war, helping to deepen the plot in return. Many of them insult each other humorously, and help deal with their situation by complaining about it. Once in a while, they reveal their emotions to each other, but mostly bottle it up until they are alone. Their journey is hard and deadly. They first arrive to a decimated French town, and lose Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) who attempts to help a young French girl. The message here is, if you open your heart to someone in war, you will only get hurt. In war, there is only room for killing and death. Further along they come along a German bunker, armed to intercept American patrols. Despite the disagreement of his soldiers, Miller orders an assault, and we lose Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi). With one German Survivor, the men want to execute him, but Miller decides to let him go. To settle his men, Miller reveals his background, that he's an English teacher, and that he doesn't want to kill men he doesn't have to. `Every man I kill, the farther I get from seeing my wife.' Finally, Miller and his men find Private Ryan by accident, they tell him their mission, and despite the grief of his lost brothers, decides to stay with his platoon and continue guarding a bridge. Miller eventually decides to help Ryan's platoon guard the bridge, but afterward he's taking Ryan home. Ryan's entire platoon is killed, and 4 of Miller's men as well. By the end of the battle, Miller is shot. Lying next to a fallen comrade, he pulls Ryan down to him and whispers the most important message of the film: `Earn this.' The end scene is Ryan, older now in present day, visiting the American graves in Normandy. He stands above Miller's grave, with his family, showing him that he's a good man, and that he's tried to earn his gift everyday of his life. The plot contains a melodrama, 8 men searching half a country for 1, plus all the obstacles they must confront, and losing 7 lives in the process. Many of the characters appeal to every emotion possible, sadness, despair, fear, happiness, courage, and grief. There is plenty of extravagant action, and the special effects are outrageous. The moral of the story is that war is hell, it's stupid and violent, and leads only to death. Yet men who are willing to stand by each other, help each other in the face of death, and give it their all will survive and live on. This is one of the greatest films ever made, and even semi-based on a true story, but it was one chaplin who was sent to find the soldier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is particularly depressing that folks can't watch this movie and enjoy its technical achievement without bashing its "Americanism". Give us all a break. The soldiers are very flawed, and the US is shown to make blunder after blunder. The Germans are portrayed as an external menace, but so what? Isn't that what war is about? So one of them is a coward? Big deal. Most of them are shown as very determined soldiers, unlike the Rangers, who are all over the map.As for Americans being proud of helping defeat Nazi Germany: What is wrong with that? By the time the US entered the war, 3/4 of the Western war effort had been shouldered by that country, not to mention the colossal undertaking in the East.As far as serious war movies Americans make of themselves, I can only say that, recently, Americans almost always portray themselves in a negative fashion. The "Hollywood" that folks love to bash is notoriously anti-American (these last 30 years). Don't believe me? Watch Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Born on The Forth of July, Hamburger Hill, The Thin Red Line, etc. If you think there is much flag waving in those films, you're very much mistaken. Some of them were very good, however. It is charming to listen to foreigners equate "Hollywood" with "America".If prejudice against Americans precludes you from enjoying American films, then don't watch them. If you do, however, I suggest you review the movie, not its country of origin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very ordinary melodramatic war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I am one of the few who do not sing praises about this film. I am a great admirer of Steven Spielberg's early works--especially his small, great film "Duel". The later works of Spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences, not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives. It is sad that Terrence Mallick's intelligent film "The Thin Red Line" on the same war lost out to this melodramatic, ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money. A few shots of the old Spielberg did surface briefly when the film captured the first rain drops and the boots of soldiers getting wet.Hollywood has made better war films than this one. The little known "Castle Keep" was one such film. Spielberg knows what appeals to the average American mind and makes movies that will be lapped up without giving the average moviegoer any reason to reflect or think. He has begun to play on emotions and is no longer reaching out to thinking viewers. He is aware that this will not make the box-office jingle. Most people do go to movies to relax, not to be wiser. Mallick, on the other hand, makes movies the way he wants them made forcing his viewers to think. Mallick will slowly be recognized as a master filmmaker in the US by adults as time goes by, while Spielberg will continue to appeal to the juvenile minds of adults, who love action and emote easily. The difference was evident, when the Berlin International Film Festival recognized Mallick's film with top honor and the Academy Awards bestowed its top honors on Spielberg in the same year. Viva la difference!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I haven't seen the Thin Red Line that others rave about. Personally, I thought this was the best war film I've seen, but that's comparing it to mostly old WW2 movies starring John Wayne and the like. I won't go into details of how this is good because so many people say it so much better. The realism of battle, the pain, the desperation of men who know they are dying, the suddenness of death . . .all of that was just fantastic.However, this is not a perfect movie. The characters are undeveloped and two dimensional (Giovanni Ribisi came the closest to giving his character more dimension in his one tiny little moment in a bombed out church), though that didn't bother me. The emphasis was really on the battle scenes. Tom Sizemore, although we know next to nothing about his character, also gave a performance of some depth. Tom Hanks character, who was supposed to be so secretive, was the only one we learn about, and that wasn't that interesting. However, I don't think it was necessary to know the background of each character in this movie.The worst character in the movie is Matt Damon's Private Ryan. He was so blahhhhhh. The worst part of the movie is the beginning and end, which begins with an old Private Ryan having a "flashback" of things he didn't actually witness (how does that happen ?) and ends witha typical Speilberg like speech/lesson. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan", my favorite film, should be remembered for decades to come as one of the greatest war films ever made. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat captured the brutality and realism of war with a certain passion. I still can't believe "Shakespeare In Love" won the Best Picture Oscar over this film. After twenty minutes of the graphic recount of the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, we find out that a Private James Ryan, who is behind enemy lines, has to go home after his three brothers have been killed in combat. Captain John Miller, Tom Hanks, leads a squad of soldiers to find Ryan. With some of the most graphic battle scenes, this is a film that will haunt you. It will make you realize of the horrors the soldiers had to face. Spielberg and "Private Ryan" does World War II like Oliver Stone and"Platoon" did for Vietnam. This is a film not to be missed.</fullReview>

The twitching finger of Jeremy Davies. The incredibly bad soliloquy delivered by Private Ryan(Matt Damon). The stupid decision (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) of Tom Hanks and Co. to let Private Ryan have his way and stay and fight off the Germans in spite of all the crap the team went to in trying to locate him. The German who threatens the life of Hanks and Co. and then when they decide to let him live he comes back to haunt them again. What are the chances of having problems with the same psychotic German twice when there are so many other enemies lurking about? What about the ending of the film which makes no sense?(Think about it-Private Ryan couldn't be remembering everything that happens in the entire film, he wasn't even there during DDay, at least we didn't see him. Spielberg continues his sad slide after "The Lost World" and "Amistad". Hopefully "AI" was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt about it, the landing on Omaha beach is great stylistic filmmaking. Succeeds in conveying the violence and randomness of war. After that 25 minutes, however, the film quickly falls into an episode of "Combat," alas, without Vic Morrow. Tom Hanks' dead serious expressions bring more to the material than is there. Then for the final hunk, as they attempt to hold a bridge, John Williams' score even changes to be vaguely reminiscent of an Indiana Jones action sequence. Sorry to say it, but in my book this isn't close to Spielberg's World War II masterpiece "Schindler's List." It's three films tacked together and then marketed as if it were our solemn duty to the memories of those who served in the Armed Forces to watch it. Well, I've watched it, and feel it does their memories a disservice.There's far superior war films - "Patton," "Battleground," "The Longest Day," "Twelve O'Clock High," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to name a few - to turn to for emotionally gripping accounts.Also, if you get the chance, watch the pilot episode of "Combat." Saunders (Morrow) first survives landing on Omaha Beach then needs to take his squad to secure a bridge and encounters a German Tiger Tank. Don't watch because the TV show is an accurate portrayal of history - it isn't - watch to see the similarities to the action plot points in "Ryan."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest War Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg set out to create a war movie unlike anything ever seen, and he succeeded brilliantly. The visual style puts you right there on Omaha Beach. The handheld cameras take away the clean, rehearsed feel that can hurt movies that need to rely on realism. I could go on all day about the film's first half hour- the D-day invasion... but everything the needs to be said about it has already been said. Suffice to say that it will leave you gasping for air. The story is fairly simple, but it works. Mostly, it exists for the purpose of developing each character further. Each character gets at least one moment to reveal himself, and to say something about the nature of men at war. It can seem a bit preachy at times, but it fits with the pull no punches, unapolagetic nature of the film. The acting is absolutely brilliant. A great ensemble with no weak individual performances (except possibly Edward Burns-playing the same wise-ass city boy he does in every movie). My personal favorite performance is that of Giavonni Ribisi. He brings very convincing honesty to every line he delivers. Anyway, this is one of those movies that everyone needs to see sometime. It sheds new light on one of the most important events in history, while telling a good story at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best damned war movie ever made made...Bar none. As a freelance writer I have had the priviledge to interview veterans from WW 1 &amp; 2, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. My grandfathers were in WW2 as well.My dad was in the 82nd Airborne and he had sergeants that were in the D-Day drop. They have told me how this is the closest thing and best depiction of what it was like. Who am I to argue. They were there. We weren't. They praised the accuracy of the weapons, the characters, their actions and the combat. Plus it was a damn good story. The next most commented on item was how the army after the Sullivans tragedy was damned if it did and damned if it didn't rescue Private Ryan.Like Schindler list, this movie should be shown in high school history classes as part of their lessons on WW2. Veterans told me they would include The Longest Day and Tora, Tora, Tora in that category as well. Too many people knock it because of it's big budget. I don't understand that. The movie works in every way. I first saw SPR up in Alpena, Michigan where it was filled with mostly older WW2 generation people. Some were veterans. They had their wives with them. When we left there wasn't a sound made. Nobody said a word exiting the theatre. SPR touched the crowd that much. I had a Vietnam vet who I work with say that after he saw the movie he was sad/depressed for about three days afterward. he said Platoon didn't even affect him that way. Isn't that the sign of a great movie of this type? One that reaches out and makes you feel things you never felt or experienced before.One that actually moves you very deeply. I witnessed that personally as people left the theatre. I can only hope that Spielberg makes another war movie. Hopefully, maybe one on the Battle of the Bulge.I can hardly wait for Band of Brothers on HBO this fall. This was the greatest war movie ever made. Definitely a must see.As far as the top five war movies go I would rate them this way. 1.) saving Private Ryan 2.) Cross of Iron 3.) The Longest Day 4.) The Thin Red Line 5.)tie: All Quiet On the Western Front and Platoon Honorable mention should go to: The Best Years of Our Lives, Go For Broke, Battleground, Tora Tora Tora, Patton &amp; a Bridge Too Far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being of a generation predating the war, I don't really have an understanding of what these men went through. This movie is the closest I have come to feeling the genuine fear and bravery these men dealt with every day of the war. In my opinion this is more than just a movie (unlike so many other war films). The drama portrayed in Ryan touches me in a way that only being there can surpass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find some of the comments that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is another gung-ho patriotic John Wayne-type propaganda movie just a little bit laughable. This is NOT a John Wayne-type my-country-right-or-wrong tract, and director Steven Spielberg has seen to that. True, Spielberg never fired a shot in anger--but then neither did the Duke!The whole idea is that war is Hell. This is true the moment the characters played by Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and others set foot on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 and encounter massive German resistance in one of the most graphic and violent sequences ever captured on film, one that lasts a good twenty-five minutes. The film then proceeds on as Hanks and his platoon are assigned to find a Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who has lost three brothers in other theaters of World War II, and who is believed to have parachuted down behind enemy lines before the D-Day invasion.What Spielberg has done is very much in the tradition of Oliver Stone's PLATOON and Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, though in an obviously less iconoclastic fashion. He has shown how war can bring out the best and the worst in the men who have to fight it. Granted Spielberg's setting is World War II while Stone's and Kubrick's were Vietnam, but the feeling is the same. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was well-deserving of the Oscars it received, and, like its two Vietnam counterparts, gave me a greater appreciation for what men who must fight these horrible wars, regardless of nationality, go through. 10/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the film is directed by the amazing Steven Spielberg and it stars the just as amazing Tom Hanks, you obviously have a winner on your hands and of course you do. Saving Private Ryan is a truly brilliant film with great performances from everyone including: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi. The film definitely deserved all the Oscars it received. Saving Private Ryan is a must-see and I give it a well deserving 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gory, pseudo patriotic movie is just not that good. Behind the emotionalism is the real danger of blind faith in anything. The acting is not that great(average at best) and the only real exceptional factor of the film is the special effects, which serve only to make it for a more unpleasant experience. For a group of outnumbered green soldiers to take on a tank column without proper weaponery is not only stupid on their part, but very unrealitstic. Anybody would have run. The real attraction for people seems to be the "greatest generation" myth which has popped up recently. This view that the folks living during that time were somehow superior morally or otherwise(remember this is the same generation that tolerated segregation and Japanese internment) gives us a flawed view of history. These people just did the things they did because they had to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersAnyone who has not already seen the film might prefer to watch it before reading this review as, in order to make my point, I must discuss the ending.Although the film contains one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen, the ultimate message and overall impact of the movie were drowned in a sacharine sea of contrived sentimentality and bathos. The one scene that was, of itself, worth the price of admission was the mesmerizing sequence in which one soldier bayonets another in a way that superbly contrasts the intimacy and immediacy of hand to hand combat with the indiscriminate and impersonal butchery of the Normandy landings, portrayed in the opening scenes. I was fascinated, appalled and riveted to the screen. I shall never forget it.Unfortunately, by comparison, the rest of the film was a cop-out. I had recently watched the movie "Saviour" and found it a far more powerful statement about war and its impact on those caught up in it. Spielberg's movie could have been even better. He could have created a film that would haunt audiences for generations. Consider this simple twist -Ryan dies and Captain Miller lives. Now how do we feel about Ryan's decision to remain with his comrades? Was he being noble or foolhardy. What would be the difference? Was the Captain noble to disobey orders, or criminally negligent? If Miller is not conveniently taken care of by Fate, will the army punish him? Will he ultimately believe he did the right thing or will he wrestle forever with guilt? Would it somehow have been worse for Ryan to have escaped unscathed while his mates died? Did Ryan have the right to dictate his own actions? Does any soldier? Should they? Was the army hypocritical to place greater value upon the life of one individual within its ranks? What about parents with only one child to lose? Would their burden somehow be less? To who or to what does a man owe his greatest loyalty? Are there even answers to these questions? Maybe war just is Hell!!!Maybe, but you'd never know it by Spielberg!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's amazing how many people think they are experts on war and movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the plethora of reviews on this movie I'm amazed at how many people think they are experts on war.Let's keep in mind that Mr. Spielberg directed the movie - he didn't write it. He no more claims to be an authority on war than my kids do. He is a magnificent director and he does his job well, which is bringing realism and emotion to the forefront of an otherwise brutal look at war. The people who put the film together are some of the most knowledgeable and experienced veterans and historians in the world today so, let's give them a little credit. For those of you who have never been there; don't comment on credibility or realism unless you've actually seen it or done it and have something to compare it to. Saving Private Ryan is undoubtedly the closest most people will ever come to being in the war, thank god!The story is based on the hypothetical scenario of seven U.S. Army Rangers along with a cowardly army corporal/translator from the 29th infantry division who are given the outrageous task of finding a paratrooper (Pvt. Ryan) who was dropped behind enemy lines in Normandy, France during Operation Overlord in WWII. As the sole surviving son of a midwestern family, the brass decides it would be noble to find him and send him home when they realize that all three of his brothers have been killed in the line of duty within 24 hours of each other and his mother will be receiving all three telegrams at the same time. The real story lies in the frustration of the soldiers themselves at trying to cope with risking their lives foolishly for the life of one man who is just another soldier to them. The orders seem ridiculous to the Rangers, but as Tom Hanks' character (Capt. John Miller) keeps reminding them; they are soldiers and it's their duty to follow orders - Period! It is a good portrayal of a scenario that could've very easily happened during the war. Other things far more ridiculous than that did happen. Trust me.The movie is well done and very entertaining if you don't look to find an action movie underneath the story. It's compelling, moving and the Omaha beach scenes are downright shocking at times. While the movie makes all efforts to be as historically accurate as possible, please remember that this is not a history lesson or a documentary. Tom Hanks plays the part of the "unknown soldier", a captain of the Rangers second battalion who were the first american units on the beach at Omaha. The 2d Rangers were also the unit that, despite insurmountable odds, penetrated the german defenses and secured the beachheads for the rest of the Allied units arriving at Omaha on D-Day. The fact that they played the parts of U.S. Rangers of the second battalion is a true depiction of some of the greatest heroism this country has ever known alone in itself. It IS a movie about war and true heroism and it IS historically accurate.For those of you who think there was too much flag waving and blatant patriotism; what is wrong with that? And those of you who think that the germans were portrayed as being too evil? This movie is about eight soldiers following orders and doing their jobs above and beyond the call of duty. It has NOTHING to do with who was the good guy and who was the bad guy. If you want to see a movie that portrays war from a german soldier's point of view, watch "All quiet on the western front" or, better yet, read the book!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in war movies. It IS very accurate historically right down to unit numbers and troop disposition, as well as the general attitude of the soldiers themselves. At least Mr. Spielberg has the common sense to hire some of the best people qualified to make the storyline authoritative, such as Steven Ambrose. He doesn't take it upon himself to try to re-create history itself. The effects are astounding and the acting is good. If you don't like Tom Hanks being portrayed as a patriotic war hero than you definitely won't like this movie. While he's not John Wayne, Mr. Hanks is definitely America's archetypical hero actor of today. Don't make the mistake of comparing Private Ryan to Vietnam war flicks. It's a totally different genre that has never been captured so intensely on film.Not a good movie for the kiddies to watch. Lots of violence and graphic scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many just don't get it. This is an Anti-War Movie. The plot concerns a group of men sent to do something kind of pointless and futile in one of the most necessary and important wars of the last 2000 years. This plot is based partially on a true story, however, the true story happened during the civil war, not during World War II.For a wide variety of critics of this movie a copy of "T2" and "Matrix" would be all they need to keep them cinematically happy for the rest of their lives. Do not, I repeat DO NOT go to see this movie for some "action-adventure." Go rent "Raiders of the lost ark" or some other worn-out mind-numbing eye-candy movie.This movie is really different. It is arguably that ONLY war movie in HISTORY that is 100% realistic, all the way down to the pacing of the war itself. War consists of periods of ferocious fighting and abject terror book-ending long periods of introspection and fear. The closest thing to this movie is "All Quiet on the Western Front."The musical theme for this movie is also superb - it can be compared to the outstanding theme for "Patton". However, the tone and emphasis of the movie and the music are the polar opposite of that of "Patton". I ended up buying this movie and watching it about 10 times. I like the theme so much that I just put it into the DVD and play the music in an infinite loop on the stereo. This is the first DVD that I've used so much that I lost it, and I'm going to have to buy another copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg has a talent for showing, not telling. He doesn't tell you war is stupid, pointless, and takes young men away from their mothers. He doesn't have to. Mrs. Ryan, seeing the War Dept. car pulling up to her house and knowing that at least one of her sons is dead, unsteadily falls to the ground; a young man crying for his mother as he lays dying; another boy getting his arm blown off, staggers for a minute, then retrieves his arm and scurries off. And this is just the first twenty minutes. These images show you what war is like. It doesn't preach. It just shows the reality and allows the viewer to make his own decision.Some people complained Germans were depicted negatively in this film. What do you expect? American soldiers who've just seen their buddies blown to bits make friends with the enemy? One of the great strengths of this film is that it's viewed through the eyes of these young men. When the nervous little translator laughs and talks with the soldiers' German captive, that actually felt realistic, but not negative. The German was a young man, too, and you almost felt sorry for him when the other soldiers consider shooting him. The film simealtaneously shows both sides and the viewer realizes the truth: when fighting a war, you're killing not just some faceless shadow. You're fighting 17-year olds who have families and blood and dreams. If everyone in the world was forced to watch this movie, we wouldn't be having problems in the middle east or Ireland or anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a strange film this one. I would have to say that the opening sequence is impressive but then the film has something to live up to. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it fails and seems to plod on from scene to scene until the big finale when action takes over again.I admire the fact that it is trying to bring to life an event that so many of us can not imagine. I, for one can not realise what the men who fought for their country (any country) gave and hopefully never will have to, but this film tries to address the issue. Successfully too. That is where the film succeeds.Unfortunately, I don't identify with any of the characters within Tom Hanks' team. To me, it seems they are just a large group thrown together so they all can be killed one by one as a kind of sacrificial lamb. A kind of "oh it's another battle scene, which one shall we kill off this time". In between, the conversations between the characters seems a filler to try and give the individual some personality so you feel for them when (if) they eventually die. For me personally, I was losing interest and was actually wondering which one would be next. An average film overall but does show that not all aspects of war are about glory.A once in a lifetime experience. i.e. I would only recommend you watch it once. Not the type of film to watch again and again.To the people writing about only Americans being shown in the war - An American group of soldiers landing with an American infantry sent on a mission by their leader (an American, obviously) to rescue an American soldier from a place where only Americans are based. It doesn't seem that strange to me. If I was the leader, I know I wouldn't go to a group of British or French soldiers asking the whereabouts of an American soldier, surely you would go where Americans are based.</fullReview>

And since when do you judge a movie in accordance with its special effects? Does that mean Matrix is the best movie ever? (I love the matrix, I am just making a point). In actuality, this movie was VERY boring. Also, the way in which the beach scene was shot was no clever, it was stupid and annoying. If they're going to show the scene, I don't care to be in the shoes of the soldier if I'm not going to be able to see what was going on. If the camera needs to be in 1st person, keep it there. To change around was so unprofessional. That scene was a little entertaining when it wasn't annoying, the gore was cool. But I am a gore enthusiast so it doesn't make sense. The rest of the movie was anti climatic and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie cost millions and millions of dollars, Steven Spielberg went for cheap ideas. Yes, this movie is just a heap of tricks and cliches that can appeal to a great bulk of the population, as it evidently did.Sequences made of shots of guts being spilled, heads blown up intersected with sounds of war and then complete silence can be thought to be a very "artistic" and "intelligent" way to construct a movie, but in this film it certainly is not the case. The film lacks ideological background, it just plays and replays on the already used reused and recycled "horrors of war". Yes we know war is horrible, yes we know war is inhumane. What is Saving Private Ryan portraying that is new? It just plays on emotions that the public readily agrees to have, this movie hardly makes anybody think, its just restating what countless others have already said. The film is not innovative at all, it uses a formula which will guarantee positive public reaction, big bucks, an Academy Award nomination and hopefully an award, as it sadly did.The film on its formal standpoint is just another postclassical Hollywood movie, a lot of people, big names on screen, special effects, nothing out of the ordinary. Do we see innovative or powerful use in its lighting? No. Editing? No. Camera movements? No. They do look spectacular I must agree with that, but nothing else, they have no concept to fall back on.This is just one of the hundreds of movies that play on cliches and don't dare to go beyond, they do not dare think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most realistic war movie? I don´t think so.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This might contain spoilers.)Call me crazy, but as a movie SPR is not more realistic than, say, the ´poetic´ Thin red line. Especially during the final scenes, it has the feeling of an old John Wayne flick, when our brave heros fight against an evil, much superior but dumb enemy, and in the last moment, when everything seems lost, the cavalry arrives and saves the day. And beside that, who destroyed the french village where this final battle takes place? Apparently not the Americans (of course), but when Paris fell after a six week campaign in 1940, the war in France was over and there was no need for the Germans to destroy villages in the far west. In terms of realism, movies like Das Boot or Hope and Glory, and I am sure, many other films, that I have not seen yet, are superior to SPR. You might refer to it as the most realistic depiction of the day on Omaha Beach, that´s all.But the first 20 minutes are truly devastating. Utterly brilliant in its choreography. It is not possible to recreate Omaha Beach on the screen, but Spielberg did his (or anyones) best to give the audience a hindsight, what happened to those brave men in that battle. After this first act, the movie goes pretty straight downhill. I didn´t care for the characters. The members of the SPR-Squad are a bunch of stereotypes, representing the most average and archetypical group of American WWII soldiers you can imagine. I believe, this is done by purpose, and a bad idea, because without interesting characters, a movie cannot be that good. Therefore, it has a story, not character driven plot, that drags unfortunately heavily in the middle hour of the movie. Some are irritated by the patriotism and complaining (Where are the British, the French, the Australians, etc.), but hey, this was made by Americans for Americans about Americans, and that´s o.k. In fact, after this and the Korean war, the US-boys might never have been the entirely good ones again. In summary, without the brillant first battle, SPR would be only a mediocre war flick. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a die-hard Steven Spielberg fan, I find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like Saving Private Ryan anything less than a 10, but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me, mainly because they could have been avoided so easily. For example, whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like Matt Damon (and yes, I realize that he is not a teen himself, but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls) in the role of a private in a World War II film?! Tom Hanks was perfect, but only because he is one of the best actors working right now, and he can do a great job in virtually any role. Furthermore, Ted Danson literally stops the film in its tracks.However, Saving Private Ryan, despite these superficial problems, is a truly timeless film, and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of World War II. Besides being hugely entertaining, a lot can be learned from this film. It is a landmark in filmmaking history and should not be missed.</fullReview>

I have to agree that the movie has one of the best realistic scenes ever, has impressive shots on D-day, but there is no valid argument, no deep thoughts of what every INDIVIDUAL is having (like Thin Red Line, but is unfair and not appropriate to compare both of them), somehow they forget about that everyone is important and not just one special guy, this becomes a selfish way of thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less a Film Than a Flattering, But Pallid Simulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all of Hollywood at his disposal Spielberg has no excuse for his own mediocrity as a film maker. This "simulation" fails for the same reason that it is possible. Viewers leave the theaters believing that they understand war, what it was like to be there, and that they have seen a "realistic" portrait of war. Saving Private Ryan makes war comfortable and knowable even in its supposed gritty action. If anything, Spielberg's method suggests a realistic portrayal of what it was like to fantasize about the war while remaining on the homefront... thus in his footage of the landing scene, Spielberg consciously imitates newsreel footage which was viewed back home rather than as it was seen on the beaches. It is a style of film making which believes that the truth is in the details, but the end result is a lifeless mannequin with no soul or inner truth. Saving Private Ryan is much like the photographic snapshot, which however more "realistic" never conveys the deeper meaning and realism of a painting. Although perhaps a deserving pat on the back for a generation which faced something truly awful, in the end I believe Speilberg has done veterans a disservice by flattering millions into believing they understand what it was like to be there (or how else could so many non-veterans talk of the "realism"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan (Der Soldat James Ryan (German title)) has in my eyes one of the most realistic openings in the history of movies in this genre. It shows that human beings are nothing more than beasts when it comes to war. But the plot of the rest of the film is nothing but absolute nonsense. That's where the "dramatic" part takes in. I simply don't believe that such a story really could have happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that most of the people who didn't like the film are from outside the United States. That's not unusual, I think; the movie would have more of an emotional appeal to Americans. But using a movie to voice your own rather bigoted attitudes toward a country is hardly becoming. World War II was a defining moment for the United States, and a very emotional one as well. Americans can be justifiably proud of what the United States accomplished during the war, just as Russians and Brits can be proud of what sacrifices were made on their behalf. I don't like chest-thumping jingoism any more than anyone else, but I honestly did not see that here. I saw pride, not arrogance. I saw American soldiers act cowardly, and German soldiers show mercy. Mostly I saw how combat has a debilitating effect on human beings, regardless of how "noble" the overall purpose is. World War II began in Europe, it did not begin with or in the United States. Any latent militarism or patriotism caused by the effects of two world wars on American culture ultimately owes its existence to the people responsible for starting those wars in the first place. I don't believe, however, that this movie or Tom Hanks intention in making it was vapid patriotism, anymore than his "From the Earth to the Moon" or Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" were. Some patriotism is legitimate -- dying to end fascism and the Holocaust, in my books, rates as legitimate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is easily the best war movie that has ever been made, and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made, period. It is the only movie I have ever been to that has silenced and stunned a packed theater. I clearly remember that during the first silent moment in the film, after the D-Day invasion scene, that the theater was dead silent. If I hadn't taken a second to look around and seen the people it would have been impossible to tell that every seat in the theater was filled.I currently own the movie on DVD and have enjoyed watching it. It is not the same experience as in the theater, but much better than on VHS. Many people think that the movie was far to graphic; although, it was very graphic, that is the way war is. And since Steven Spielberg wanted a realistic movie, that is what he had to do. The story line of saving one man among the slaughter of the invasion of France was an interesting choice for a plot, but very effective. It shows that compassion can still prevail, even in the worst of circumstances.Due to the graphic nature of the movie, people with weak stomachs may want to avoid it (or have someone cover your eyes). To everyone else, watch it. You will be hard pressed to find a better movie.Jammrock</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those people who feel "Saving Private Ryan" was nothing but an excuse to put some gratuitous violence on screen, or feel that the violence was "over the top," I have just three words for you--Read Your History. Read Stephen Ambrose's book on D-Day (Ambrose just happened to be the historical consultant for the film), and you will learn exactly what bullets, mortars, grenades, etc. actually do to a human being. You'll discover that the violence that television and other movies have fed us for the last 20-30 years is a bunch of c**p.And for those people who have been involved in war, then watch this film and claim that the violence is excessive and false, then obviously, your experiences in wartime didn't mirror those men who's accounts were used in the book mentioned above and in "Ryan." And they don't mirror those memories of countless men who saw this film and left the theater visibly shaken, because their story was finally told the way it should be.Steven Spielberg was not trying to "Out-Gross" "Braveheart." He was attempting to open our eyes. And if he was successful, then maybe those truly gut-wrenching scenes would serve a noble purpose--if not "An end to war," then at least an end to the Romanticism of War. Which is, at least, a step in the right direction.So "Shakespeare In Love" received the Oscar. Is it ever going to be referred to as " A National Monument?" I doubt it. "Saving Private Ryan" is still getting coverage that refers to it in those terms.So, to sum up, before criticizing this movie based on its level of violence, try accumulating a little background before making such accusations.</fullReview>

However very detailed and real life war description did not give me a hollow and depressing feeling given by other war movies - most Vietnam War movies.Through the movie I was asking, "why War"? This movie gave me a feeling that I am not an observer but a participant. I give standing ovation to the whole crew as well as actors and the director. This is one big, well orchestrated teamwork.This movie deserved Academy Award and Tom Hanks should be given Best Actor award as well.The movie has given me a chance to think about the human behaviors and extend to which our emotions and humanity could be stretched. I would never endorse any war-ideologically or otherwise. I am very grateful for Mr. Spielberg for making this movie. Men can create war and some same men can create art.</fullReview>

The same europeans who now complain and criticize about the "patriotism" of SPR.

		<shortDescription>A Composite of Other War Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me if I am only restating what many others have already pointed out. I simply don't have time to review all of the previous posts on this movie.I personally was somewhat disappointed with SPR. I would agree with others that the initial 25 minutes, sans the cheesy opening with old man Ryan, was one of the more vivid battle scenes I have seen depicted on film. The invasion sequence definitely gave me a feel for what my grandfather (the son of German immigrants to the US) went through on 6/6/44. From there the movie goes downhill, IMHO.It seems to me that Speilberg set out to incorporate segments of other well known war movies into this one. Scenes in SPR are reminiscent of:Forest Gump:Carpazzo tells the translator not to salute the captain (Hanks) because that only makes him a target for enemy snipers. ( "Major Dan" admonishes Gump not to salute him as enemy soldiers may be standing by to "grease an officer".All Quiet on the Western Front:The night time shelling scenes as the soldiers are making their way over the battlefield at night are similar to what is portrayed in the 1929 classic.The soldier that picks up his dismembered arm is similar to a scene in a great Japanese film.The Edith Piaff record that the Translator analyzes is the same record that is discussed in "the Dirty Dozen".Patton:The discourse between Ted Danson &amp; Hanks (Who else thought that Sam Malone was out of place?) was right out ot George C. Scott's masterpiece. (i.e. "Monte" taking too long to take Caen".Full Metal Jacket:The translator sports a yin-yang symbol on his helmet, similar to private Joker's peace symbol. I don't believe that yin yang became en vogue in the US until well after WWII.The metallic "tank" sounds as the panzers are approaching in the final batle scene are similar to the sound effects in Full Metal Jacket.While flying in the helicopter, Joker remarks in FMJ: "Do you ever kill any women &amp; children?"A: "Especially women &amp; children"Joker: "How can you justify killing women &amp; children?"Later, at the end of the movie, Joker finds himself face to face with a young girl that was shooting at his company: the sniper. In the end, he kills her, but it is no victory for him, only the end of whatever innocence he has left.The translator protests that the company should let the "Steamboat Willie" guy go. (No explanation is provided as to why he stayed around to be captured while the American soldiers were ministering to the fatally wounded Wade). Later, "Steamboat Willie" walks down the stairs past the translator after killing Mellish. He forgoes a perfect opportunity to kill the cowardly translator, sparing him, ala Androcles and the Lion. In the end, the translator musters up the courage to confornt several German soldiers, Steamboat Willie among them. He shoots Steamboat Willie and orders the others the leave. This sequence leading to "innocence lost" simply is unrealistic and does not do justice to circumstance. In addition, while Steamboat Willie's initial portrayal of a soldier in ememy hands is initially realistic, he soon becomes a comic book character with his Star Spangled Banner/"F**k Hitler" routine.The final battle scene disqualified this movie from any semblance of greatness. Great war movies convey the total fultility of war. This film did not end on the empty note that Full Metal Jacket did, but rather the dive bombers showed up just in time and all was well. Where was Sylvester Stallone? The Sticky Bombs would have fit right in with any Rambo movie.I agree with others that the opening and closing sequences were annoyingly sappy, what with the flag and all. However I would note one thing: I don't think that this movie constitutes "propaganda:" as some put it. I call it commercialism. IMHO, this is a movie made by an American director for an American audience. I feel that this movie does not set out to persuade anyone to view the war from the American perspective as much as it is meant to sell the movie to what an American audience wants to see. SPR follows the same formula as counltess other movies before it. Look at the predictable scene where Hanks runs across the wrong Private Ryan. This is about as consistent with a typical American script as a movie can get. As long as this sappy humor sells, it will be a staple of the American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but by no means the greatest war movie ever (or even of the decade, or the year, for that matter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps having viewed this film at the cinema a couple of weeks after its debut tainted my expectations about 'Saving Private Ryan'. Perhaps the immense amount of hype precluding and following its release built the movie up just a little too much. Whatever the reason, I must admit that I found 'Saving Private Ryan' just a little tedious and pretentious. Don't get me wrong here, there's no genre of movie that I enjoy more than the good old [anti]war. 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'All Quiet on the Western Front', '1918: Westfront', 'Stalingrad' and 'Das Boot' (all German productions) are among my all time favorite movies. I like a good, harsh, realistic war movie. And being a product of the electronic generation I can even sit through 'A Clockwork Orange' without even flinching, so the 'realistic' first 25 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' was just like water off a ducks back, to use the cliche.What really got to me about this movie was the element of compromise that marred 'Saving Private Ryan'. The introductory shot displaying that oh so wonderful 'stars and stripes' waving in the breeze. Perhaps it was national pride that caused the Second World War? Unforgivable. The return of this shot at the as yet far away conclusion of the film did little to appease my growing sense of ridicule at the film.However, on a positive note that famous first 25 minutes was a fairly fine piece of cinema. Fast, well coordinated, well coloured (not that I really know what I'm talking about here). But after such a fine beginning Speilburg simply cannot stop the movie slipping downhill from here. I got the impression that 'Saving Private Ryan' was two hours of relative nothing buffered by 20 minutes of pro-Yankee violence at each end. And, I'm sad to say, that is how the war came across. The Germans were still faceless, nameless enemies. Nazi's. The German film 'Stalingrad' (which I believe does the whole war thing far better than this effort) gives an excellent insight into the German side of things.So, in brief:* Far too patriotic for a modern day war film* Emptiness in between introduction and conclusion (totaling 2 hours)Still was above average though. But 'Saving Private Ryan' is by no means the greatest war film ever. There are many films which do the whole war thing much more sensitively, poetically, chaotically, brutally, realistically, bluntly, subtly. The greatest criticism I have for 'Saving Private Ryan' is that I didn't leave the cinema hating humanity for what it put all those involved in the war through, and showing what humanity was capable of. Which other movies do. It would appear that Spielberg decided against this perhaps for fear of diminishing his American audience, who might not have flocked to his movie in mainstream numbers if it were to put forward any message that suggested that ALL involved in wars are victims, not just the Americans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film with a plausible plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is certainly one of the most, if not the most, emotionally shocking films I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). The film successfully recreates a very dark moment in recent history. Spielberg uses the intense opening scenes to promote a calculated audience reaction. He wants to give us, as soon as the film starts, a prolonged taste of what it was like for a soldier, perhaps fresh from cosy US civilisation, to step off a landing craft into the hell and chaos that was Omaha beach. Spielberg achieves this with a cinematographical style drawn from contemporary documentary footage. But for me it were the sound effects that added the final horrific realism to that scene and indeed the whole of the film. The sound of bullets striking metal, water, flesh without the accompanying crack from the far away gun is particularly memorable. (Now I come to think of it a similar effect was used in John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13).The most powerful scene for me, one that gave me a few sleepless nights, was the hand to hand fighting that took place upstairs in the bombed-out house. The wrestling of the two opponents all the while the other wounded soldier is writhing around in the background, the would-be rescuer paralysed by fear, the short, final pleading of the loser is an absolute masterpiece of film making.There is a lot of comment to the effect that the plot for the army to jeopardise a squad of men to retrieve an ordinary soldier is implausible. Yes I imagine that it would have been highly unusual but the action was to have a significant propaganda effect back home. I am sure that many bizarre and costly actions have taken place this century in the pursuit of propaganda. The mood of the domestic population is often crucial to the outcome of a foreign war. Look how it affected US operations in Vietnam. And you only have to read about what massive and risky operations are mounted to retrieve a single, downed US pilot in former Yugoslavia recently to be able to imagine that the SPR plot is not totally implausible.For all the movie's real power there are, in my view, some faults to the film, curious queries that occurred to me whilst watching that have also been picked up by others. The final scene in the present day war cemetery I found to be misjudged. Supposedly to bring the film full circle, to tie in with the very first scene, I found it to be out of step with the previous two-and-a-half hours. Also, I found Matt Damon to be miscast ? for me he looks too 90's. Ryan should have been played by an actor far less well known. I suppose that in the first few days after D-Day, as the Americans spearheaded inland from one of their designated Normandy landing sites, the only other people the Americans came across were soldiers of the German army. The French population having mostly fled beforehand or in hiding and the other Allied troops still pushing ahead from their own landing zones. Having said that, as a Brit., it did feel to me as if the film portrayed the Yanks single-handedly liberating France. There aren't many opportunities for the director to incorporate other Allied nationalities into this scenario. Spielberg might have chosen RAF tank-busters but perhaps if he had he might have felt he was making a point about the Limeys showing up late and saving the day after all the hard work had been done.Overall it is an excellent movie and gets a 10 rating from me. It is not perfect in every way but it is a film that every state-registered voter should see. It is a glorious tribute to all the men and women who served and fought to preserve the freedom and democracy we know (and take so much for granted) today.Lastly, I do find it galling in the extreme that, amongst others, 16 year-olds from Illinois have the arrogance to moan, whinge and complain about this fine film. As the movie is R rated you presumably saw it with your Mom or Dad. I would far rather hear their comments than yours. Keep your comments to Babe 2: Pig in the City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but NOT spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well-made film. Certainly worth seeing more than once. The combat scenes at the beginning and at the end were eye-opening. I knew what this movie was going to be about before seeing it, and I knew what to expect, yet the battle scenes were still shocking to see. However, "Saving Private Ryan" was in no way the best movie of 1998--"Life Is Beautiful" was a superior film, in many ways. "Saving Private Ryan" excelled all other 1998 films on a TECHNICAL level. If you were to remove the graphic aspect of its battle scenes, "Saving Private Ryan" would be just another war movie. Some people consider this the greatest war movie ever made. This movie may have the most realistic battle scenes ever shown, but it's not a spectacular movie. In fact, its plot is rather lame. "Saving Private Ryan" is tied with "Shakespeare in Love" for being the most overrated movie of 1998. "Life Is Beautiful" clearly told a story about love and triumph without the use of theatrics or of famous actors/actresses. I can't see why Tom Hanks was praised so highly for his performance in this film; the supporting cast outshone him. Also, the most hideous thing that was done in "Saving Private Ryan" was to use the United States flag at the beginning and at the end of the movie. That's something that would only be done by someone trying to win an Oscar. I do commend Spielberg for his direction--overall, he did a really good job in demonstrating that war is hell.</fullReview>

I fully understand that war is hell, but I thought it was very unlikely that the German would have gone up the stairs in that way, and end up killing by a knife. I feel the scene was included (awkwardly) for only the shock value. Because of this I lost respect for the movie. The storyline was good and the re-creation of the war was also very good, but because of the above reasons I wouldn't consider it a great movie.</fullReview>

I'm being flippant; let me qualify my statements. I do not doubt or belittle the fact that SPR was of great emotional worth and moral value to many people, some of whom are far more qualified than I to judge... ... but hell, that little demon inside just wants to be heard. And it says some nasty things. I came into this film wanting to _see_ a film - as opposed to three hours of histrionics and melodrama, dressed up as a serious and worthy discussion of war. Worthy - that's the word. Mr Spielberg wants to be _worthy_. He wants to teach us all about patriotism and freedom and evil and good and The American Way. Frankly it was rather offensive. Not his general intent (which was indeed worthy), but rather the manner in which he set about it (which was not worthy). Emotive scenes of slaughter, stereotyping of good and evil characters, simple resolutions, a gimmick in the form of "stickybombs" - all rather fairyfloss, fairytale elements in a supposedly hardcore, realistic film. From a historian's point of view, it spoke loudly of propaganda.A review of '90s films would be incomplete without Saving Private Ryan, and no doubt it will continue to be hailed as "the greatest war film of all time". For those reasons alone, see Saving Private Ryan. But please don't believe the hype.</fullReview>

I'm sure if you looked hard enough though, you can find something wrong with just about anything.I believe it's good to hear all perspectives, positivie and negative. Whatever your position is, there are some undeniable facts; (1) America was the biggest difference in WW2, (2) America is the only true super-power left, (3) Hollywood is in CA, which is a state in the U.S.A. I only bring this up because I think it is the underlying source of a lot of resentment people feel about the display of American patriotism in the film.Whatever your feelings are about the movie, you know that most of Europe would be a part of Germany by now, if it weren't for so many U.S. soldiers fighting and dying for your freedom.Respect the fact that this was a brilliant story told of the horrors of a war and the ultimate sacrifices ordinary people had to make, many of them Americans, in a land from home.Sure there were some gratuitous patriotic moments, nit-pick at them if you must. But don't you think the young American soldiers, some of them literly still kids, dying in defense of your freedom, paid for it?PS - I believe the U.S provided billions of dollars in aid for post-war economic and social reconstruction, to the countries that needed it.

		<shortDescription>If you ain't American....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of the "quality" of the movie a few points about some comments made by previous reviewers:1. I don't know why you consider this a "typical" american movie. Gee, could it be because it was only about Americans??? That was the point...it wasn't supposed to satisfy people from Holland or England or anywhere else...it was meant to show what AMERICANS went through on D-DAY (were there any other countries at Omaha beach..no) and if you ask any American vet who was there, he will say the only thing that was missing for them when they saw it was the real bullets. By the way, my grandfather was there. So to this extent and for these reasons, yeh it was very "nationalistic", as well it should have been.2. How could the americans beat the germans in the last battle...well, first of all, they didn't...only the mustangs saved them (and D-Day to the end of the war in general) Secondly, it is possible that it COULD happen with well placed positions and a plan if you know military tactics and anyway...ITS JUST A MOVIE!!!3. Thirdly, they weren't Marines portrayed...they were army rangers...learn your history...the marines were in the south pacific.All in all, this was a brilliant movie...I suppose you have to be American to "get it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again the egotistic stupidity of my fellow man has not failed to amaze me. I contiuously read in these comments about how people from other countries are offended by the Stars and Stripes flying in the "bookends" of SPR, or how "Pro-American" the movies is.TOO BAD!We Americans have every right to feel proud. The AMERICAN army took Omaha Beach; not the British, not the Canadians, and not the French. Yes, every nation I just mentioned sacrificed its young men in the fight against Nazi Germany; they all had casualties on D-Day, we all know that. But wake up people, get a clue. THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT AMERICAN SOLDIERS. It is not about D-Day, (see the Longest Day for that) it is not about saving the world, or answering the meaning of life. What it is is a FICTIONAL story about a small AMERICAN group of soldiers fighting to survive.When I watch Das Boot, I don't sit and whine about the fact that I don't see any Americans, or there are only British warships shown. I take it for what it is supposed to be, a story about men under extreme circumstances trying to serve their country, do their job, and stay alive. I suggest you all (you know who you are) grow up a little, come back down to earth, and look at SPR for what is supposed to be: ENTERTAINMENT! Very simply, IT is a movie, a tribute from Mr. Spielberg to his father who was a WWII vet. Nothing more.If you still don't get "IT", if you're still offended, if you're still whining because American soldiers stood tall on a tough day 50 years ago, TOUGH! KISS MY RED WHITE AND BLUE A**!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1) Many of these user reviews criticize Spielberg's patriotism. What is wrong with patriotism? Is it necessary for global inclusion in what is an American story of an American soldier being rescued? Of course Canadians and other soldiers were at Omaha beach. I don't think we need a roll call in the movie to show that this was a World War.2) I was profoundly moved/disturbed by the first battle scene. Maybe I'm parsing words, but I don't understand people who call the scene 'great' - as if it was created for entertainment value.I too was silent as I left the theater. Spielberg had told his story and there was nothing I could add. This movie, like Shindler's List, was not about entertainment. It was a historic viewpoint of the horrors of war. (Unlike the Thin Red Line - where I got to see doves released into a slow-motion field of waving tall grass - yech!)By the way, who cares about Oscars? I thought this movie was important - no matter how many or few plastic statues are on Spielberg's mantle. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too much American patriotism? With all due respect, too bad! It's an American film, and I see no reason to be apologetic about pride in one's country. The fact is that the United States was the primary reason why everyone in Europe isn't speaking German and saluting a flag with a swastika on it. As much as that might tick you off, it's the truth. Sure the characters could've been Canadian or British, but again, it's an American film.Too boring after the initial war scene? Uh, can you say story and character development? This was not necessarily meant to be an action drama, so if that's what you were looking for, then I can see how you'd be a bit disappointed. However, each "boring" scene DID have a purpose. The deaths of Wade and Caparzo were important to the underlying "needs of the many, outweight the needs of the few" theme. Otherwise, the end point would have less impact. I can see how one might feel it seemed slow after the Omaha beach scene, but it's up to the viewer to switch gears at that point and get down to the business of watching a story unfold. If you want more explosions and blood, watch Platoon or Full Metal Jacket or Hamburger Hill.Best movie ever? Pretty close to it, IMO. I think Spielberg could've spent a little time adding a human face to the German army (as Malick did for the Japanese in Thin Red Line) rather than treating them all like monsters. But after seeing Schindlers List, I understand his reluctance to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... I saw this movie when it first came out. I really didn't know what to expect, but I must say that I was impressed. I have never seen camera direction quite like that. Everything about this movie was very well done.I have spoken with a lot of vets and historians who said that was a pretty close to how things were on the front. The only thing was that there was smoke on the beach which they couldn't put in the movie because we need to see what's going on.I'm a pretty young guy (young enough to be drafted), and that movie allowed me to know that I never have to go to combat. Steven did a great job of almost putting me in the war.The sound is absolutely amazing! I felt myself wanting to duck as the bullets whizzed by my head.I must confess that the fist time I saw SPR I was so caught up in the violence and intensity of the film the plot was somewhat muddled. I was compelled to go back and watch it again though. The second time around, it made a lot more sense and as a result, became a better movie to me. It is now one of my top 5 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg tries to make up for weak characterization and plot by use of extremely graphic imagery. Why should I care about Ryan, I know nothing about him, except for the part of all his brothers being dead. Should I care about him just because he decided to stay with his platoon rather than return home? Please give me something. And Hanks, he´s had better parts and his performance is way overrated. I like him as much as anyone, but even his performance in BIG is better. In summary SPR is a movie that looks great, sounds great, but lacks a solid plot and character development (very much like the over-hyped Titanic).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Devastating film. The landing on Omaha Beach was as realistic as it gets. The sound and the camera angles were superb. Scenes like the inflated dead animals provided a view of war previously unexplored. However, I don´t know how realistic was the freedom given to the German soldier who comes back to haunt the squad and slowly kills Mellish with the knife. That scene was shocking, considering that the other American soldier was slowly drowning in his own blood next to them two, involved in the loudest silence I´ve ever experienced.Despite a weak plot, I think SPR is an excellent movie, a solid work, and a horrible reminder of the cruelty of war, for those out there who love to WEAR military outfits as a fashion statement and would probably quit three minutes into the battle.For those who mentioned too much Americanism in the film, sorry. That´s life. As far as I know, this part of the war was an ALL AMERICAN effort, and there´s nothing wrong in saluting once again the flag and the spirit of those who died protecting the freedom Americans enjoy and of which I personally benefited while I lived in the USA. It seems some folks take freedom for granted. I wish you had lived here in Nicaragua during the 80´s. You would understand that spirit much better. If you haven´t experienced lack of freedom -and I´m truly happy for you- try to refrain from making that type of judgement.All and all, SPR is one the best attempts ever made to portray the horrors of war as sincerely as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why this film is powerful and important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful and important film, first, because it is about salvation or redemption in this world, rather than in heaven. On the physical level private Ryan gets saved and Captain Miller's squad gets wiped out. On the figurative level Captain Miller's squad, and everyone in it, is redeemed--saved. Saved, because, in spite of the obstacles--including the squad's own internal dissension--it accomplishes its mission. But saved most importantly because it has identified a mission that was worth sacrificing for. At first the squad does not accept the mission as worthwhile. It comes as a result of a military command from "top brass" in distant Washington, D.C.; they don't know Private Ryan, and besides, they have mothers too. Gradually, and mostly because of the quiet insistence of Captain Miller, they come to accept the mission as their own personal redemption. They are not going to do it because Washington ordered it. They are going to do it because it is meaningful in their own lives--it is their ticket home; they, along with Ryan, will have earned the right to go home; they will have done their duty. This personal sense of mission is what the squad finds worthwhile sacrificing for. It is what keeps the squad together. It is why they accomplish the mission. And--for the world is pitiless--it is why all but two die for the mission.This sense of personal redemption, of having a personal goal or mission in life worth sacrificing for, is the most American theme in the movie. It is probably why most Americans respond instinctively to the movie.But Saving Private Ryan is also about art. It defines art and embodies its definition. Specifically, the movie defines art as meaningful communication. Meaningful communication is communication that is meaningful to both sender and receiver, and that occurs in an effective medium. Within the film's story, the most meaningful communications are the soldiers' letters home. They are literally from the heart, as they are stained with the soldiers' blood. Examples of miscommunication or bad communication abound in the movie: foreign languages, yelling at a deaf soldier, telling the wrong private Ryan that his brothers are dead, not telling a glider pilot that his glider has been armored and is therefore heavier than usual, letters from a national government telling mothers that their sons are dead, even the order coming from Washington. Meaningful communication can be noisy, but it can also be silent: the silent cemetery, the unfurled flag, Captain Miller's silences. Captain Miller is the film's expert communicator--he teaches English composition in civilian life, a pointed fact in the movie. To the spectator outside the film, the most meaningful communication is the believability of the fact of war--its din, gore, horror. And, more than anything else, the fact of the sacrifices that soldiers made in that war. Which brings me to the third and final point. This movie is powerful and important because it portrays the utter desolation of war. No other movie has affected me the way three scenes in this movie did: Caparzo's lifeblood streaming out and away from him in the pouring rain; Wade, a medic, begging for more morphine; and Mellish in a life-and-death struggle with a German soldier while an airborne ranger, shot in the throat, is in his own death throes. Nothing is worse than being a combat soldier. No one else faces hopelessness and despair like this.A word to the non-American viewers of this film, some of whom appear to resent its Americanness. Americans are entitled to portray American experience in their films (and other arts). Ibsen wrote plays about Norwegian experience, Patrick White wrote about Australia. That is not to be resented, that is to be respected. Viewpoints differ. What else is new?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NICE MOVIE. GREAT WAR SCENES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 'nice movie'. But there's something that makes this movie a 'nice movie', instead of a 'bad' movie: the war scenes. The first 30 minutes of the movie might be the best 30 minutes of the year, and one of the best 30 minutes of the film history. It's incredible. Those images are an inspiration for moviemakers, those minutes are a filmmaking lesson. Those bloody, disgusting, violent scenes make everybody get shoked. I mean, you're in the World War II. You feel you're there, It's an incredible masterpiece... But that's it. It's over. One of the greatest films ever stops just there, thirty minutes after the film starts. The rest of the movie does not 'fit' with those 30 minutes. Or I'm afraid that I should say those 30 minutes are the ones that don't fit the movie. It's like as if Spielberg had made that scene just for saying "hey, see how violent and disgusting I can be?. The rest of the movie might be made for the people who were born in USA. And since I was born in Uruguay, I didn't like it at all. Because the Americans are always the 'good guys', the only ones who have feelings. Why didn't Steven Spielberg take a look at the Germans? Weren't they afraid too? And what about the last shot of the movie, that American flag?. Hey, I like American people, I really do, but this movie just make them say "Hey, I'm proud to be an American. My country is the best country of the world." That might be true, but there's something called modesty...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Saving Private Ryan 4 times. The first time, on opening day, I entered the darkened theatre with about 12 other people, most of them my dad's age-W.W.II vets. I went in with no preconceived notions, I read no advance reviews. I began to cry a couple minutes into it, beginning with that sweeping view of the cemetary, all those row upon row of white crosses. I was completely blown away by the battle scenes that followed; the praying, terrified boys in the boats, the machine-gun slaughter and the sound of those gunshots, the blood washing up on shore. My hands had gouges in the palms where my fingernails dug in. I left the theatre that day completely drained, useless. I went back a few days later so I might view the movie with a little more detachment and pick up some finer details. While the opening scenes were still jarring, I was a bit more composed to appreciate the other fine qualities and moments in this film. The characters-perfect in their lightly sketched state, especially the characters of Jackson the sniper and Wade the medic. The camera work-astonishing, especially in the battle sequences. The memorable little speeches- Wade in the church, talking about his mom. The pilot of the downed plane reliving the crash. Reiben pensively discussing his customers breast size. The death scenes-Wade getting killed and the desperate attempt of his companions to save him. Tom Hanks losing it after that point, his hold on sanity slipping. Mellish stabbed thru the heart, begging for mercy. Months later these things are all very distinct in my mind as is the eerie, screeching whine of that tank lumbering into the rubble-strewn town at the beginning of the final battle. While this was not a perfect film, it came close. I embrace the reaction of four different film audiences as my own. Never in my life have I been to a movie, once, twice or even four times and had entire audiences go deadly silent. In SPR no-one moved, no-one spoke, a great many boys, girls, men and women wept. After the movie ended, people stayed in their seats, stunned. I have never felt such a universal bonding of emotion that I did during that film. And that is why Saving Private Ryan is so special. In this hopeless age, where life is so cheap and the world has become cynical and hardened to death and disaster, it is a relief to know we can still react to atrocities, such as Spielberg showed in this film, like human beings.Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiddles in a war movie are just not appropriate....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Spielberg manages to show the cruelty of war, this film in my opinion is nevertheless dangerous, as it in a subtle way promotes war rather than despising it. Spielberg wants us to make believe that under certain conditions war is a necessity and legitimate way of solving conflicts. In my point of view this is at least debatable. I don't like this movie, although it is very well done from a technical point of view. I don't like because it tries to make war presentable again rather than trying to show how to avoid it. Sorry, but this time I cannot agree to the underlying message of this movie, regardless how masterly skilled this message has been transformed into pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in response to Tim's complaint about only seeing Americans and Germans depicted in SPR.The whole premise of this film is to depict the horrors that Captain Miller and his men had to endure before, during and after they located Private Ryan, leading to the fundamental question at the end of the film, something about "earn this". You remember don't you?The D-Day scene opens with a caption June 6, 1944. Omaha Beach Dog Green Sector. Although an Allied invasion site, according to my history books Omaha was an AMERICAN objective that resulted in over 2500 casualties.Secondly, the mission was to locate an AMERICAN Private. I doubt that England, Canada, Austrailia or ( fill in the blanks with country of your choice ) would commit troops to locate a lost American. As far as Russia is concerned, most of them were busy on the Eastern Front. While the Americans were traipsing through the countryside, they were heading toward areas where they knew Americans may be, i.e. 101st Airborne rallying points, while at the same time trying to avoid armed conflict with the enemy.I'm sorry if you were insulted by the lack of representation of other Allied troops, but again this film was based on a real American soldier, ( who was actually tracked down by an Army Chaplain) not a British, Canadian or Australian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phew, where do you start? A film that shows at last what bullets and bombs do to the human body. A film that shows that war is not about glory and seeing off a few of the enemy before getting home for tea. It makes me wonder how those men stayed sane when they got home, IF they got home. I found the film compelling and very, very disturbing. All too many American blockbuster films show people blazing away and the nasty men meeting their fate,but this one I believe is as close as a film has got to getting anywhere near the truth, if the vets accounts are anything to go by. And if it is, then I'm bloody glad I wasn't 18 in 1944...The most moving part of the film for me was when the troop attacked some kind of radar installation, on the way to finding Private Ryan. After the attack one chap lies there with bullet holes in his chest, whilst his mates try and help him. Slowly he starts slipping away, and cries out for his mother, and his home. It's a scene that's still with me, weeks after seeing the movie. Another splendid side of the film for me was that there wasn't a clean cut, gung - ho, invincible hero to be seen...just normal, ordinary, and very scared men.Any flaws? Well, for me personally, the very end was a little too sentimental, but that's the directors trade mark, I suppose. All in all, a terrific, pulsating, horrific and terrifying film from my point of view. I don't think I'll ever look at an old man in quite the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Earn this." That means all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have read the many reviews of "Saving Private Ryan," I've noticed, particularly from the more "serious" publications, that "serious" critics insist on separating the bulk of the film from its bookend scenes of Ryan at the Normandy cemetery. Those scenes, I've read several times, are "false," "ham-handed," or "manipulative." They could not be more wrong.These scenes, which begin and end with an American flag shining in the sun, illustrate the gap between the generation of men who crossed through Hell on Earth so that the sun would continue to shine on this country and its liberties, and the succeeding generations who, perhaps, have failed to fully appreciate the debt they owe and the honor due those men who defeated Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan.In the opening, we see an old veteran, walking alone, his wife trailing him, and trailing her, the children and grandchildren. We see the son, acting more like a tourist, whose emotional distance from his father is shown by the intrusive clicking and winding of his camera. Yet, we also see the entire family rushing to his side as he collapses in grief, wanting desperately to comfort him in some way.At the end, we realize that the old man is Ryan, which is perhaps the only flaw in this otherwise magnificent film. For this conflicts with the implication from the beginning when the camera zooms toward the old man's eyes to what seem to be his memories of Omaha Beach. If Ryan dropped behind German lines with the 101st Airborne Division, how could he remember what happened on the beach? After some thought, I figured that Rieben, the one survivor of Omaha Beach in Captain Miller's squad, might well have told Ryan as they made their way back to HQ all that those men who found Ryan went through.Some critics have been particularly critical of the last scene, with Ryan imploring his wife to reassure him that has, indeed, "earned" what Miller's squad did for him. I think the scene has far more depth than its critics have given it credit for, particularly in light of an earlier scene.Recall the lull between the Americans' defense preparations in "Roumel" and the final street battle with SS troops, when Miller (Tom Hanks) and Ryan (Matt Damon) come to know each other a little better in a conversation that cannot help but be disconcerting to Miller.Remarking on Miller's teaching occupation, Ryan jokes that he could never be a teacher himself, having driven his teachers crazy. "You're just like a thousand kids I've seen," Miller says, probably remembering when he said to Sgt. Horvath, "This Ryan had better cure cancer or invent a longer lasting light bulb."That Ryan doesn't seem particularly special is only reinforced when the only clear memory Ryan can dredge from his brain about his brothers is a prank which embarrassed the oldest brother, humiliated a half-naked girl, nearly destroyed the family barn, and shows too clearly that Ryan, for all his incipient nobility in refusing to abandon his brothers in arms, is still a male adolescent for whom the line between humor and cruelty is rather blurred. This makes Miller's tight grin and diplomatic chuckle all the more poignant.As the years passed, I would imagine that Ryan would remember that conversation, and as he matured, realized how superficial he must have seemed to the older Miller, who died that Ryan might live. We can only guess how heavy it would have weighed on Ryan that he could not show Miller the life he had lived since then, and could not finally know whether he had "earned" Miller's gift. I fail to see anything resembling a "false note" here.To the rest of us, the cross with Miller's name, followed by Old Glory in the bright sun speaks to us in two ways. It illustrates at what a price our freedom and well-being have been bought. And with the colors absorbed by the sunlight, thus giving the flag a faded look, it places at our feet Miller's charge to Ryan that he "earn this" with equal urgency. Whether we have earned or squandered this legacy is the question that every person watching "Saving Private Ryan" should take to heart.Finally, a personal note. In 1994, My wife, my son and I had the pleasure of meeting a veteran of the 82nd Airborne Div. When he left for France to participate in the paratrooper reenactment, we shook hands, and I told him how honored I was to have met him. "You're a good man, and you have a beautiful family," he replied. Given the source, I cannot remember ever receiving a higher compliment. A false note? Of course not. And neither is the ending of "Saving Private Ryan."</fullReview>

When they finally find Ryan and decide to stay, there is a small scene in which Ryan tells Tom Hanks about his brothers. Ryan starts this conversation with a question about Tom Hank's wife and her rosegarden (I believe its a rosegarden, but it could as well simply be roses). Tom Hanks does not answer and says that he's going to keep that story to himself. Ryan however does not know anything about his wife....Even though this continues to raise questions for me as to if it's a goof or simply due to a cut, I love the movie!

		<fullReview>Well now - what is that? There seem to be hundreds of comments in here that label this movie "best film ever".What I saw was: a thin story, once again "good heroic Americans" who did "the right thing" (well - occasionally accidentally shot an enemy who already had his hands up - but that can be blamed on the adrenaline flow it seems), faceless soldiers on the "other" side which made it easy for the viewer to concentrate solely on the "good guys". No. This was NOT a good war movie. This was once again a Hollywood product designed to feed the American myth of having died for "the right cause". The final salute to the Captain at the cemetery fit nicely into this picture - I almost seemed to hear "The star-spangled banner"!At the most, this was a movie asking the question why several people had to go rescue one other man. But an anti-war movie? No way! Schindler's List was a movie with many different aspects to think about. Saving Private Ryan still distinguishes between "Americans" and "others". As if the soldiers on the other side didn't die just as horrible. Ah - but I forgot: you save a German, he'll be back later to kill you, so you better execute him the first time. Is that what can be learned here??</fullReview>

It is also clear that after years of having the ridiculous notion of war as cool thrust down our throats, such a horrifying depiction in a genuinely mainstream picture was needed. However after such a dazzlingly brilliant start, when the story kicks in we find Spielberg merely trotting out the old clichés we've seen so many times before. Again we're told how glorious, noble and almost desirable it is to die for our country, how the Germans were little more than cartoon villains, and most sickeningly, through the character of the young interpreter, how the correct response to the horrors of war is to lose your innocent disbelief that this could happen and join in. What makes this so sad is the fact that in the accurate depiction of the battles Spielberg has already shown how hollow these notions are. Death in war is as empty and disgusting as any other painful, violent death; at the level of the ordinary soldier the Allies were as scared and selfish as the Germans; and surely the reaction of the interpreter, as he lay sobbing on the battlefield, out of his mind with fear, is the most honest and sane reaction to mass slaughter one could have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful war film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film with my best friend Jo. We went into the cinema in happy, good moods. We walked out in floods of tears. The two of us sat, through almost the entire film, gripping onto each others hands. A film has never done this to me before, and I thought Titanic was bad! The acting was superb and the special affects were amazing. It really made you feel as if you were there. Even though in real life, so I'm told, the lives of eight men would not have been risked for saving just one, I feel that the rest of the film was as real as it good be. Spielberg deserves a medal for this one.</fullReview>

As a person twice removed from the war generation (18 years of age), my only experience from the great World War II were from films such as "The Longest Day" and "Patton", all seemed to make me want to make a contribution equivalent, as far as fighting for my country, but after seeing "Saving Private Ryan" I wish to make a contribution as equal to those who fought and died, but I no longer wish to endure that hardship, and that is a luxury we as a generation can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to understand how any person could have survived battles so superbly shown here;and this is the ultimate 'reality' film on war, horror, and courage ever made. Its message is so powerful all young folk should see it to understand how 'lucky' we the 'Allies' were to finally beat the Germans - we, the citizen soldiers so well shown, up against the terrifying enemy, who literally fought to the bitter end. The 'cost' is seen in the cemeteries in Europe &amp; Asia; for me the US 8th AF near Cambridge, England; Normandy, France; and Rangoon, Burma are like this film, important and necessary reminders of how much I owe to so many to enjoy life here in the United States.</fullReview>

You actually feel for them, which IMO only a few war films seem to bring.The opening scene(Omaha Beach) I would rate up there as one of the greatest scenes in movie history!. The realism, the camera swaying all over the place going in and out of the water, the bullets whizzing past and the screaming. Its just bloody amazing and so full on that it can't be topped!.I have watched this movie countless times and it still never gets old to me.10/10 a memorable movie that is a must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1998 war/drama film "Saving Private Ryan" directed by Steven Spielberg was an incredible film that was very realistic and had a storyline that kept viewers captivated until the very end. The film was rated R due to its gory war scenes and use of profanity. No young child should see the violence that this film captured to create realistic war scenes. The setting of this movie was the Invasion of Normandy during World War II. The explicit scenes had blood pouring out of soldiers, soldiers with limbs cut off, men screaming and shaking, and soldiers being shot. All of this captured the brutality of World War II in such a way that the audience could feel the adrenaline and fear that each one of those soldiers would have been facing out on the battle field. The gruesomeness of the movie forces the viewer to have respect for the soldiers for moving forward with their duties even though they are surrounded by death of not only their enemies but their friends. The special effects throughout the entire movie were incredible. The explosions of fire and dust were very realistic to an actual bomb going off. All of the sounds of gun shots gave the image of a battle field even when one closed their eyes. It had to have taken a lot of effort to put together scenes where so many men were shot in various places. The opening battle scene, where the United States Army was trying to secure Omaha Beach was almost as if World War II was recorded and the real footage was put into the movie. Men had blood spewing out of their wounds where they were shot, some of their limbs were completely gone, and one man laid on the ground holding his intestines into his body. Another scene had a soldier being held by his friends after being shot many times. Each wound had blood pouring out of it so realistically that I had to turn away from the screen. These are just a few examples of the almost too realistic wounds that could make the audience feel nauseous if they were too squeamish about blood.The storyline to the movie was one that could capture the attention of a wide range of audiences. It was a movie on history, war, friendships, comradery and family. Several of the infantry members sent on the mission to find a man who lost all of his brothers to war could not understand why they had to risk their lives to tell a single man he was allowed to go home. Many of them started out their journey mocking the boy, saying he would not be worth it. When they finally found him and told him that he was allowed to go home and he refused to leave the men he was with behind, it sparked a fire in the men that the audience could see. The inspiration the audience felt when a man who just found out he had lost three of his brothers stays to help defend the people in his unit was overwhelming. Not only did he stay and so did the rest of the men who came to find him, but most of those men died willingly to protect their country and save the young boy to give him a chance at going home alive.Tom Hanks portrayed Captain Miller, one of the main characters throughout the movie. He did a fantastic job with presenting the characters mental dilemmas. We see him struggling throughout the movie with an uncontrollable shaking hand but whenever someone asked if he was alright, he avoided the question and just moved on. We are able to tell that the war is taking a toll on his mental health because often we see him staring off, hearing nothing, when he is in the middle of combat. The viewer sympathizes because we see the tremendous amount of stress he is under. He sees all of the same things that the soldiers he is commanding are, yet he has to remain strong and act as though none of the brutality phases him. The movie ends in a heart wrenching scene where Captain Miller dies saving Private Ryan, even though he had the chance to go home and see his wife before he made the decision to stay and help defend the small group of men Private Ryan did not want to abandon. His final words hit home to Private Ryan and the audience as he tells Private Ryan to "earn it". The impact that those two words had on Private Ryan are taken throughout his life because at the end of the movie we see him getting emotional in front of Captain Millers grave, where he asks his wife if he was a decent man. It was a tear jerking moment as the audience got to whiteness a grown soldier asking for the respect of a man who died saving his life. All 170 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" were captivating and exhilarating. As I sat watching the film I felt as though I was on the battle field with these men getting to know each and every one of them. Each personality came through even if they did not speak many words. This film is a 5 star movie and is worth seeing because it will have you trying to fight back the tears, whether male or female at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is beautiful. It's emotional. It's violent. And it's probably the best movie set in a war ever made. It is a truly epic. Spielberg's directing here is phenomenal. Every cast member give great performances, making every character memorable. The set design is also marvelous. As I said earlier, this movie is violent. And not just over the top violence that you may find in a Quentin Tarantino movie. This violence is very real. It's horrifying to watch hundreds of soldiers die in the Ohama Beach scene. But without that brutality, this movie wouldn't have worked. It needed to affect its audience. It needed to provide a realistic look at World War II. And it worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living the war with Private Ryan."Saving Private Ryan" is a fantastic film by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodatin colors which was produced in 1998 in America. It's a wonderful war, drama and action film about World War II. We find such well-known actors as Tom Hanks (playing the role of Captain John Miller), Tom Sizemore (playing the role of Sergeant Michael Horvath), Edward Burns (as Private Reiben), Barry Pepper (as Private Jackson), Matt Damon (as the role of Private Ryan), Adam Goldberg (as Private Mallish) and Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo.While the Allied Force land to Omaha Beach, Miller has to lead his platoon behind the enemy lines for a dangerous mission : find and return safe and sound Private James Francis Ryan, who's got three brothers who died in the fight within three days. While the platoon progresses on enemy territory, Miller's men wonder themselves : is it necessary to risk the life of eight men to save the only one from it ? The acting presence of the actors is successful, we feel different emotions with actors, the pain when, for instance, two policemen announce to Mrs. Ryan that her three sons are dead. There is no dialogue and it makes us understand that there are no words to talk about death. We can't put some words, some "good" words not to destroy somebody to soften the pain. Steven Spielberg Reveals that. We can see this old woman falling down on the ground, devastated and this scene tear our heart. Sometimes, the camera zooms on a soldier's face and we feel deeply in our chest that they are petrified and they transmit this feeling very well.This film is visually breath-taking, because of the landscapes and the sets are so realistic that we lose ourselves in them and live , discover the atrocities of the war at the same time as the soldiers. We follow them, we belong to the platoon. And on top of that, sometimes we are surprised to hear an explosion, to see the ground explode as fireworks, as if it were next to us. It permits the spectator to live the war as never. We are both an actor and a soldier.The story line is down-to-earth : first, there is no love story like in "Pear Harbor" which gives a "sweet side" to the story. Here, there are only blood, bravery, brotherhood, fights and a duty to fulfill. It permits the spectator to really know what happened during D-Day. Moreover, even the good characters die, some scenes are violent, for instance, when a German stabs a Jew very slowly to make him suffer because it's important to say that during World War II, Germans tried to eliminate all the Jews : it's called a genocide. This film doesn't hide the reality of war.But this beautiful and fantastic film reveals something about soldiers during World War II : they were both loving and ruthless. They are presented as survivors and heroes (soldiers are always filmed with the high angle shot except when they are crying or dying because at this moment they are weak), respectful men, brave because they face danger even if they are afraid because they are willing to fulfill their duty for their country, wives and children. And we can see this at the beginning of the film when the American soldiers land to Normandy. Tom Hanks appears totally lost, his helmet on the floor, he discovers the nightmare of war. He could have given up, but we can finally see a light of determination on his eyes and all of a sudden, he catches his helmet and put it on his head : he really wants to achieve his duty. He's courageous. Soldiers also appear self-sacrificing and brotherhood is highlighted in this film. Because they landed together and they will come back home together, no matter what? The music by John Williams contributes to release feelings deep in the chest of the spectator. And music is useful to carve the image of the soldier. We have a patriotic music when, for instance, a soldier talks about his life at home with his family, to show that they are heroes and that they will come back home or to show that they had to leave them behind to accomplish their duty for the country. So the spectator is totally overwhelmed with feelings thanks to music which makes soldiers appear both brave and heart-broken because they miss their family. And we can identify ourselves to them ; it's a very moving film which turns our hearts upside down.This film received two awards : in 1999, Steven Spielberg got a Golden Globe for the Best Director of a Motion Picture with "Saving Private Ryan". Then, in 1999, the film "Saving Private Ryan" received a Golden Globe for the best Motion Picture. Moreover, the film received some good critics : The New York Times said "This film simply looks at war as if war had not been looked at before." Which was very positive. In The city Review, Carter B. Horsley said "With extreme gore, deep sincerity, fabulous cinematography and great acting, "Saving Private Ryan" is a stupendous movie."."Saving Private Ryan" is a film which remains important in time, it echoes to the past, without lies. It presents World War II soldiers as self-sacrificing heroes and they can be fathers, brothers too : they have a heart. "Saving Private Ryan" will never stop moving us and make us admire what soldiers did, to help us to live in the world that we know nowadays.By Sangiorgio Marine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film contains one of the best war scenes i have ever seen. I am talking about the D-Day (the landing and the effort of the Americans to break Germans defenses). It is so realistic. Plenty of shooting, bombing, killing. Really breathtaking. I have read many history books and articles and i think the recreation of this battle is epic. I can admit that since i first saw this movie when i read a new article regarding this battle, the scenes of this movie come in mind. Only a few movies or serials have so intense battle depictions.One that comes in mind is the serial Band of Brothers. Of course not only this part of the movie, but the whole movie is worth to be seen. Enjoy it, surely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been an avid fan of war films ever since I was a kid. I was fond of seeing movies where soldiers are holding out on their own and winning against their opponent even though the odds are overwhelmingly against them. That's why when I got to see Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, I instantly got hooked. The realism of the movie is great and it showed me another side of the war ? its gruesomeness. It made me realize that no matter what rank or whether that person is of utmost importance, it won't matter in front of a speeding bullet heading towards his head or a mortar about to land near him. The way the movie was depicted, blown-off body parts and all, was very real that it sometimes made me shiver whenever I think that I was that person getting shot ? lucky me, huh? The portrayal of each of the cast was unbelievably real, especially that part where the general was about to send that letter to Ryan's mother and his story ? I really got emotional right there. Well, I'm not going to spoil you the details, especially if you haven't watched it yet. The movie is a must watch and there are numbers that can prove it. In a nutshell, Saving Private Ryan is a movie that deserves to be called "the best".</fullReview>

If Spielberg has added the directorial ingredient then Tom Hanks has ensured the perfect cooking of the added ingredient. The movie scores highly on emotional content by balancing the war scenarios. Added onto that is the amazing music given by John Williams, which further takes the movie to new heights. In fact, the music resonates with the heart and soul of the viewer and delivers the essence of this fine art remarkably. The last few words by Capt. Miller "James earn this... Earn it".. really leave the profound impact on the heart reaching out to the every nook and corner of it. Tom Hanks has always been a treat to eyes and I was never disappointed after watching his movies. And this movie escalates him to the newer heights.

		<fullReview>To call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement. What Spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making. This is emotional, unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there. Now is this the most original story ever told? No. The storm of Normandy has been shown before. The story has been told before. (This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most real battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there. (Some could not finish watching the scene) So if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie. See this! It centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world. To be clear though, this movie is not just about that war. The story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a man.OK, how about the rest of the movie? The searching and hopefully the rescue of Private Ryan? Excellent! You will be interested and want to know what happens. A great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end. Oh and Mr. Spielberg does a fantastic job in book ending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all together.I original saw this with my dad on it's original release in theaters. After the movie I asked him what he thought. He literally could not speak for like twenty minutes. You walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie. A small glimpse of our history and US as human beings enduring all the horror, war, laughter, tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... I've seen this movie once before, and I decided to watch it again this evening and it had the same effect on me that it did the first time I watched it. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that stays with you long after you watch it.It is affecting and moving, gritty and powerful. You watch this film and you see the hell that is war.You see what it does to people, it dehumanizes them , it strips away their moral compass, their values.The movie is violent and sickeningly realistic, but its violence and graphic scenes are not numbing, you are never detached from the what the soldiers are going through. You watch the action unfold and you are there, you are there feeling the pain of the soldiers.Steven Spielberg has once again drawn us in emotionally to the story. Just as he did with Schindler's list, he uses his gift for compelling story telling and character development, to immerse us in the story,to make us care for the characters.The acting was top notch as well. Tom Hanks,as Capt. John Miller, did an amazing job,probably one of his best roles(besides Forrest Gump and Philadelphia) as did Matt Damon (Private Ryan). The whole cast was perfect and fit right into each of their roles. The underlying score of John Williams, one of my favorite score composers(E.T, Jurassic Park, Star wars, etc.),was used in the right moments,creating tension and at other times, tugging at your heart strings.One of the best movies by Spielberg and ONE of the best WWII movies(not the best but one of them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a masterpiece. A tribute to the greatest generation and those who serve during WWII.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that it didn't win Best Picture is outrageous. It was great from start to finish. The opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional. The music score by John Williams is amazing. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story of a mission following the D-day invasion. The movie starts Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. His mission to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him back to the United States so that it can save the family's bloodline and help softly the mother's grief. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore starts as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. I understand the everyman quality of the average soldier. There were also a lot of actors that you wouldn't have thought for once, playing soldiers as supporting characters such as Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and Paul Giamatti. Who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever. I like how the characters were written with everyday blue-collar Joes. It gives the movie realistic. They are brave while scare. Good, but also bit morally reprehensible. A great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a German Soldier. All of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free. It's toward the middle of the film, that the violence of the film dies down enough, to get a few character development. It was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here. Some people thinks that the movie glorified war or it's over patriotism. I think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war. In movies that glorify war, there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply don't represent the soldiers who fought in war. In Saving Private Ryan, the characters are down-to-earth-ordinary. This movie also shows that in war, there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive. It portrays war as what it is: violent and ugly. As pure hell. As for patriotism, I don't believe that the film is patriotism. There are scenes of American soldiers being as crude, cowardly, or just mean-spirited as some of the German's soldiers. I don't think the Germans are portray unfairly. About the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an American film presented to an American audience. Would it had been nice to see a British soldier in the film? Yes, but it wasn't needed in the film. The film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war, while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got. The film was balance between pro war and anti-war themes. Yes, there were a few historic accurates that wasn't corrected, but overall, many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. The first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the Normandy Invasion. The visuals are grainy, de-colorized, and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then, and since after Saving Private Ryan, many directors have used for their war films. The audio is astounding, and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film. Exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional, positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings. After this movie came out, I saw an interview with several D-Day survivors. They all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen. It was like they were there again. That is strong praise from someone who would know. Every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film. Show them how it really was. It's not what it is. Overall: It is a must-watch. It's a story of normal, average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very good (WAR) movie. Just a fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many things are flawed in this fiction, which seems to be far away from reality. This does not touch at any point. Better than "Saving Pvt. Ryan" are "the Pianist", "Downfall", and even "Apocalypse Now". And even the TV series of "The Pacific" is a lot better. I am not a historian, so I may not be 100% correct in many of my thoughts. But in my opinion the kind of sentiments that have been shown in this movie by the military and Military General --- is unbelievable, and somehow ridiculous. Especially if it is related to World War 2, and when America is just getting up from the great depression. Why one boy is so important who had been admitted to the Army to serve his country. Now Army wants to protect this Baby!!! Funny. Every soldier has a Mom and Wife and family. At many times when the soldiers should shoot the enemy, they are letting him walk away in the name of POW. That kind of kindness never happens in reality. And I listened a lot about the opening 30 minutes scene, that it is really fantastic. But it was horrible. The opening scene of "Shooter" was much more realistic and exciting. Why the Army will land on the beach in such a suicidal way, for the massacre of their own men??? This is just a good action movie like Black Hawk Down, or Matt Damon's Green Zone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental film about D-Day has both flaws and merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another piece of American candy from Uncle Steven. Does anybody here cares about Ryan anyway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, I couldn't get into this movie. Too unbelievable. First, three brothers are killed within hours in 2 different fronts (one in Utah beach, of all places!) And I guess they were all struck by the same meteor. And then, didn't they have radios in that war? Why didn't they just send a radio message to the 101 to locate Ryan and send him to the rear? That would have been more logical than to send some grunts to look for the proverbial needle in haystack. Anyway, this is the most interesting Spielberg film I've seen, if only because it shows his shortcomings as filmmaker. Let's be clear: there are really two movies here, rather three, which show his inability to cope with 160 minutes of good, consistent, cinema in just one swoop of a movie. The first film is, of course, the reenactment on the Omaha landing, the best part of the whole and the only one worth seeing. Excellent cinematography, especially the hand--held--camera trick, which is mostly appropriate here but which later became annoying as Spielberg seems to have fallen in love with it, to the point of using it in even the most trivial sequences. Anyway, good film overall (But what's the point, when I can watch authentic footage from Iwo Jima, Tarawa and so on?) The second movie is interesting, because you can compare it to another film with an almost identical plot: AN. In both we have a military team who goes looking for a man in a war ravaged land, with Hanks playing here the role Martin Sheen played there. And with the difference that in this case they go to save Ryan while in AN they go to kill Kurtz. Put both films together and you'll see why AN is a masterpiece while SPR is just a wannabe. The first thing Coppola did when confronted to his plot was to set a strong link between Willard &amp; Kurtz. In AN, Willard is regularly informed about Kurtz; Kurtz is ever present, he's like a cloud hovering above the boat. In SPR instead Ryan is just an abstraction, he's mostly irrelevant in the plot, he doesn't exist. That is why this (second) film threatens to fall apart from the beginning--as Spielberg failed in establishing such a link--and why he had to recur to diverse, rather random, elements to keep the story afloat. This explains the episodic nature the movie takes, with the addition of elements disconnected from each other, which served no useful role in the plot; for ex., that absurd tug of war around the French girl. Or the foul up about the wrong Ryan?which I'm told now it's funny. The attack on the radar station is also gratuitous, as it doesn't give us any additional info on the context. This brings me to the subject of the context itself.I see that the most vocal critics of SPR here are the Brits, which feel cheated of their role in that war. I would ask them: what war? I don't see any war here, just a landing and then some random shooting. You wouldn't even know there's a war going on, as NO context is given. There you got another difference with AN. But Hanks and his men are no much different than Willard and his crew in that boat, they constitute a universe apart from the war, independent from it, but inserted in it anyway. But there we see Coppola's genius too; he doesn't lose the least occasion to keep tensions high in the group, by giving a sharp edge to each member especially to Willard and making them constantly collide. In SPR instead, added to the almost total absence of such edges, Willard's equivalent is played by the last actor I would have chosen for the part. Hanks can only play all around nice, honest guys. He's so nice that, even when he caused the stupid death of one of his subordinates, he didn't cause any turmoil in his platoon. So nice I didn't even feel sad for his death, knowing he was going straight to Heaven.If the second film is at best uneven, with strong sequences--Wade's death--alternating with bad ones--tug of war for the girl--the third film is a waste of time. That 45-minute battle served no purpose, as nothing new is added to the mix. In most war movies men go into action with still unsettled issues between them--as Mallory &amp; Miller in GON--or with themselves--the "coward" who has to prove himself for ex., but not here. We already know these guys are heroes, we have seen them for the past 2 hours. We also know they are 100% loyal to their chief. So what's the point in showing them for almost an entire hour still doing the same...?BTW, the only reason why there were so many casualties in Omaha is that the yanks refused to use specially designed British tanks-the Funnies-- that could have saved many lives.The waste of time, the cartoon Germans, the superfluous flag cost the movie 3 pts. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No ideology can resist such a piece of cinema triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I visited the forums, read reviews in IMDb, read reviews of critics, talked to the people around me and as I see, people are not excited about the movie like me, it means that they don't see the greatness of the movie? or are there some other reasons? I want to give the example of The Terminator 2. If you have seen the movie, you know that, according to many people, it is the greatest action movie ever made. In IMDb, you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie. Firstly, I want to talk about that, why Saving Private Ryan is not appreciated in its genre, war like The Terminator 2? People are very cold towards this movie, as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie. Or they say that Omaha Beach sequence was cool (enough?) but the rest was bad. Now, at this point, I want to say that now I am writing a review on the movie which to me, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is pure cinema, maybe not a work of art, but a truly cinematic experience. Direction, the cinematography, editing, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects (briefly mise-en-scene) are great, the shots are great. You know, if a war movie includes action, people say that disliked it, because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic, but what if this is the style of the director? The Thin Red Line was also very artistic, but is this really a flaw? Returning to the content or the messages of the film, people say propaganda, militarist, one sided etc. As a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda, I don't care about ideology while thinking about this movie. As for one sided criticism, always the same, it shows the enemy side as evil. Does somebody have to make two movies like Clint Eastwood if he makes a war movie? Well, if you ask me, No. By the way, the scene which the German soldier sings an American march is criticized, so people say Spielberg humiliates Germans. If you want to 'read' it like that, do it, but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene. The best (or the most horrible?) D-Day interpretation is here. At this point, as said before, a lot of people think that just Omaha Beach sequence was just cool. I think it is more than that. Also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success. Lastly, in the middle of the movie, there is a sequence, it rains and later they find a little girl, that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far more than just a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg accomplished something here; something that may rival Schindler's List as his masterpiece and the greatest work he ever did in his extraordinary career. Here, with this film, he shows a side of World War II we all have read about but never saw. While he couldn't completely make it a reality, watching this movie is about as close as any of us will get to experiencing such historical events like D-Day. That being said, this is so much more than just a film that chronicles the story of eight men sent to find one in the German-controlled areas of France. Spielberg here paints a picture of the price and the consequences of war and certainly doesn't glamorize anything. The first half hour of the film is almost exclusively set right in the middle of the action as US forces storm Omaha Beach and try to stay alive amidst the torrential downpour of bullets and bombs. This scene alone earned Spielberg the Best Director Oscar and makes this film one of the great war films of all time. Still, he takes it to another level and gives us characters that we can view as simple everyday men on a mission that they don't believe in trying to find a man they know or care nothing about. To be frank, this is more than a film. It is more than an experience. It is a lesson on war and the complications it brings and the sacrifice it requires. That is what makes this a classic and maybe the best war film ever made. These men gave all they could and something most of us will never have to worry about; they gave their lives and in turn saved so many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually rich with a stunning and honest depiction of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of us can't truly say we know what World War II looked like, but I would venture to say that Steven Spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with "Saving Private Ryan." Spielberg, in his second attempt to capture the WWII era on the big screen, has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiers.Worthy of the most praise is the incredibly well-deserved second Oscar win for the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski. The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.Here is wear "Ryan" succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do. Those of us who aren't veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of many of my favorite Tom Hanks movies and also Steven Spielberg's too. This is movie is rated as the best war movie ever made and I felt same after watching this movie.The especialty of this movie is the characters in the movie and all the actors played their part with par excellence. The movie is very much able to show the grief of the mothers and families. Major attraction of the movie also includes the combat scenes from the movie.Although people can say that Tom Hanks character as the lead or main role of the movie but I say that all characters were major in this movie and that was because Steven Spielberg distributed the screen space so well between all the characters of the movie that you never feel that any of the character is left out or suppressed.Tom Hanks character is filled of different shades where he shows his intelligence with some brilliant strategy to win the battle at the coast then at the same character can seen weeping in the middle of battle field remembering his life post the war.The dialogs in the movie are also very touching. I personally really liked the scene when the Army supreme (don't remember much about him) reads out a letter by president "Abraham Lincoln" showing condolence to the a mother who lost all of her kids in the war for the nation.If you have not seen this movie due to any reason then I would recommend you to buy a DVD and watch it with whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just leave it up to the genius of a master like Steven Spielberg to depict WW II in all it's gruesomeness, chaos and inhumanity. This is about the only war-movie that I have ever seen where you just simply become stunned, overwhelmed and shocked by a pandemonium of apocalyptic pictures, sounds and dialogs who ring nothing but true. This film doesn't shy away from stating a simple message, the message that war dehumanizes the human mind and bares open a bestiality that ponders on the verge of uneducated seaweed in terms of emotions. I congratulate you, Steven Spielberg, for being brave and courageous in your way of showing us that war is hell, that it is tedious, brutal, sometimes even boring but most important of all: definitely no laughing matter. This honest and depressing examination of the human condition should definitely have won the Best-Picture-Oscar in 1980. Oh wait, I just realized that this isn't the comment-board for "1941"... sorry, my mistake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie from a Great Moviemaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>great movie.. from a great director but what else is new? I really like the movie and I will tell you why but let me first quote the even greater Charles Bukowski: "You begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; all else is grandiose romantism or politics." well lets emphasis on the romantism because romantism is the genre of this movie. why? What do the soldiers represent in the war - the simple man. The simple man in extraordinary circumstances - romantism, a genre in Literature. The war is the extraordinary circumstance and the "one man at a time" is private Ryan. Now most of the negativism about the movie comes from the grandiose story but Spielberg presents the story with historical facts so the film doesn't feel too distant or too Hollywood. The Camera follows the actors in the sand and the piles of dead bodies. We see guts, blood, limbs. We see from their point of view while the battle unfolds. Spielberg has always had "an eye" for the photography but here he puts it to the limit. His vision is undeniable because its personal and because its a movie, it brings out a world before the viewers eyes and they cant judge the characters who by the way are perfectly created by the actors, Tom Hanks in a blowing-our-minds-of-performance, because its an extraordinary circumstance in which the simple man tries to figure out a way to survive or to do the right thing.In the end the old Ryan ask if he has lived a good life, if he is a good person, if he has earned it as Capt. Miller aka Tom Hanks told him before he died. In a way the movie is philosophical but I think that it is more like a book, you read it and think about it - what it means and what it is about, in contexts means, because its a great movie, it does what a great movie does - says what it suppose to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion saving private Ryan is the most entertaining and realistic war movie you can find to have been released. It takes place during ww2 and starts out with the invasion of Normandy known as d-day shown as excruciatingly violent. Right after this 8 men receive a mission to find a private Ryan because his other three brothers have already died in the war. The men begin to wonder why the 8 of them are risking their lives to save just another soldier. Tom Hank gives a very good performance as the leader of the team who keeps the group together when things start to go wrong. Tom Sizemore is the second man in command, Ed Burns is the soldier who doesn't like the mission more than anyone of them, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davies are three other soldiers in the group. Vin Diesel and Giovonni Ribisi are the two men who die before they find Private Ryan played by Matt Damon. The movie is 2 and 3/4 hours long but move along fast and ends before you know it. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on something special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is such a powerful and necessary film and one everyone should watch at one point in their life.It's a simple story; a small group of soldiers are given a mission to retrieve the last surviving of four brothers from behind enemy lines in France. The symbolism of this story and of Ryan himself are profound and personal for all of us today who are partakers of the rights and freedoms given to those liberated by the allied invasion of Europe. The graphic depiction of what these men went through to establish that freedom gives us a difficult reminder of how much we each as individuals owe these men ? veterans that are still with us actually went through this! I remember feeling so grateful for their sacrifice, and I left the cinema not so much entertained but shaken. The depth and accuracy of this film remains a testament and a tribute to those brave people, and not the filmmakers themselves. The acting is honest and superb, and the characters are as rich and interesting and ordinary as the real soldiers they could represent. The first time I watched this it was difficult to watch and there were several times when I had to just look away. A technical marvel, an incredible achievement for Steven Spielberg, who remains for me the greatest filmmaker ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Horrific Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After directing such films as Jaws, E.T., and Schindler's List, I don't think that anybody thought that Steven Spielberg could do anything better.Well, he did.Saving Private Ryan, the greatest war film ever made, is undoubtedly Spielberg's masterpiece. Forget that it lost the Best Picture Academy Award to the utterly forgettable Shakespeare in Love; This film transcends all other war films before it, and will continue to be the standard for all war films after it.From the very first gunshot on the beaches of Normandy (which is still the most shockingly brilliant scene in any movie in history) until the final shot is fired in the small French town at the end of the movie (quite possibly the 2nd most shockingly brilliant scene in history), the movie grabs your attention and refuses to let go. You squirm as the camera follows brave soldiers into the heat of battle out of fear of being shot yourself, and you feel each soldier's pain when one of their own falls in combat. After Private Ryan's thank you to Captain Miller at the end of the movie, we can't help but thank Captain Miller along with him. And we thank Spielberg, too, for creating one of the best films of all time for us to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 stars for realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several critiques of this movie claiming that the opening sequence and continuing doctrine are "unrealistic". These "Experts" claim that the opening scene is far too bloody and doesn't accurately describe what the fighting would have been like, and that the standard operating procedures of the squad are "Hollywood".I challenge these "experts" to put aside their ideology and bias and look at how a military operation actually works and what is involved.The Normandy invasion was the largest movement of troops and personal in the history of the world, and that mere accomplishment stands with the building of the Pyramids or the Hanging Gardens. It was a classic case of "being willing to pay the butcher's bill" for a victory. Saying that there were only 10% casualties is accurate, but it is an insult to the bravery of the 34,250 men that landed on the most heavily fortified real estate in the world. And especially to those going in the first wave, where casualties were known to be the highest (in some cases over 80%). 34,250 men don't all step off onto the beach at the same time."Saving Private Ryan" opens with the first wave of troop carriers going on to Omaha Beach. The defenders are there waiting for them, and therefore the casualty rates among these units will be high. The opening scene accurately describes this. My grandfather was part of the second wave onto Omaha and his eyewitness testimony confirms this.The breakdown of US casualties was 1465 dead, 3184 wounded, 1928 missing (presumed dead) and 26 captured. In the Annals of American History, only Antietam ranks higher in American casualties suffered in a single day.Several Airborne Rangers I've interviewed (including my father &amp; grandfather) remark on the realism of the squad's interaction. These were not people sneaking through a jungle afraid of being ambushed, these were men that knew that surrounding territory was largely abandoned or populated by French that are hoping to be liberated. Virtually any patrol they encounter would be mechanized and be audible miles away.As for being able to "pick up a radio and contact Ryan's unit to get him out", units in World War II were often out of radio contact for days, occasionally weeks, at a time and had to operate autonomously. There were no GPS satellites and no cell phones. Many soldiers didn't understand French or German. Getting lost was common and a wrong turn would mean hours of delay and confusion. While I can't say the mission made a lot of sense to me from a military point of view, once the mission was ordered this was about the only way it could have been carried out.And yes, rank insignia was displayed (in muted color) on helmets of officers, just as it is today.</fullReview>

It is a very emotional soundtrack which I have listened to many times. All ten tracks are amazing and it's very hard to pick a favourite from them, although: 1. Hymn to the Fallen 2. Revisiting Normandy 3. Omaha Beach 4.Wade's Death Are most probably my favourites. This is a must see and must own film. I rarely rate films 10/10 but this sure means that score. 10/10.</fullReview>

Edward Burns and Tom Sizemore are my favorites personally bet the entire cast really went well together. It was jipped when it didn't win the best picture Oscar for 1998. I mean Shakespeare in Love is a great movie, but I think that the patriotism exemplified in Saving Private Ryan is far more worthy of an Oscar than a romance film.

		<fullReview>After the assault on Omaha beach, a group of US soldiers, led by Cpt Miller (Hanks), are sent on a mission to retrieve the sole surviving Ryan brother (Damon). Success will earn them the right to return home.After giving a definitive representation of the holocaust with the excellent "Schindler's List" and of slavery with "Amistad", Spielberg surprised the world again. "Saving Private Ryan" is a synergy of old "men on a mission" style war films, yet completely redefined how conflicts are to be portrayed on film. The film set a tone of savagery, violence and futility that has marked all war films since (and was perfected in Ridley Scott's awesome "Black Hawk Down"). As a visualist and action director, Spielberg can count this film as yet another resounding triumph. Whenever the tension goes up, as in the horrific opening battle (cinema's most visceral 20 minutes) or the closing siege, Saving Private Ryan surpasses almost any war film in existence.the film is sadly not without its problems, and it is truly regrettable that Robert Rodat's script isn't up to the standards of Spielberg's direction. Whenever the tension dies down and leaves room for character moments, the film comes dangerously close to silliness or sappiness, ticking many of the worst genre clichés in ways that could make it seem like a flag-waiver despite the obvious overall absurdity the film tries to convey. It is a tribute to the acting talents of Damon, Burns, Ribisi, Sizemore and especially Hanks that the film survives such moments, even if a lame last scene undermines the film's power.Despite its flaws, "Saving Private Ryan" has proved its importance and relevance through the considerable influence it has had on cinema action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Saving Private Ryan' is not meant to glorify war, rather, it tries to show the audience the pain and suffering of not soldiers, but people.Beginning with the fateful D-Day which has influenced popular video games and other war movies, a company of soldiers is given the mission of pulling a private out from the war front. Confused and annoyed at this objective, the soldiers travel across Normandy in search of someone they never knew, let alone cared about.The band of soldiers have a hard time coming to terms with such an obscure mission. However, they cannot bail out of the objective. After all, they are in the army. Obeying orders can be the difference between winning or losing.Steven Spielberg masterfully creates a duality in the characters: at once they are soldiers, yet at heart they are only civilians. The cast of characters are exceptional: Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks), keeps the group together and just wants to get the objective over and done with. Pvt. Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the Godfearing soldier who believes his Lord has given him such talent with the sniper rifle. Pvt. Richard Reibens (Edward Burns) is the one who questions the authority, and feels the mission is unnecessary, and the rest round up the company beautifully. These men are not cookie cutter soldiers: They talk with each other, have feelings, reflect upon their actions; Spielberg brings out the 'other' side of the men at war, and this is what the audience (especially war veterans) can relate to.The direction is great. Spielberg's shots are moving: War is dirty and horrifying, and the bonding between the soldiers are sensitive scenes. The cinematography is excellent, some of the best I have seen from any movie. The sound aspects are just as good, if not better, in depicting the harshness of war.'Saving Private Ryan' is a movie not to be missed, partly because it is arguably the greatest war movie ever made, and partly because it will deter those from the idea of another great war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a high school student, and recently, before a trip to visit the D-Day beaches in Normandy, we had a vet who was a medic on D-Day come in and talk to our class. We asked him about his experiences AT D-Day, and he was disinclined to talk too much about it, but said that the first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" were like a newsreel. He even told a story briefly about trying to save a man, dragging the man behind him, only to discover after a little ways that he only had the top half of the man, and that the rest had been blown off, which was actually depicted in the movie. I really appreciated the artistic qualities of the movie as well. The muted color added a somber atmosphere to the movie, and the way Spielberg used realistic equipment and sound effects really impressed me. His set for the invasion was incredibly accurate- when I first viewed the movie, I thought it had been filmed on location. Thumbs up, Steve!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to see both the horrors of war and the evolution of warfare.But more affecting is the individual and group interactions of the ensemble in SPR - spoken and unspoken - and Spielberg's direction, which made war real, in its terror, ambiguousness, and heroism.Tom Hanks as Cap. Miller is the commanding officer you dream of, warts and all, and his command comes together around him loyally, even in FUBAR situations, in a group of outstanding and heartbreaking performances.The final scenes are among the most suspenseful in war film-making. I still get chills, and feel fear as if I was on the front lines myself.If you're a vet, watch with caution, there are triggers. If you are not a vet, then make a point to watch these two movies so you can know what our vets and soldiers endure in war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good war film but...................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually a big fan of Spielberg,but in this film he comes across as a bit to anti-German,he may have his reasons and i think he has made them clear in Schindlers List,and i understand his feelings.But i think for a big epic like this it would have been better to have an unbiased portrayal of Germans so the film would have been universally admired,instead its coming across as anti-German propaganda especially when there is so much American flag-waving.Being English i have the same problem with Braveheart,Scots=good English=bad,this is really one dimensional character study,which just teaches people to live in ignorance,we all need to learn to move on.Surely its better to make films every culture is going to relate to,flag waving just promotes arrogance which leads to looking down on others.The other big problem i have with this film is that the Brits are not mentioned,or if we are i must have missed it,i must have blinked.This was a decisive battle and i know like thousands of other Brits we were involved,so whats the big idea?It would be like us making a film about the Somme or Ypes and not bothering to mention the Canadian and Australian involvement,that would be unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest War Fim Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this film on DVD for my birthday and I couldn't wait to watch it because I had heard some stuff about the movie being very good. After I saw it I had a much better understanding of how bad war really is. I mean you show a seen at Omaha beach on Jun 6,1944 and the moment the ramps go down already the first three or four rows of solider literally get blown to bits. After that you see more solider get shot, killed, and wounded until some solider finally get up to the bunkers and take out the Nazis's, and to top all that off you see the beach after it covered with dead bodies and big puddles of blood. then you hear that 8 men have to save 1 man who lost all three of his brothers and after more violence you see that of the 8 men sent out only 2 are still alive. I can't think of any reason why you couldn't be moved by this film. This is a must see film for anyone interested in war films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most spectacular War Movies you will ever see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I have to say that 'Saving Private Ryan' is a modern masterpiece, and that negative criticism is basically aimed at opportunities which failed to make this the greatest movie ever made.The plot is simple - Captian Miller, played by Tom Hanks, and his squad of soldiers are given a new assignment following the Normandy Invasion: to find Private James Ryan, played by Matt Damon, who happened to be a paratrooper of the 101st Airborne.The War scenes, despite being truly upsetting and gruesomely realistic, are visually fantastic. The attention to detail by Spielberg is fantastic. The full frame is filled with explosions and whizzing bullets, not to mention with the main subject. However, there is not ONE British soldier in France. Not a single soldier. This definitely doesn't overshadow what I personally think is one of the best movies ever made.The movie has no message. The movie is more sentimental, acknowledging the past, and what our older generation went through in order to keep our country safe, as well as to protect our current, or their future generation. We all know we owe it all to those soldiers. All we can do is mourn our losses, and appreciate, with all of our hearts, the soldiers that made it back home. And, in a way, this film brings people together. Don't watch this with elderly family members otherwise you'll embrace a several sad, and soppy moments.The acting is brilliant. Watching soldiers cry is extremely disturbing in my opinion. They fight against their will to survive in order to complete their mission and fulfil a strategy. And when you are told to duck, you DO duck! Fantastic movie. If you liked Band Of Brothers and felt Thin Red Line could of been better, you'll faint by the effort poured into this excellent film.Pocket yourself with cash and Rent it now.</fullReview>

Sorry, I keep babbling. This has to be 10 lines long. Have you seen Gone in 60 Seconds. That movie is awesome. And have you seen him on Friends as Frank Jr. He's really air-headed, but so adorable. But this is definitely the hottest I've seen him. So, bottom line is, he's really hot. Especially in Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 10 Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone says about classic movies, and I'm all for the classics, but this movie is definitely in the top 10 of all time. Seeing this movie in the theater was absolutely hypnotic. I felt as though I was going through everything the characters in the movie went through, and when I was walking home, I distinctly remember feeling a sense of what is probably "Shell Shock." I remember thinking, "What's the point to everything?" which is something people often struggle through after going to war. This work is more than a movie, its an experience. Sadly its not possible to get quite such an intense feeling when watching it at home unless you have a terrific home theater. The giant screen I saw this movie on added to the incredible effect of the movie which fully enveloped me in the world of the story.The opening scene is one of the best scenes ever put to film. If you don't already know what the scene is about, or even if you do, and you have not seen this movie, go out and rent it right now. Turn out all the lights and make sure you are absolutely comfortable and ready to give the movie your full attention. The opening scene is one you will never forget. It felt like I was right there next to 'em.</fullReview>

How can any of you think that the German soldier Upham shoots at the end of the movie isn't the same one he convinced Cpt. Miller to let go earlier? Aside from looking EXACTLY like him (and don't reply some crap about that being just a coincidence and that's what all Germans look like) he says Upham's name when he is pleading for his life. How would the soldier know Upham's name (and don't reply "he read it on his uniform" just to try to make a point just because a smart ass idea popped into your head and you are more than willing to start a fight over the internet. You fat attention seeking nerd) * The German obviously said Upham's name in a desperate attempt to get Upham to let him go again. Aside from that, all of a sudden for no reason Upham grows balls and decides to kill this one German and let all the rest go? He shot him because he recognized him as the same German from earlier, and that's what allowed Upham the nads to finally shoot someone.* Yes I know that I'm being redundant by calling those who seek to pick fights over the internet fat nerds, please no replies telling me this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As i started watching this movie i was grabbed by the battle on Omaha beach because of Speilbergs vision of the scenario. As always Spielberg will get you excited with his movie and not let go, he will add in wonderful visuals and just simply amaze you with his realistic perspective.Within the first scene i thought i wouldn't see another gun battle that great in my whole life, but likely enough there was an even better one at the end of the movie when they find Privat Ryan(Damon) and he says he wont leave his men behind. After Ryan tells them he is not going Hanks has to prepare for another battle, probably the most exciting and intense one ever.One thing you have to take into perspective is that John Williams(composer of film) was one of the people who made this movie intense with his wonderful score to keep you intrigued throughout. I was happy for Spielberg when he one Best Director for the second time(previous for Schindlers List) but i thought this should have won Best Picture and Best Actor for Hanks. If you have not already seen this movie i suggest you see it asap because it is absolutely amazing. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but American rubbish..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the "glorious, morally superior American armed forces", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all "good guys". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the communist threat and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the "Red Hunt", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful film, but not quite perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSWhen that legendary British statesman, Winston Churchill, stated "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few", he was of course referring to the Battle Of Britain. Skipping forward through the war and eventually the allies would succeed in that momentous occasion of D-Day. Landing on the beaches of Normandy, the British, American and other Allied forces would eventually free Europe from the tyranny of the fascists. War has never been simple however, and once in a while, a form of publicity mission might take place. An incident where, during all the blood loss, soldiers would take risks to save one man, just so his mother doesn't loose all of her children. It's always been a strange American military policy in the eyes of many, but as "Saving Private Ryan" shows, there are times it happens.In Spielberg's epic war film, Tom Hanks plays Captain John Miller. Former school teacher and now war veteran, Miller survives the D-Day Landings, only to be ordered to go and retrieve a Private John. F. Ryan (Matt Damon). Ryan's three elder brothers have all died in the last week and the army, aware of this wants the remaining brother to return home. Against Miller's better judgement he travels with about nine men, to find Ryan and return him safely to his mother."Saving Private Ryan" rightly earned Steven Spielberg his second directing Oscar and arguably should have won more. This film is a powerful piece which is at times moving, at times strenuous and always going to keep you glued to the screen. With an enormous cast of well known actors (some which you'll know the names of and some you'll recognise the faces), the film is never short of someone who can deliver a line. It's not these lines which really hit home as much though as the most crucial and most powerful scene in this entire movie is the opening thirty minutes during the Landings themselves. There's no way someone who was born forty years after the end of the war is going to be able to tell you how realistic this film was, but if the events were anything like the film depicted, then the younger generations should be immensely grateful to have never had to taken part in anything similar.Perhaps the one problem with "Saving Private Ryan" is an element of bias. There's always someone around Britain who claims the rest of the Allies could have won the war without America, just like there's Americans who claim they did the majority of the victory and are owed everyone else's eternal gratitude. The truth of the matter is that neither person is right. If America had never got involved then it is likely that just like the rest of Europe, Britain would have fallen to Germany. Ultimately however, with American help, the British still played a massive part in the War and earned praise as much as any country. The problem is that this film seems to ignore this fact. If Tom Hank's soldiers had travelled around the French countryside and met mostly Americans but also a few British, there would have been less problems. The flaw is that this film appears at times to imply that the entire second world war involved purely the Americans, the French and the Germans. There is not a single British person in sight in this entire film. Churchill would not have approved and countless other Brits don't either.This lack of British involvement has perhaps slightly hampered "Saving Private Ryan" at times, but this is a mistake. Whether this film is extremely over patriotic or not (beginning and ending with the American flag for example), that does not take away from it as a beautiful piece of cinema. With amazing cinematography, excellent acting and sturdy directing, "Saving Private Ryan" is understandably in the top ten war films of all time. If perhaps a child is ever to act ungrateful about the age in which we now live in, his or her parents should show them "Saving Private Ryan" to shut them up. Life was hell for so many people during the War, and it feels that perhaps sometimes we forget that. This film will be talked about for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good opening, goes downhill from that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the movie starts off with a credible depiction of D-Day, not shying away from the insane violence and carnage. very shocking and puts you right in the middle of WW2 combat. Unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there. The production quality is still on a high-level,but the story itself isn`t. Spielberg is too fond of his hollywood-type heroism, and spices his otherwise gritty tale with unecessary blandness. The worst part is the display of the german troops. They are displayed as mindless thugs and not as humans. Even much older movies like "Battle for Arnheim", portray germans in a more acceptable way.Enemies like the Japanese,Germans,Vietkong and later on the Russians (former WW2 Allies !) are always shown in US-Warmovies as pure Cannonfodder for the Americans.Back to "Ryan". Spielberg has a fixed mindset about germans, probably heavily influenced by the comic-book nazis of his own "Raiders of the Lost Ark". (which is a good and entertaining movie btw.) He doesn`t trust his story and thinks he has to pump it up with some patriotic music and "heroic" dialogue.Just terrible. I was very dissapointed. Why is it not possible to make a movie at least trying to show both sides, from a soldiers perspective ?ah well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down the best war movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only the best war movie but probably the most realistic movie where man confronts death. I have seen every movie on the subject of violence, gore, war etc. and though this is not a gore fest just for the sake of showing blood, the blood and gut aspect rates up with any for realism. Such as it is war is bloody and this shows it.Let me make one thing clear. This does not mean the movie isn't top notch every where else. In fact that's the reason the bloody fighting is so real because the acting and directing brings it to life. Spielberg has to be totally commended as I can't think of one director aside of maybe Ron Howard who could have brought the realism to film that this winner does.Tom Hanks is absolutely outstanding. It is in his 3 top best and may be his finest. That's up for others to decide. Never the less he is superb. But he is not the only one. Tom Sizemore who I think never gets enough credit is fantastic as well as is Ed Burns. In fact I have to rate this as the best supporting cast in any movie I have ever seen. They are that good. They just feed off each other and it shows in every scene.Speaking of scenes there are literally dozens of outstanding ones in this but the one that really got me was when Jeremy Davies who plays CPL Upham (He played his character so good I wanted to strangle him for his cowardice) can't muster the courage to go up the stairs and help Adam Goldberg who played Pvt. Mellish (another outstanding acting job) in his fight with the German Soldier. I actually was holding my breath when the German was slowly plunging the knife into Mellish's chest and whispering to him to "shh shh shh" thus killing him.Without doubt a movie for all time. As far as realism and just plain great acting, direction production sets etc, etc, etc, this is as good as any there has ever been made. I rate it 5 out of 5...no make that 6 out of 5. Awesome is the only way I can describe it. I have watched it at least 5 times and never get bored.</fullReview>

This short section of the film, with its cinema verite like hand held camera and grainy, newsreel-esque cinematography, is evidence of the calibre (no pun intended) of filmmaker that Spielberg could be.The rest of the film (God knows how long it is) seems to be Spielberg's valiant attempt to ruin the effect of the first sequence. Mothers cry, villains are smoten, good guys manage to fit in a final, heartfelt sentence or two before they croak and Tom Hanks manages to keep the same deadpan, "this-is-the-demure-face-I-get-paid-$20million-a-movie-for" expression on his face throughout the whole film. And as if to rub salt in the wound, there is the final, disgracefully jingoistic image of the film (you know the one I'm talking about).I wouldn't be so outraged at this pro- American big-budget moneymaker if it didn't pretend to be an anti-war masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another movie in the long list of overrated movies here in IMDB. You know, war has always been a favorite subject for movies, because it generates intense emotions. These emotions are there de facto: Just imagine a seriously wounded soldier, screaming, covered in blood, surrounded by fellow soldiers with pain on their faces. You see, it can't be too difficult to generate emotions when the subject is war. And so does this movie, but not in any particularly original way. The most serious problem of this movie is its storyline, which you know from start to end if you read the following sentence: "A soldier has lost his 3 brothers in the war, and so we must find him and save him to soothe his poor mother". That's all folks. The rest is the typical adventures you would expect from a war movie. The same predictable results, the occasional conflict between members of the rescue team, and so on. We have seen all of this, and much better. The only reason this movie will get a 6 out of 10, is the very good (as usual) Tom Hanks. All in all, a great movie to see if you want to forget it in the next 10 minutes after "The End".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best war films ever made, Saving Private Ryan is raw and shocking. Not only because of the gore scenes, but also because of the camera-work. Using a steadycam, combined with the absence of music soundtrack during the breathtaking battle scenes, gives a realistic and natural feel to the film. War films are hardly an opportunity for actors to showcase their talent, as more focus is set on the viewer's visual pleasure, but in this film time is taken to describe many of the characters.Generally Saving Private Ryan is almost excellent and highly recommended.My only objections are as regards the choice of Hanks for the main role (a role more suitable to Clooney or Crowe, if you ask me), and Damon's teeth; it's remarkable that a soldier that's been through hell for a long period of time could easily be the protagonist in a toothpaste ad. :o)9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very much so does this movie have high expectations. yes it was expected to be decent. At first I couldn't figure what was so important about saving private ryan. I guess there was a purpose. The narraration always stuck to the movie. And the plot was right on target. I thought the best part was the beginning when the men struggled to get on the shore. You know my dad was in a war and he went through harsh times but I'm sure it was never that risky. One thing I know this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly Spielberg's greatest film, combining action with the gruesome terror f the second world war. The superb realism makes it feel as if you were actually there when the allies stormed the beaches of Normandy, a bit too much so. I don't think anyone will argue this is a true masterpiece, and while enjoying the film you might actually be learning something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts and ends with shots of the American flag which points to one of its biggest problems. It purports to be an anti war film but this rubbish. While it may show the horrors of war in graphic detail, it ultimately is a celebration of militarism and heroism. Sure, heroism doesn't mean it's a pro-war movie but this movie goes beyond that. It's little surprise that the military are among the biggest fans of this movie. It may not celebrate war as a something good, but then, I can't think of any film that does outside of propaganda movies. If you want an anti war movie that shows heroism and mateship without celebrating the military, watch "All Quiet on the Western Front".It does follow the standard American war movie characterisation rather faithfully. The Germans are universally evil, other nations are either non-existent, villains or locals who get saved by the Americans. Well in this case it is not that far from the truth, without the Americans the war would have gone on much longer than it did and the Germans were villains. But all these facts are distorted and stereotyped in a bad way here. For example, the only German with a sizeable speaking role turns out to be a total coward and backstabber who repays the Americans who saved his life by shooting them. There are a couple of good points to the movie though. It does deviate somewhat from the standard US heroic movies in that it shows that Americans committed war crimes too, like shooting soldiers who had already surrendered. There are also some quite powerful scenes that are as good as any Spielberg has done. Best among them is the scene where a father in a French village tries to pass his daughter to one of the soldiers to save her. This single scene can probably verify this movie's claim to show the horrors of war somewhat. The landing in the Normandy is good, although somewhat overrated. I wasn't there so I can't comment on the realism but it felt like this was close to what it was really like. Many people were upset that the movie only shows Americans fighting the Germans, but for once, this is not really a valid argument since the various armies fought in different areas and would have had very little contact amongst each other. The movie really goes downhill towards the end though when the troop actually find Ryan. Instead of being glad to be out of this hell, he wants to stay there to help out his comrades. Very anti war indeed. This is where the movie turns totally Hollywood and looses all claim it may have had to a somewhat realistic portrayal. A number of people had died already in trying to find Ryan and his decision to stay there costs another couple of people their lifes yet the movie makes him a total hero for it. Steven Spielberg is capable of making great movies, this isn't one of them.The acting is not particularly good and leaves out no cliches. Tom Hanks was actually nominated for an Academy Award for a role that Pee Wee Herman could have played better.Finally, the salutation scene in the end is totally stomach churning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies...ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Not known to many viewers: this is based on events that occured during WWII. Try to find "Into the Breach" for more info.**To say that "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the best war films ever made is an understatement. It might possibly be THE best war film ever made; right up there with other films like "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," "The Deer Hunter," and "Full Metal Jacket." (Yes, I noticed that I used only Nam films, but hey, they're some of the best around!) And for today's Top 250 poll, it's at #27. Even that is an understatement. I believe that SPR should be in the Top 10, maybe even Top 5 best movies of all time. That's all my opinion. But here's a plot summary for this masterpiece.James Ryan (Matt Damon) has lost his brothers in combat. All three of them. So, the government sends Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) with a team of an additional seven to find him and "get him the hell outta there." These people are as diversified as the New Yorker Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) to the Southern sniper Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper;) the timid translator, Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies) to the hardened veteran Sargent Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore.) Along the way they encounter various goose chases and German troops, and suffer losses that affect thoughts of how important one Private is.Every actor in this film is up to his element. I say "his" because, well, to be honest, there are no women in this film, except for random typists and Mrs. Ryan, who don't have speaking parts. Also starring Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Ted Danson.You have not truly lived until you have seen Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Saving Private Ryan on Sunday. Although it's very gory, intense scenes are pivotal to project the realistic view of war, Saving Private Ryan is quite disturbing, yet very good. To all of those with light hearts, I don't recommend this film. Saving Private Ryan is set in WWII, where Tom Hanks and his troops go looking for Private James Francis Ryan, a soldier whose three brothers have already been killed in action. The story is great, the acting even better! I've never seen another war movie as good! To those tough enough, I recommend Saving Private Ryan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had it all.On the positive side, the most outstanding feature was the sound and the camera work. We have often seen battle scenes that would depict the bravery, the madness, the brutality of war. But never before were we so much "included" in the experience, and I attribute it to the amazing way the sounds were worked in, and the ever moving camera work: nothing stands still in such fierce battles. It was so gripping and so effective that I felt sort of trapped, like the soldiers would, like I was in an amusement park's ride that made me dizzy, but I could not get out of. And yeah, the whole opening Omaha beach scene made me a little dizzy.On the negative side, I wish Spielberg (or the story editors) would have taken out the returning German soldier (Steamboat Willie). This is the weakest (IMO) point of the movie. It taints an otherwise very credible story, and I'm disapointed that such a Hollywoodish turn found its way in the script.All in all, a very very good movie, albeit of a very very sad and disturbing subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg isn't good at art, he's a showman who makes must see movies that put things on the screen we haven't seen before. He has terrible taste sometimes, such as Hanks shooting at the tank on the bridge which reminds us of 'Jaws' which wakes us up to the fact that it's only a movie.I watch it for the middle and end which are thrilling, although that may not have been the emotion intended, but that's Barnum for you. The middle section is more traditional and recalls the morality scene in 'Guns Of Navarone' where they have to execute the informer. It works there but is incongruous here, because of the verite style of the war sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid war movie, but highly overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know: RYAN is supposed to be Spielberg's second SCHINDLER. But seriously: If you think about it, it's obviously not! Alright: The Omaha Beach scenes are really some of the most astonishing action sequences ever staged. However, the following story unfolds as a cliché-ed plot like any war story. It reminded me even of the pilot to TOUR OF DUTY. Tom Hanks leads a small platoon through enemy lines to save the last of four brothers, three were already killed in action. On this mission, some of the G.I.s get killed. The rest start pondering if this trip - if the war - is worthwhile. So far so good. To show that this movie is a deep one, Spielberg pulls the joker of showing the enemy in a humane way: "Steamboat Willy", a German officer doomed to get shot, who turns out to be just another nice guy, but from the wrong side. They let him get away. But when they encounter him the second time, the G.I. translator - who never before has killed anybody - has of course to shoot him, just to show that all Germans were demons after all. Hypocrisy! And all the discussions whether the effort was worth it are silenced, when Ryan turns out to be the bestest American boy ever! It could've been a far better film if Ryan was a) dead already, b) a cowardish and unlikable character, c) black, or d) just not to be found. THEN all the thoughts about the reason of war would have led somewhere. Now they are just a fig leaf to cover up a standard B-wartime flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off in blazing hell, 15 minutes of stahlgewitter, men screaming, scattered and dying in a visual assault of maimed bodies and detached limbs. Without a doubt one of the most shocking and memorable depictions of war ever shot. Unfortunately the movie takes a big dip from that point on. Instead of showing us the absurdities of war, something the plot could well have brought across, Spielberg laborously evolves the movie around trusted values like male comradeship, loyalty and heroic patriotism, blasting the genre of the american war movie 30 years into the past. Combined with the effort of Hollywood's most pretentious actor, Tom Hanks, and a criminally tacky score makes this one of the most pathetic war movies ever made.Terrence Malik's "Thin Red Line", which it incidently sunk at the box offices, shows what this movie could - should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a terrible Steven Spielberg film! Usually Spielberg's films are very intelligent and demanding masterpieces but SAVING PRIVATE RYAN wasn't more than a gory bloody massacre! The Germans were again the pieces of scum, not worth to live. Films like STALINGRAD, DAS BOOT or PLATOON show us, that there are ALWAYS innocents and unscrupulous killers on BOTH sides! In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN the german soldiers are just the meat stock of the WW2. American soldiers are dying always a gruesome painful death, so the audience can really start to hate the Germans and hope for more scenes in which more Nazis get killed. The german soldiers were usual soldiers too, and especially in the last months of the war they didn't want to carry on fighting, but there was not a single sign that the Germans were humans too in the movie, they were just cannon fodder. For example: There was the standoff between the Americans and the Germans in the destroyed city. Every German got killed the Americans survived without any problems. It's painful enough that such senseless movies are still so popular in this time but the fact that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a Steven Spielberg film (hey, the man made movies like E.T. Schindler's List and Jurassic Park) is truly shocking! I think the movie was so much glorified because it was a Spielberg! If S.P.R. would be a war movie by a no-name-director it wouldn't be more than a second MISSING IN ACTION. (Please mail me your opinion)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great tense stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film to bits. Spielberg, Williams and Kaminski strike again with this great WWII front line drama. All actors were excellent in their roles, and I think Hanks was stiffed at the Oscars. I especially liked the beginning of the D-Day landing scene, with Hanks and co. in the transporter. At that point you can really feel the tension building up, mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach. The suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter, and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets. The point is, Spielberg makes the audience feel like they're one of the soldiers on the transporter, and I was no exception. I got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there. The length of the landing scene was quite long, getting you into the feel of the time scale. The blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was. The thing is, that's what it was really like.Granted, it does get a bit slow when they start looking for Ryan, but not to the point where you're bored enough to want out of the cinema. The bonding between the soldiers in the squad is also highlighted in the film, Corporal Upham for example, being excluded by the others at the start, and by the end is joining in with the lingo (i.e., 'foobar'). The ending tugged on the heart strings plenty, and it shows that Hanks' character was no hero, but a normal human being, hesitating to put his life on the line for another (cf. 'earn this'). The overall effect of this film is pure anti-war.John Williams' score was excellent as usual, and the fact that there was no music in the battle scenes was a good move, so that the audience can concentrate on the action. Kaminski's shots were just genius, his freehand style instantly recognisable, giving a real feeling of terrifying action and movement at the start and end of the film. This film was stiffed at the Oscars. Mark my words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it a vote as high as 3 merely because I believe that on technical merits alone, it was quite good. However, as far as its entertainment value, it had none whatsoever for me. I found that I could not see past the violence and gore... It therefore, as far as I was concerned, had no plot, no character development, no nothing. Many will disagree with those statements, but note that it's not that the script was without those things, or even that the actors necessarily did a bad job, but simply that the violence was just too strongly present.I remember hearing that the director wanted this to be a movie that would "show how war really was". Well, I've never been in a war, nor do I have any desire to fight. If this movie gave me the feeling of being in a war, than if I am ever in one, I will become a mindless drone. I will be almost completely without emotion, my biggest feeling will be one of disgust. I do not feel, though, that this movie has made me feel any differently about war... I still think it's a horrible thing. The movies that have made me feel more strongly in that direction are those that have drawn me in to the characters lives, and then ripped those lives apart. Just a few such examples are Platoon and Schindler's List on the serious side, and just as potently Good Morning Vietnam and Life is Beautiful on the comedy side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most gut-wrenching war movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen lot's of war movies in my 32 years of life, but this one is by far the only one that really, really affected me emotionally. Watching this movie in the theatre, I had knots in my stomach. The emotional impact of the film is something I had never experienced in such intensity. The visuals were absolutely the best, music (while sometimes too melodramatic) was first rate, and the acting was mostly excellent. I will admit that the movie did drag somewhat in the middle stages, but I'm glad it did because I needed the break!Many people here have said that this movie was not an anti-war movie. Far from the truth. Spielberg has shown what war REALLY IS form a soldiers point of view (witrh some creative liberties thrown in to be sure). He shows us war for what it is...bloody, ugly, violent in the extreme, and most of the time has us wondering "why?" If anyone wants to rush off to war after seeing this film, you have some issues to deal with. And is there something wrong with Spielberg showing soldiers as "heroes?" I didn't see that very much anyway, especially at the beginning...I saw "good-guy" soldiers shooting surrendered Germans..not very heroic, but most likely true. In my opinion, EVERY single person of that generation that went "over there" was a hero, ugly consequences aside.And to the European crowd who cry about how ther were other nationalities that sacrificed and bled just as much as the "noble Americans" did...we know that. Thats why they called it WORLD war 2. This movie, however, focused on Omaha beach...the most heavily defended beach of D-Day. Americans were there and they were slaughtered by the hundreds. The Brits were over on another beach (Gold) with very little resistance, not the kind that the Americans experienced at Omaha in comparison. This is not to take away the valiant sacrifices of your boys, but to put this mud-slinging in context here. If you want a movie made about your sacrifices specifically, then make one. But don't take away the fact that it was predominatly AMERICANS who bled and bled hard at Omaha. The U.S. flag waving at the beginning and end? Whats the big deal? Ryan was an American soldier in the 101st airborne...what the heck ELSE was Spielgberg supposed to show?? The Union Jack??At any rate, this movie should be ranked as one of the greatest war movies of this century. If you haven't seen it, you should. World War 2 is not all old black-and-white combat footage you see in documentaries. It's sacrifice, death, struggling, and heroics and rolled into one and chances are there is someone in your family who was over there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, Hollywood! Wherefore art thy head, Hollywood? Could it be up thy ass?The American public are suckers for movies with cool special effects and bitchin surround sound. We love Saving Private Ryan for the same reason we love the Fourth of July. When I first saw the movie, however, it was blasting from my larger than life 19 inch Sanyo Television set. It was less than spectacular.I have to admit the first few minutes were disturbingly real-looking and the buzz is that they are as close a depiction of the events of D-Day as we may ever realize on film. For that, I give the film the weight of my praise. Without it, I would have voted 2 instead of a 4. However, once the nightmarish slaughter was over and the film attempted to transform itself from megabudgeted explosion rally into something resembling a watchable war epic it flounders and flails, pathetically begging to be recognized."Look, we've got Tom Hanks and Matt Damon!" it pouts. As if we didn't already know this, the film tries to tell us war is terrible. As the story progresses, it seems to whine about it.[Editors note: possible spoilers ahead]Saving Private Ryan attempts at points to explore the eccentricities of war. Some examples: The guy at the beginning of the movie who is nailed in the head and saved by his helmet takes off the helmet in wonderment and is immediately killed by another shot to the head. The virgin-to-combat interpreter intellectual who begs for the life of the German prisoner citing the "rules of war" is the one who is ultimately responsible for most of their deaths. As a recurring theme, the characters wonder why they sould risk the lives of their squadron to search for a man who is probably dead. To these I say, "Please contrive your metaphors and heavy-handed imagery a little more Mr. Spielberg. Maybe then I wont have to think at ALL during your movies. Maybe you'll attain a level of patronizing that will remove the need for audiences to realize their own feelings. Perhaps have someone stand at the front of the theatre with cue cards displaying the emotion you want the audience to experience in each scene. The problem with taking Speilberg seriously about anything is of course his sticky-sweeet sentimentality. Think E.T. Think Cocoon. Think the old folks home skit in Twilight Zone: The Movie. The only place it has worked well is Schindler's List when, taking a moment outside himself, Spielberg created a powerful and moving drama. I think this is largely due to Liam Neeson's solid performance. I guarantee anyone with a developed sense of irony and individuality will after seeing this movie on the small screen take their accolades down a notch and stop praising Speilberg for being someone he isn't: Frank Capra.</fullReview>

But 20 minutes later, I realized that I was basing my opinion on the spectacular opening act, which really presented a realistic view of a large scale offensive.But that's about all the movie has going for it. The first act leaves the audience stunned, and Spielberg uses the diversion to traipse through the rest of the movie with nary a thought of actually doing anything remotely original or interesting.

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks(big) heads a great cast in a voyage that takes the audience back to a time of despair. The whole cast give superb performances-Tom Sizemore(heat),Ed Burns(she's the one)Matt Damon(good will hunting)and jeremy davies(twister) are tremendous in a tear jerking film that breaks the hardest of hearts. This film will be remembered for the opening battle on Omagh Beach in which we were slaughtered terribly. However, I can't help thinking that the rental experience would be quite as good as the surround sound cinema. Still, it is a great film with superb performances. Rating=5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best war movies of all time!!! The first 15 minutes are very shocking and there is a lot of blood but it's one of the best part of it. The directing was excellent;Spielberg couldn't do better;especially at the 15 first minutes. The story is quite good and shows you all the misery of the second world war. The actor were fantastic;especially Tom Hanks and Matt Damon.After watching this movie you will feel very lucky if you didn't go war one day.Watch it it's a beautifull movie!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a very deep and personal meaning for me. My dad was a WWII combat veteran. After seeing this film, I looked at my dad's army photo and metals hanging on our living room wall and I thanked my dad for fighting for our freedom then I cried my eyes out.This is the best and most realistic war film I have ever seen (ranking above PLATOON and GLORY.) Stephen Spielberg really deserved his best director Oscar, because of the great camera angles during the intense Omaha Beach scene. Terrific performances all around.Thank you, Mr. Spielberg for a powerful film that makes us feel even more thankful for the veterans on this Memorial Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes (at Omaha beach) is absolutely a knock-out! Incredible realistic scenes! Masterpiece direction by Spielberg! But the rest of the movie is just like any Spielberg film : old stuff with a new feeling. We saw that kind of story a thousand times: Attack (1956) Red Badge of courage (1951) Walk in the sun (1946) All quiet on the western front (1930) There's also a 1919 Universal war movie, Heart of humanity, telling the story of a mother who lost all his sons in World War I, except one... But the Omaha Beach is absolutely amazing! The rest is just Hollywood entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare in Love doesn't even begin to compare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was physically sickened when I witnessed the outcome of the Oscars this evening. When Steven Spielberg won Best Director honors, I was immensely pleased. I thought that Saving Private Ryan, the best film of 1998, and the best war film ever would surely take Best Picture honors. However, when Harrison Ford announced that Shakespeare in Love was Best Picture, I was on the verge of vomiting. While Shakespeare in Love may have been a decent film, it was resoundingly light, fluffy fare that didn't deserve to win Best Actress (that should have gone to Cate Blanchett), nor Best Picture.Now that I've put Shakespeare in Love down enough (not entirely enough, but as much as possible right now), I want to write about the virtues of Saving Private Ryan. When I first saw this movie, I was amazed at every single element. Nothing was flawed in this film. The sound was amazing, as was the cinematography, the editing, the screenplay, the incredibly subdued performance of Tom Hanks, and the tremendous supporting cast. With the bookends of the two extraordinary battles, and the framing sequences that mean say so very much about the meaning and loss in war with so few words, Saving Private Ryan was obviously both the best film of 1998, and the best film about war ever filmed. Because of this, it will be remembered long after Shakespeare in Love goes the way of Tom Jones, The Life of Emile Zola, and all of those other forgettable Best Pictures that have come before. Steven Spielberg did a great service to WWII veterans, and the movie-going public with this film, and I hope that it's remembered for much longer than the light, meaningless Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Lots to say.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be going against the grain here, but, if you haven't seen it yet then let me give you some advice.... don't!It is a really well made movie, the storyline, the actors, the effects, the music, all are excellent... the highest quality... if this movie doesn't win a clutch of Oscars then there is something seriously wrong with Hollywood.So after all of this why would I recommend NOT going to see it? Because I think that this movie is the most psychologically disturbing and shocking movie I have ever seen in my life on this planet. I read the revues about the realism of the war scenes and thought what the hell it can't be any worse than "Platoon" or "Full Metal Jacket", I'll give it a try... bad lapse of judgement.The movie is three hours long, and after maybe the first ten minutes I wanted to leave... but the thought was that sooner or later this assault on the senses must let-up... you wait and you wait and you wait, and it doesn't! The realism, the emotions, the atmosphere of war, are all there for the three full hours. Even in the quiet, I can't use the word peaceful, moments of the movie there are still the oppressive feelings of the expectation that this certainly can not last... and it doesn't. These moments are played to the best effects of the greatest suspense movies.My friend and I left the cinema after the final credits, we couldn't say anything....I don't know whether to think of Mr. Spielberg as the greatest movie maker on the face of this planet... or the most irresponsible manufacturer of shock horror movies ever... but this is really not the correct way to put it because, shocking it was without a shadow of a doubt, but, horror it most definitely was not... If you watched all of the news, or documentaries, that were ever made about the scenes and effects of war it would not be one percent of the preparation required to watch this movie.Anyone who sees this movie can not fail to be affected by it... consequently I tend to ere on the side of Mr Spielberg being a little irresponsible. War is a fact of human life, we can never escape some peoples urge to kill each other... but why show it so graphically on the large screen? At some point in the future, although I hope it never happens, some of our offspring will have to go-out and fight a war for us... why do we have to be shown what they will face?As you can see... I was just a tad affected by this film. But what can I say, Mr Spielberg has outdone Mr Cameron yet again... although my feeling is that this movie will not get the recognition of "Titanic" for three reasons: there is no love story, there is no Di-caprio or Winslet... and America does not come out of this movie with the flag of rationality and reason flying high... more like at half mast with no breeze...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that the one thing that characterised this show more than anything else for myself was the total lack of sensationalism in the movie. So little of the show seemed contrived, but it just simply feels like the way it was like. Too many movies today appear to demonstrate violence and carnage for its sake, but they invariably never made me feel for it the way that SPR did.Some comments indicate that SPR is nationalistic. For me, it wasn't, and I'm an Asian. After watching the show, I felt saddened for the sheer numbers of lives wasted, and the hundreds of thousands of young soldiers- of ALL nationalities, not just Americans- for their tremendous sacrifice in the carnage. The leaders of the antagonistic nations be dammed, but it was the common soldier who had to die senselessly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a surgeon that treats wounded soldiers, I was shocked to see the concealed parts of my professional life totally exposed to the unsuspecting individual. This movie is indeed a landmark that exposes the true side of the "romantic" wars that have been part of our cultural upbringing for decades, shattering the notion that war is an exciting adventure. It is not ! Soldiers are usually 18-20 year old boys, that get ripped apart by metal objects that kill, maim and cause terrible pain and anguish to their families. Even though this movie had it's Hollywood side, it succeeded in conveying the true nature of warfare - killing in every conceivable way. The ghastly scenes of spilled guts, and blown off limbs are accurate to a point that brings back vivid memories to those that treat wounded soldiers. I sincerely hope that this very explicit movie will cause people to understand the true horrors of war. As Marlon Brando uttered in Apocalypse now: "The horror, the horror".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War II Never Looked So Visceral.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan", is one of the most pivotal moments in both Steven Spielberg's career, and the War genre in motion picture history.It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.Most notably to be said about the movie, is the depiction of the Omaha landings. Basically, it was a war re-enactment consisting of 1500 extras and 30 or so amputees. Spielberg did not plan ahead in terms of storyboarding, but instead decided to place the camera where it was best suited for spontaneous reactions. Admist all the amazing locations and bombed out villages, every soldier is relying on one solid emotion to get through the war, hope, which comes in the form of the missing Private Ryan. Unfortunately, that hope is tested as inevitable casualties will demoralise and divide the squadron.This film covers pretty much all aspects of war. The tension, nature and sadness of it all gets stripped bare, as all stones are turned and the end result is one of poetic beauty. However, I never really found myself caring whether they found Ryan or not. Though the ending can't help but feel forced, it's certainly touching and has a lot of patriotism in mind.Final Verdict: Definitely one of Spielberg's finest. I look forward to watching "Band of Brothers" (2001), and seeing what this man can do with more running time. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg was the only director's name I knew for a long portion of my life.Mainly because I was a narcissistic young lad and due to his first name, I presumed he must be brilliant.But he spells it incorrectly.'Stephen' is spelled with a 'ph' not a 'v'.Anybody worth their salt knows that.Saving Private Ryan is a lot like it's director's first name - it's a near perfect film.The only blemish on this entire movie is the opening and ending ten minutes, the two scenes featuring the old man revisiting the tombstones at Normandy. They are totally unnecessary to the plot of the film and hokey as all get out.Otherwise all of the narrative which takes place during World War II is sensational.Sure the scene where they storm the beaches on D-Day is a marvelous sight to behold, but don't let that detract from the scenes that follow. It's all good stuff.Tom Hanks leads a cast of fantastic characters including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Brian Cranston and Paul Giamatti.All deliver exceptional performances throughout.If you've been keeping SPR in the back pocket like me, let it out anytime.You'll enjoy this film.But stop reading here, I'm going to spoil a few things.Vin Diesel is very good in this movie, and it gets a little dusty when his character dies, but it seems like there is some ADR (additional dialogue recording) shoved into the scene directly preceding.The only portion of the movie that may ruin the suspension of disbelief is here, when Vin takes the daughter. The scene is a bit unbelievable, it only lasts a second, but something is lost to the viewer. I think the ADR might be part of the reason.Speaking of, when he's laying there and takes out the note for his father, I'm almost certain there is ADR because his lines do not match up with his lips or body language.Anyway, if I were to criticize that scene, I'd be nitpicking. It still gets dusty no matter what he's saying.To address my earlier criticism, you might argue that the 'bookends' (the scenes in which we see Matt Damon all grown up, having fathered at least two generations) are necessary to provide redemption to the deceased characters.This is a fair point, but I don't think we need this kind of handholding. I don't believe anyone would have wondered whether or not he went on to father children. Almost all of the characters are heroic (especially Private Ryan) and we know that he's alive at the end of their mission.They are required to give him another chance, and that's made apparent by his survival during the film's climax. The viewer can presume he will make the best of the life they've sacrificed for.But this is all semantics. Leave the scenes in, for all I care.Saving Private Ryan is a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a great film. The film's second scene, which is based on Omaha Beach on D-Day really makes the whole film 10/10, as if it wasn't for that scene, I would have probably given it an 8/10. This is because of the action in the scene, as Steven Spielberg shows a good example of what happened to the soldiers that day, and what a struggle it was. Other than the D-Day scene, the film is still amazing, as it provides lots of drama, such as the scene with the tense sniper game, and the parents daughter being taken. Also the part in the destroyed town, which is a big part of the story. Altogether Saving Private Ryan is a spectacular film, and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects! Bad Acting. Scenes of Exaggerated Carnage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is awash with wildly exaggerated scenes of carnage. Seems like every member of the GRRREATEST Generation wants to be remembered for the kind of over-the-top violence that has graced Vietnam War films. "Oh yeah, that's just how it was!" Right. Looks like Omaha Beach lost every other guy. Nope. One in ten.We have pictures of the Normandy Landing. Look at them. Does the beach look anything like Spielberg's beach? Spielberg's beach looks like a video game. Bullets streaking through the water and killing the soldiers as they swim up from the bottom of sea. This is how history gets rewritten.Suppose there was one landing boat that landed right in front of a pill box (good thinking) and got hell shot out of it. Why is Spielberg showing that one unfortunate boat? Feel manipulated? Get used to it. This whole soap opera is chock full of Bridges-of-Madison-County drawn- out boring melodramatic scenes designed to pluck at your heart strings.Oliver Stone complains that Spielberg is playing into the "Good War" mantra that is currently being used to finance the War on Terror. I saw no signs of that. I saw US soldiers shooting down unarmed POWs and beating prisoners. A touch of Vietnam to thrill our taste for revenge? Or is it just part of the arms race between chicken-hawk war directors trying to stimulate our jaded tastes?The acting is atrocious. It's hard to blame the actors, really, since we don't get to know them at all. They are simply red-shirts waiting their turn to get shot down or get into hissy fits. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks (as always). There's no tension. We know what's going to happen, we're just waiting for it. And it all unfolds so slowly. It's boring. The scenes that could contain some excitement are spent in a quick and confused blur. It's a mess. There's no more artistry in this movie than is contained in your typical music video. Halftracks and Rangers pop up out of nowhere as our heroes cross an open field. Endless streams of machine gun fire pour out from nowhere in particular. It's just ludicrous.There are few scenes in Saving Private Ryan that aren't replete with unnaturally sentimental dialog, unrealistic dissension in the ranks, haunted stares, tears, and Hollywood's rendition of jaunty, chummy talk. They might as well have been a bunch of teenage girls. One Star, for the CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach, Ranger Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st Airbourne named Private James Ryan. With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.World War I is often considering "The Great War" or "The War to End All Wars," but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad film, but not at all memorable. Of course the beginning and end are mawkish and irritating. The Omaha beach sequence it has to be said is exciting. Now i'll openly admit i'm a bit of an anorak....but some of the scenes during the final battle sequence were laughable. Firstly, considering they were likely part of an experienced Panzer division the Germans were ridiculously naive tactically. In reality they would have made life a lot harder for the Americans until air support arrived. (in the unlikely form of P51s, British Typhoons would have been most likely) The second point i'd like cleared up is the matter of the sniper in the bell tower and his demise. He ls dispatched by what looks to me like a tank destroyer with a long barrel 75mm!? IF the piece could have been elevated that far it would have been firing an AP round which would most likely have passed straight through the tower doing little or NO damage. In reality the Germans would have kept their Panzers and tank destroyers largely static and used them for ambush only???</fullReview>

The worst thing for me, though, by far, was the final scene in the cemetery - this isn't a spoiler because the film has been out for so long now anyway. Ryan's final salute and words of gibberish don't go anywhere near, in my opinion, expressing the depth and profoundity of the experience. It's so sloppy it actually makes you want to vomit and I question here why Spielberg, at the final moment, allows the superficiality of nationalism to take precedence over humanity. It's as if Spielberg is saying Ryan is first and foremost an American before he is a human being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been more than ten years since I convinced my mom to take me to see Saving Private Ryan at the World premiere in '97. I was 16, and the movie had an R rating.Needless to say I had quite a surprise coming my way.Since I was a kid I've always been fond of War history and I have read countless books, seen documentaries and so on. Nothing however, have ever opened my eyes like Saving Private Ryan.In this masterpiece, Spielberg puts you right there on the beach. The excellent photography by Janusz Kaminski (for which he won an Oscar) and amazing sound effects in the breathtaking opening scenes is probably the best sequences in a movie ever. It really makes you feel like you're actually there in person.Where other war movies often glamorizes the soldier, gives war that romantic "Hero" touch, Saving Private Ryan hacks into your mind like no other movie. It is rough, chillingly brutal, and beautiful at the same time. It tries in no way to give you an illusion, it simply tries to give the audience the feeling of how it was like to be there.This is where Saving Private Ryan succeeds.I dare say that no other movie has managed to put a given scenario into such a breathtakingly good movie.As for the acting, Hanks does a fine job as Cpt. Miller. Even Vin Diesel - Mr. Testosterone - pulls of a convincing role as Caparzo. Giovanni Ribisi was for me maybe the biggest surprise of them all; I dare say his acting style was perfect for the role of Wade.All in all, I can't find any war movie better, and hardly any movie at all to compete from any category. As for war movies, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece in itself but not even that comes close to SPR in describing the brutality of war.I used to love the idea of being a soldier. After seeing this movie more than ten years ago I never dreamed of being one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is probably on of the greatest war films ever made, along with Paths of Glory and Appocalypse Now.The way that Spielberg develops the characters throughout the film is very good. My Grand-Father along with many other people who fought in WW2 would say it is very very very realistic. Especially in the opening scene at the beaches and the final battle at the end.Tom hanks is brilliant in it as well as the rest of the cast, It's brilliantly shot and very very well made.It shows what the life was like for a WW2 soldier.And it shows the Absolute Hell of war and what is what like to be there.Many people would say they cried at the end, even men because it is just so moving to think how or why we do this and how could we have done this to each other, and Tom Hank's last words made it even more moving. It has Beautiful music and is a Gem of a film.I would definitely recommend it for 12 years and above, and it should be shown to every child out there to teach them the reality of war.If you haven't seen this already go and buy the DVD now! If there was a higher rating than 10 I would it a 100.Brilliant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe the greatness of this film. Hell, if I type a long review of this film, it might take away the film's credibility. So I'm gonna keep this review short, sweet and simple.ACTING: Superb. Likable characters and they put you, the audience, smack dab in the middle of the war. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Notable mention is Jeremy Davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier, Upham.DIRECTION: Excellent. Frenetic camera movement, thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences. Spielberg is masterful, as always. He manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really is.STORY/SCREENPLAY: Storywise, it is uplifting and inspiring. And during historical moments, it is accurate and realistic. Screenplay slips into sentimental state during times, but we'd look over that.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Mesmerizing. At times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish (there goes that word again) display of a blood-drenched beach and war-torn cities. The color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematography.MUSIC: Is put into places where it should be. John Williams does a fantastic job once again.OVERALL: In short, definitely in my favorite movies list, and on the critical side, one of the greatest movies ever made. This film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers.9.966/10Delton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem amongst the trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first off let me be clear on a few points: I rarely, if ever, write reviews. Second, I am not American, I'm a proud Canadian. I'm not enlisted in our military, nor am I a veteran.Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be, in my opinion, one of the most moving films in the last 40 years. So realistic that Veterans of the War and in particular Operation Overlord (or Operation Atlantic for the Canadians participation on June 6, 1944) have a hard time watching the movie.Now, the events that the 8 soldiers in the movie participate in are an amalgamation of several different events that happened to different people throughout the real war: While Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers Battalion did participate in Overlord, they were at Pointe du Hoc, not Omaha Beach as depicted here. The rescue of Sgt Fredrick Niland was not done by a group of rangers, but rather by a French chaplain. Bridges were a common point of contention and it was not unheard of to see a small group of soldiers defending such an important transportation artery.Saving Private Ryan takes these events and more and weaves them into an incredible story of the courage and honor that has left me stunned time and time again. Unlike so many movie characters these days, I see a depth to these characters. Mellish is a Jew. Miller is a schoolteacher. Jackson is a Christian. And of course the somewhat nerdy Corporal Upham.On the other side we have Steamboat Willie, unfortunately the only German (being German does NOT make him Nazi) soldier we see a whole lot of. It is likely that, like the Americans, he is only following orders, as the Nazi Regime in those days "recruited" as many able bodied soldiers as they could - including POWs, like the Czechs.In addition if you think that the blood and gore is an attempt to provide "entertainment value" to this film, then maybe you need to look up the real WWII. In contrast SPR is much more sterile in that respect than the war really was. War is a bloody, horrible, terrible thing, and SPR comes very close to that reality. Blown off limbs, spilled guts, and blood are unfortunate realities.If your looking for a film to watch for entertainment value, don't bother with this one. If, on the other hand, you want to watch a movie that is a worthy tribute to our Veterans - American, Canadian, British - this one is well worth your while. Start to finish, this film gives me a sense of pride to think of all those people in our military who fight so hard and put their lives on the line just so ordinary people like myself can stay free and live our lives the way we were meant to. My hat's off to those people, with a heartfelt thanks and prayer.One last note, I have heard of this film (and even the real Operation) being paralleled and compared with the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (or MOHAA for short). Let me be crystal clear on this point: It was a good game (I played it) but it was just that - a game. If you die, you can start over until you win. The same was not true for all the people that gave their lives during this bloody campaign. None of them had a health bar of 100 and a start button for another chance at the battle.My hats off to Steven Spielberg and the Cast for such a superb effort!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far More Than Just Another War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece. It is very rare to see a movie and truly be moved by it. From start to finish, you are so immersed in this film that you are feeling every emotion of every character as if you were them. The true underlying message is often hard for most people to pick out, but if you truly grasp what this movie is about, you will realize just how beautiful a movie can be.The audio in this movie and the gritty, unflinching realism grabs you and pulls you into the war that Spielberg has so incredibly painted on the screen. The opening scene of D-Day is perhaps the single most dramatic and immersive movie experience I have ever come across in my entire life.Unlike most films, every death you witness in this film stabs at your conscience. You truly feel the adrenaline of the killer, the pain of the soldier, and the sorrow of the soldier's friends every time someone dies.This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made, even beyond the war genre. Every piece of this masterpiece is a work of art. The terrifying and realistic sound effects, the emotional and beautiful soundtrack, and the flawless performance by the actors makes this movie unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, horrific, magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like "Patton," "The Longest Day," "Midway," and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us will never know what it was like on Omaha Beach June 6, 1944. Saving Private Ryan has without a doubt been the most realistic war films ever made. This is as close as most of us will come to know what it was like that day on the beach. Every character in this movie is perfectly cast. Spielbeg shows us once again that he is one of the best directors of his generation. The way he makes every character in the movie seem like an everyman, is so realistic because after all these guys aren't superheroes. There normal blue collar guys who work for a living. This movie might just be the best war movie ever made, it is right up there with Patton, The Longest Day, and Stalag 17. Even if your not a war buff, watch it for the history. And as we all know "If we do not know history we are doomed to repeat it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually graphic and disturbing war epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a WW2 film that begins on the Normandy beaches of France on D-day, June 6th, 1944. The first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war I have seen. The D-day beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again. The noise, carnage, and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer. Unlike anything I have ever seen.So far through the film you have been following Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) and his company on the beaches of Normandy. After the intense battle the US Army counts its dead. Three brothers were killed on that same day in Normandy. The 4th and youngest brother is James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon), and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown. Private Ryan is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings. He is the last of the sons that his mother still has. The army wants him found and brought back home to safety. Captain Miller is now given this task to find Private Ryan and bring him to safety.Captain Miller now travels across battle torn French country side to find Private Ryan. But he does not travel alone. He travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company. On their journey they face hard struggles. The mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one? The men do finally find Private Ryan but Ryan does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with. So now Captain Miller and his men stay with Ryan and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives. The Germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks. Captain Miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on. What develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands I have ever seen in a war movie.Spielber masterfully directed the battle sequences. The battle scenes attacked your senses. The special effects were mind boggling to say the least. The scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic. So much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer. War is shown as what it is. Nasty!!!!!!!!! The acting was very good all around except from I think Matt Damon. But Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance. The film also stars Tom Sizemoore and Edward Burns as part of the rescue mission. Throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like Paul Giamatti and even Ted Danson. Overall the acting was very good.The dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much. Captain Miller's character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in France. And some of the lines, although not many, were a little cliché.I felt the film to be a little biased towards the Americans which I hate to see in movies. Spielberg seemed to convey the Germans as evil jerks. German soldiers were just like the American soldiers. There is a difference between the German Army and the Nazi SS. So I was ashamed to see the German soldiers representing evil. War should represent evil, not German soldiers. Both sides are committing unforgiving violence. Not just the Germans.Saving Privazte Ryan is a very good film. Everyone should at least experience it once, especially if you are a WW2 buff. Very educational! Not the best movie of all time but still very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut the first and last scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be clear; I like the Normandy beach scene? they're actually quite brilliant. But the first and last scenes are those on the cemetery with the old man and his family. Why are those scenes there? They are totally obsolete. I don't need to hear the old man ask his wife if his life was worth it. If the movie itself didn't make this clear then the movie failed? and the movie didn't fail.I saw the movie "A thin red line" a week earlier, and at first I was disgusted by Saving Private Ryan. It just doesn't have the same weight. But then again, you shouldn't compare these two movies as they are totally different. And when I saw this one a few times at later stages this became clear to me.The story itself is quite simple, and rightfully so. A bunch of soldiers are send to save a last of four brothers. It needs to be simple; it's the little things that make the soldiers so unique. The little stories of Matt Damons, Tom Hanks and other characters make this movie. And the comradery between the men is portrait very good as well. It's not poetic, but men which are fighting (and trying to survive) in an unforgiving war.I don't know, maybe it's just me. I just got a bit of a beef against Steven Spielberg lately. When the plot has been clear he seem to insert several more scenes that explain the plot again and again. He just needs to stop this. It makes the movie unnecessary long and dull. He does this with most of his movies in the last decade. And don't get me wrong, I got nothing against long movies, but the length needs to fit the movie.Just cut the first and last scene and all will be fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You both are dim bulbs to say the least. The film is a fictional story and purports to be just that, why people keep holding it to a documentary standard is beyond me. But it's stupid to do that and displays the limited intellect of those like twistedfieldofvision who do just that.Carmad, you are not a writer. And nobody who works in your ward on the psych wing believes your "I am Shakespeare" proclamations. I'm sure your equally impotent teen pal who thinks he is Napoleon and occupies the bunk above yours believes you, but consider the source on that one.This film is brilliant and is one of the top 3 movies S.S. ever made. The speech where the General reads Lincoln's letter is touching and very appropriate. WW2 was the moral equivalent of the war to free the slaves. Tom Brokaw labels the fighting allied men of WW2 the GREATEST GENERATION. He is correct. And their humility regarding what they did for mankind's future is part of the reason that label is accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen many war movies , in fact War is the genre that interests me the most . However , Saving Private Ryan is a movie that stands apart from all others . As soon as the film starts you know that the movie is something special , there is something different in this movie as compared to others on the same subject . Spielberg not only manages to depict the brutality of war superbly but also manages to blend this with the mission given to 8 American Soldiers . If you're a fan of Warfare and violence then the first half hour of the movie will be enough for you . It is an absolutely sensational and gripping depiction of what these brave men must have gone through . Tom Hanks is brilliant as usual , playing the role of Captain John H. Miller flawlessly . Some of his conversation scenes with the other soldiers are very well projected by Spielberg who again shows how good he is as a Director . All in all this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and certainly the best when it comes to a movie about War .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly the best war movie ever and one of the greatest movies over all of all time. It is incredibly well made. The first 20 minutes of this movie is one of the greatest scenes of all time. It made people realize the pain and what it felt what it was like to be at D Day. It is truly amazing. This movie is very well made. The cinematography. The sound and special effects. The score by John Williams. This is easily Steven Spielberg's best movie ever. He totally deserved to win the Best Director award at the Oscars. It should have totally won best picture over Shakespeare in love. In the end, after the fateful battle at the end, i will not tell what happens, it justs leaves us with one question. Are the lives of eight men worth saving one? Probably not. One of the greatest movies ever. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible to Rate "Saving Private Ryan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long opening D-Day battle scene in "Saving Private Ryan" is a true shocker, and you'd better believe what I say. I almost left the theater the first time I saw it on a big screen; I can just barely stand it on a TV screen. I can't watch "Saving Private Ryan" without bawling, and that's not like me at all. How can I rate the damn thing when I can't even see it through my tears? Tom Hanks as Captain John H. Miller. Matt Damon as Private James Francis Ryan. Ted Danson as Captain Fred Hamill. Jeremy Davies as Corporal Timothy P. Upham. And all the rest of the actors, even Vin Diesel as short-lived Private Adrian Caparzo. Stellar line-up.Listen: Tom Hanks always turns in a great acting performance, even when the film into which he's thrust doesn't give him much of a chance. I don't mean this film; I'm thinking of an inferior screenplay like "Cast Away." Even there, Hanks almost made it great. In "Saving Private Ryan" the screenplay and Hanks are really, truly great.I don't hand out tens easily.Enough said? Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mission is a man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is (in a word) outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours).A brilliant innovation is the colour reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.The storyline is a real strength and the characters &amp; acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad.But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered "brothers" in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, "Steamboat Willie" humanises the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context.Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being interested in history enormously and loving films with an historical background, I was very interested in this one at first. But I really think this film is the very reason, I started to dislike movies about WWII. American productions dealing with this topic always include a lot of bathos, but this one was too much after all and I have no clue how come, so many critics are amazed by it. The description of the events is horribly one-sided and unrealistic that I can only recommend to watch "Das Boot" or "Der Untergang" (downfall) instead to get a realistic impression of what was going on back then.I still voted with three because the performance by Tom Hanks as a soldier suffering from Parkinson was quite good and interesting. I'm thus still waiting for a film showing the events on the American side realistically.</fullReview>

No doubt Tom Hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country. The war scenes are excellent. One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked. Shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because The US has begun other wars in Asia and other sites.

		<shortDescription>A war movie which in fact is poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually watch and give credit to European movies and usually hate the Hollywood production. And I usually see a political statement in "Schindlers list" which is commonly quoted as "his best movie" and "the best movie about holocaust".However... after seeing S.P.R. I must agree that this is, if probably not the "best movie ever made", the most "revolutionary war movie of all time".The movie structure is like a poem. It shakes you in the beginning, it calms you in the middle and it destroys you in the end verses. First of all... the first battle on Omaha beach... the moving camera... the embed-ed reporter like camera... following the soldiers to the beach... the explosions, arms, legs torn apart, the fear on soldiers faces... the numbness... the on-and-off going sound after the bombs go off... MAN! After seeing it for the first time... I went out of the movie theater... and went to see it again for the second time! There has never been a movie that glued me to the chair... and made me stare for 25 minutes in silence! Well, that was a... romantic experience and I give Spielberg credit for that.The middle of the movie... is exactly the opposite of the first. It's not loud and disturbing... but silent and green. I must say it's the greenest grass I have seen in a war movie... the soldiers walk and walk and speak about stupid stuff... like they never went thru hell in the landing at Omaha beach. When I watched this middle section I almost felt good, but it felt very unnatural... and that's why after the assault on the MG-42 nest... I felt shaken again. The dying red cross soldier shot in the stomach... dying... in the arms of comrades... UFFF. Some disturbing images.And of course... the last part... the total destruction, the panzer's rolling thru the streets, the sniper... the self-made sticky bombs... the ruble of houses, the fights one on one... wow. Some serious sequences...I admired the photography, the clean pictures, however it is the moving camera that makes this movie revolutionary... I think no director is able to make again a credible war movie without the Spielberg's moving camera... and that's why I consider him a GENIUS. I haven't seen a war movie with static cameras after S.P.R came out.I must say that this movie can be judged in many ways... you can always see a "shallow characterization" or even a demagogic view on the Jew-German combat in the house... of course. However... if I exclude my political view of this movie I would say that this is probably one of the best I have ever seen.Only the Russian movie "Come and See" (orig. Idi i Smotri) made even a harder impact on my view on what war is. And that's why I consider Saving Private Ryan if not the best, then second best war movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's best film to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the movie theater. The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind. It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film. Sorry, Shakespeare in Love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest war film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the opening sequence when I saw the man's face and I was preparing myself for a long flashback, a growing sense of dread overcame me. Yet still I was not prepared for the horror that I was exposed to for the next 2 1/2 hours. Horror is the only way to describe this film. I wasn't simply watching the film. I was absorbed into it. Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there, and for good reason too. He can make a film like no one else. Everything here works so well, the acting, the action sequences, the atmosphere and emotion. It's all here, and highly energized. This, along with Schindler's List, one of the greatest films in cinematic history. is Spielberg's masterpiece. One of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer Janusz Kiminski. The grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly, and the lighting is superb because even when it's a sunny day, it's still covered in darkness. People have criticized this film for having a bad storyline. That's not true, not at all. While the storyline is simple and nothing new, it's because that's what it would have been like in real life. Life is not a intricately woven storyline like say The Silence of the Lambs, and the people with this film know that. The key to making this film work is making it real. And that it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My point of view...I'm not sure to cry or vomit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember seeing this film almost five years ago, and I was never so sickened by any film in my life! Why? Because Spielberg gave us a hell of a view of war!!! This film is not that of history, save for the opening, gore fest battle that contained more than blood and missing limbs like previous war films like Platoon or Glory. I can easily understand that war is hell, which I'm glad Spielberg revelaed to the world for a change. I'm not a gore lover, but this really caught me off guard since I'm used to such violence from films as of Braveheart and The Full Metal Jacket. However, I have to confess that all I got from this film was blood and guts.So, after an agonizing thirty minutes of constant brutality, the film picks up with a story of about a band of four brothers, three of them are already dead, and only one remsins. So, a small force of eight men, including portrayals of popular stars such as Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore, who didn't do much except shoot Germans with machine guns. They are to find this man, retrieve him before he is killed, which would result in the devastation of a his family. A very selfless task it is, but as the man Ryan is found, after another hour and a half of no character development with these eight men, no feeling for them, or tears and grief...at least from me, and Ryan says he refuses to leave.I laugh and the only reason why this is so is because Spielberg wants another bloody mess, feeling he hasn't shown enough killing! So, another battle happens, with more deaths of both Germans and Americans, leaving this whole film into a usless flashback. So, that's the whole film in a way.I may sound to hate this film, but I don't, but I'm tired of people claiming this is the best war film ever! Heck, other films I've listed above are better than this for goodness sake! However, the realism was well depicted, the music was haunting, and sad, but I had no feeling, except for wanting to lose my lunch in the pit of my stomach, and the usage of sound mixing, editing, and cinematography was truly Oscar worthy. So, since Spielberg put effort into this film, I give a generous ***1/2 out of *****.Seriously, I got nothing accept horrible images, and yearning for a bucket in this two hour and fifty minute film.</fullReview>

Too many people brand their favourite film as 'the greatest film of all time' but if you have seen this film, you will agree with this common statement. However, 'Saving Private Ryan' deserves more than a common statement. The action in the film is intense and the detail has clearly spared no expense. The storyline runs really well with the film and what a cast to play in it. This is Tom Hanks at his best! Not to mention exceptional performances from Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns. Matt Damon did well, however I felt he did not suit the part. Steven Spielburg should be credited for being the greatest film director; not from 'Schindler's List', but from 'Saving Private Ryan'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say Saving Private Ryan is a great war movie would be an understatement. This movie deserves a place in the top 50.This movie would have been nothing without the amazing directing of Steven Spielberg and I'm glad the academy honored him. This movie is incredibly violent, but it is to show us what the soldiers of WW2 had to endure. Without that, it would not have been as powerful.John Williams also delivers a very good musical score throughout the film I especially enjoyed the cinema verite technique utilized by Spielberg to give us the feel that we're on the battlefield with the other soldiers.And, of course, there is Tom Hanks. One of his best performances. He is undeniably one of the best actors of all time. I'm glad that he and Spielberg teamed up for this. It wouldn't have been the same without either of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film "this movie is based on a true story." It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...if Spielberg had resisted the urge to tack a big set piece on to the last 30 minutes.Imagine watching the same movie except this time it ends at the point that they catch up with Private Ryan.Up to that point Spielberg had shown such restraint and subtlety it was disappointing to see it had been thrown away for a silly crowd pleaser. The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of war as well as the lives that are wasted in a way that no previous movie had even attempted.The last 30 minutes on the other hand seem to follow the usual approach, glamorising the whole experience with all the usual heroics and bittersweet sentimentality that we have seen in a thousand war movies before.Still having said that, this is still an excellent movie and is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>=== CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS === This movie is one of the most beautiful movies ever seen. As a fan of WW2 based movies I've seen a lot of such movies, but none of those movies can be compared with the beautiful story of a group soldiers in search of a soldier, named James Ryan, who they don't know, and never saw, willing to give their lives for the job, to find him. in the meantime, a bond between the soldiers exists. one by one their comrades die, only to save one unknown one who is maybe already dead...I can tell you a lot of this movie, but the best way is to find out yourself and watch the movie. you'll not regret it. it's only not suited for people who can't stand blood in movies... think about the first 30 minutes of the movie (Omaha Beach). If you like the turmoil and especially the drama part of WW2, then I'll recommend you to watch this superb movie. And of course, it's directed by Steven Spielberg :p (hope that my first review is alright) :DNow, the only thing I have to do is to watch Band of brothers :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is Unpleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a lot of gratuitous scenes of violence (Don't need Hollywood to show me that war is a violent activity). The movie has a lot of stereotypical characters (Don't need Hollywood to portray soldiers as being foul-mouthed and grimy). The movie has a pretentious story (Don't believe that even the U. S. Army would risk 10 soldiers to locate one, and an enlisted solder at that, in the middle of one of the biggest operations in the history of warfare). But what saves this movie from being a complete dud is Tom Hanks's portrayal of Captain Miller. Hanks's performance is not just wonderful, it is superlative. Captain Miller is a civilian who now finds himself in combat and the conflict between his civilian background and military responsibilities is what this movie is about. Because of this conflict, Captain Miller suffers, emotionally as well as physically. We observe how Captain Miller goes through a process of breaking down as his situation becomes more and more untenable. And when the private in question is found, yet refuses to leave, Captain Miller begins to completely unravel as he realizes that his mission has failed and that the men in his unit who died - under Captain Miller's command - had died in vain. Captain Miller literally becomes a nervous wreck, but nevertheless he fights on, courageous and strong till the ultimate moment arrives marking the end of Captain Miller's life. For Captain Miller is a hero and his character is symbolic of every citizen-soldier who answered the call to duty, and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best portrayals of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie was based on fact, which means that the actual events that are depicted in the movie may not have happened exactly as portrayed, but represent real events that did take place. If many who saw this film complain about the lack of historical basis, lack of minorities, lack of whatever, then get over it. Some events took place in World War II that did not actually include members of all races or nations. As for those who say the film is boring, then I can only suppose that real life situations don't hold much appeal for you. If you're that disconnected from the real world, go back to your video game.World War II was a very grim time in the history of our civilization, and it would be difficult to find anyone who actually participated in battle during this period to disagree with me. I've known many soldiers, and I've never met one that wished for the awful, bloody, sickening carnage that is combat, especially the all-or-nothing circumstances that were all to real in this world between 1939 and 1945. Soldiers are simply people who are willing to fight for their country. In World War II, many of the American combatants were drafted, and some did refuse to fight, as is the case in any war, but most served, with or without distinction or recognition, but did what they felt was their duty. Infantry soldiers, even Ranger captains like John Miller were often ordinary people very much removed from the lives they wanted to be living. Every country that participated in World War II lost many John Millers, decent, ordinary people that were just doing their duty to the best of their ability.For those who complain about the stark portrayal of combat as being too brutal, I suggest you just live in your dream world where when a steel projectile strikes human flesh, the body just simply falls to the ground. You are living in a dream world to think this is so. Combat invariably involves gruesome situations. Body parts are blown away, blood and gore flies. "War is Hell" is not just a saying; it's the absolute truth. Saving Private Ryan depicts combat with more accuracy than most war films in the past have done. Watching this film will put the average person much closer to the actual feeling of being in combat than almost anything else. As for those that hate to be reminded of accurate depictions of history, there is a saying: Those who ignore history will repeat it. This movie, and the war it depicts hopefully have taught us some valuable lessons. I hope we never forget them.If you're offended by a movie that shows the American flag, then don't watch it. The realistic depiction of the USA as a patriotic nation in the 1940's might be a little too much for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is quite possibly the best World War II-inspired movie ever.I know, it's not at all historically accurate. I know, there are plot points that don't make sense. I know and understand all these criticisms.As a film, however, and as a statement on what war is and how war affects people, this film is Top Notch and should have won the Best Picture Oscar the year it was released.This film has exciting, graphic, horrifying and realistic battle footage. The opening montage alone represents the best film-making possible regardless of technology.The cast is simply brilliant, not a lame or hackneyed performance in the bunch. Tom Hanks is again Oscar-worthy, and if they had an Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast this film would have won hands-down.This film is absolutely *nothing* like the cheesy WWII movies with John Wayne or Henry Fonda or Ernest Borgnine. This film is not all jingoistic patriotism, it is a real look at what real war is like, with heroic soldiers and cowardly soldiers and soldiers simply trying to do their jobs and survive. It shows the futility of war and the necessity of war. And it pulls no punches in showing the horrors of war.Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrifically written, truly an amazing piece of film-making.10 out of 10 for an inspiring film.Barky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell after all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like "E.T. the Extraterrestrial" (1982) or "Hook" (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with "Schindler's List" (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned "Schindler's List"), but after seeing "Saving Private Ryan" (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: "Saving Private Ryan" is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of "Saving Private Ryan," but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. "Saving Private Ryan" is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant fault this film in anyway,shape or form. Absolutely brilliant. Tom Hanks once again proves that he still is one of the best actors of our generation and there's also a little part for vin diesel. Now just recently i have started my war film collection and now own most of the best ones out there, but still this film has to be the most accurate and exhilarating one of them all. Private James Ryan's three brothers have been killed in action and to save the heart ache of their poor mother (even more) Captain John Miller and his squad of highly trained soldiers are sent further behind enemy lines to find Ryan and return him to his mother safely. As you can probably gather not everything goes to plan otherwise the film would be over before we finished our brews, faced with impossible odds, the men start to question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer- and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honour, decency and courage. If you like this and lets face it if u don't then u don't like a brill war film i recommend band of brothers, which is a mini drama series on a para squad in WW2. Tom Hanks also present that too.</fullReview>

They are the most graphic and horrific depiction one could imagine being translated onto screen. And, as a Brit who has also been to the beaches in question, I felt extremely humbled and thankful for the incredible sacrifices made. But this is a film, not a vote on the actual perfomance of the heoric men who fought to rid Europe of evil. And I'm afraid the second half of the film gets progressively worse until we are left with a silly tale about Tom Hanks saving the world. This is a real shame.

There is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very well.The last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first. It was very disappointing to me personally. In reality the German military was highly trained and professional. In this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min.

		<fullReview>Watching "Saving Private Ryan" was one of my greatest cinematic experiences. The first twenty minutes of the film is truly astonishing. It's as if I was actually running up the beach, with bullets going all around me, slicing people to bits and bombs blowing off everywhere, tearing everyone to shreds. There was a feeling of total hopelessness of the existing and forthcoming carnage around me.I remember when I first saw the film, there was somebody left of me who was so traumatized by the Omaha invasion sequence, she covered her eyes and went out of the theater. There was a seemingly hardened old man right of me who said he has never have seen such horrifying experience in his life.Yes, this film has many flaws. I found the script to be very conventional and there were many corny cliches. The characters are not very well developed. Even the tank battle at the end, an amazing scene than matched the Omaha scene in tension, is pretty much Hollywoodized; it showed many military inaccuracies. I had participated in message boards that many military analysts rightfully criticized the ending as being very unrealistic.However, it's still hard to not say this is a groundbreaking powerhouse of a war film that will (and had probably already) changed Hollywood war cinema forever. The intense violence of this film will teach generations of people that war is not fun and games. War really sucks.</fullReview>

While thousands of Americans, Brits, Aussies, Canadians, Free French and others are dying fighting Hitler's army and Luftwaffe, Spielberg is leading a campaign of mighty forces to pull a lone American out of the combat zone no matter what the cost. To use the world's greatest invasion from the sea as the mere backdrop to a story is, to me, perverse, and trivializes the extraordinary efforts both of the men who fought during the Normandy invasions and the earlier generation of filmmakers who sought to portray that effort on a grand, much nobler canvas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a war movie that is so horrifying and moving that it can't be anything else than the best.Everything is great about this movie, great actors, great battle sequences and a good ending. It really shows the horrors of the wars, not like the old WWII war movie where the American soldiers were immortal men that ran around showing the American flag.Here we have no heroes, just losers. Because the only enemy they are fighting is the war itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed at how much stupid some people manage to say...Let's just get a few facts straight. On Omaha Beach, Sector Dog Green, there were only americans. No brits, no canadians, no aussies, no russians, no polish, and so on. I know they all lost men, but on Omaha, and in Saving Private Ryan, there were just Americans. We have one story here, and it would be wrong to bring in people who weren't there. So if you want to see a movie about non-american soldiers in WWII, you should go and see something else, and not complain about this movie.And what kind of person can find the american flag in the end of the movie disgusting? 2500 men DID give their life on that beach in the fight for a free world, and here we have some b******(s) complaining about the flag. This movie is a tribute to the men who fought and died there. I say they should move to Cuba or China or Iraq, where those twisted ideas still live.It's a great movie that everybody should see. It's rated 18 (min 18 years old) here in Norway, which is a little high I think. It should be 15, so that schools could go and see it, so that we don't get more morons who takes freedom for granted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnificient. Simply. And horrible, even if a movie, so close to the hell it was on these days, is not close enough to what simple young men had to suffer. A great feeling of despair and the question : why should they have to get killed? at the end of the movie. Because, in a nightmare like this, there is no good purpose to die for, even for their country, as some generals, the ass in their office, would explain.The friendship those guys shared was beyond brotherhood in this time. think about those who died. those who suffered.but, more than anything, to those who survived and make us live. Soldiers who died deserve more than respect. They deserve a think sometimes, a sincere tear on their graves, not for what they won but for what they suffer, and they deserve a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking as a pretext a story about a soldier who must be rescued by the fact that all his brothers have been killed in battle during World War II, Spielberg takes his ideas on the emotions of this war , and experiences a vision of its meaning, and search and principles of decency amid an atmosphere of war.With this work, Spielberg gives us one of the best portraits of what war really is , with all its harshness and drama. The first scenes of the Normandy landings and are part of film history and possibly be treated to some of the best and most striking images of a sequence of war on a movie screen. Well sure, it's like the battle of WW2 took place. " Saving Private Ryan" is pure war movies , but even more because the story is very well argued and developed an unrivalled expertise, because the director knows his job perfectly and resources at its disposal .The landing at Normandy is a famous event in history, but had never been photographed in this way: the rawness and emotion are something that will displayed marked many. The sequence is powerful, not making concessions, and it's a chilling moment. The shots are wonderful (underwater, hand -held camera in pursuit, sudden movements and pauses, open beach shots, "close- ups "... ) and editing and audio are superb . The scenes are very raw (no shots where hard to keep looking and definitely have physical responses to what you see), but it is a sequence that will become a classic. There are many war tapes that deal with rawness and explore the feelings of the concept, but I dare say that none had hit me so.I think it's one of the best war movies of our times as well as being visually spectacular, tells a war not just limited to bullets and explosions but also the reactions of each of the soldiers with their fears and anxieties as any person. In short, we have a real gem of cinema that will endure over time and like fine wine, every time we know better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No advance information prepared me for this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born 9 years after WW2 finished and my father was a fireman in the midlands area of England during the war. I do not know anybody who was directly involved in any fighting so therefore the only way somebody like me can be educated in what has taken place during any war is with documentaries, books or a realistic portrayal of events in a war film. I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically. I personally thank the director and the entire cast and crew for the result of all their hard work. For anybody out there who has not seen this film please watch it and if possible stop reading this stuff I have written and lob the DVD into the machine and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg salutes the Veterans of World War II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage," according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, "Saving Private Ryan" impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called "The Greatest Generation"; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's "Ryan" (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the "war mother" dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' "Miller" in his final words to student Damon's "Ryan"; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual "Upham" character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an "ensemble acting" film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor "Wade" to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to "Mama". Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's "Horvath" serves as the "voice" of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line ("Except this time, the mission is a man").Spielberg's use of "flashback" is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term "gut-wrenching decision." ********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perposterous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is a highly competent director, who has a brilliant knack for making the right film at the right time. This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being "the best war movie of all time."Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony. What country in WW II - other than the USA - could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died??? I can only imagine the jeers that must greet this idea when the film is shown in, say, Russia -- where tens of millions died, with no such convenient reprieves and nowhere to flee in any case. Or in England, where whole families had no choice but to soldier their way through the Blitz. The fact is, the soldiers of the USA were relatively unique in having a safe haven to return *to.* Saving Private Ryan not only manages to forget that fact, it somehow tries to make American troops seem the more heroic for it!I say the irony is unintentional... In fact, I long wondered if Spielberg had *meant* the story-line of Private Ryan ironically. But a recent interview on TCM convinces me that he did not. That's a shame. Done deliberately, this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powers-that-be manipulate fighting men in the field. Instead, it's more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor. I have no idea how prevalent the "Private Ryan" reprieve really was; but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire force.On the positive side, there's no denying the production is well-mounted. I give the film 3 stars, chiefly for the technical brilliance of the opening sequence - and for the presence of the always-watchable Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of Alltime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was a young'un. It had an impact on me, more than I could have imagined. At that time (I was still a kid then) I wanted to join the Army, because I assumed that I could simply pull out a machine-gun and blast everyone to oblivion. This movie made me see the light. Now that I'm older, and can understand films better, I can fully appreciate the beauty of this film. It's gritty without being gruesome, it's brutally honest without overwhelming you, it's funny while it focuses on the drama; it's just plain brilliant. It deserved every Oscar it got, and more in my opinion. The cinematography alone is to die for.All in all, 11/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good you forget that it is a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can watch it over and over again. It also has one of my favorite actors of all time, Tom Hanks. This movie should have been Tom Hanks 5th Oscar but for some reason the 'academy' has some bias against him.Many people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense, realistic capture of the invasion of Normandy beach. In addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets, bombs and screams all around you.Does not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie. It shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides US forces, German forces and by standing citizens.This movie to me was the best film of 1998. Unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive Oscar runs in history. Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Elizabeth and Life is beautiful all competed that year. And as always the Lovey-dovey movies mostly win the Oscar races.Still this movie was so great that it spawned a HBO miniseries that was equally great "Band of Brothers".This is my favorite movie from Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg mines a sullied gem with this bloody classic. A family film, I say, a demonstration of brotherhood and integrity. For me the decision to seek Private Ryan based on the mother's loss simultaneously undermines and glorifies the honour of war. And it is in this background that Hanks delivers a compelling performance worthy of many rewatches.The violence in this film is stark. So many examples you can think of - from the escaped German prisoner's revenge, to the sockbomb victim - show the arbitrary nature of violence. But the quieter moments between are tender and contemplative - Fubar anyone? Not a realist film, like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, but art to provoke, like Jar Head and Apocalypse Now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest war movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 minutes of this film is a brutal glimpse into the violence and complete uselessness of war. We see people getting gunned down, limbs getting blown off, people blown in half, guts everywhere, it is not a pretty sight. It's this, and many other things, that make this one of the greatest war films I've ever seen.Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are sent on a mission to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). Along the way many hardships are faced and overcome between these men.That is pretty much the plot, but the movie is more than plot. It is a journey through World War II's harshness and a journey with these men. We come to care for these men. They aren't given huge amounts of development, but they don't need it. The actors really make us care for these people, as does Steven Spielberg's skillful directing. This is definitely one of his best movies.It is also a lot different. If any of his movies contain violence, there is very little of it. This, however, contains some of the most graphic violence I've ever seen. It truly shows the violence, dirtyness and uselessness of war. It doesn't offer anything but pain and misery. John William's score also creates a very suitable mood.The only reasons I have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end. The American flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and I found it unnecessary.4?/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be afraid to criticize this film! You can still be patriotic and not like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has claimed in interviews that one of his purposes in making Saving Private Ryan was to specifically honor the soldiers who fought that war; a noble sentiment. But being a film buff, you'd think Spielberg would be familiar with the constant stream of films from the 40's through the 50's into the 60's and beyond including TV shows that did just that. It makes me wonder if he had another purpose in making Saving Private Ryan.He does. In the excellent series of interview DVD's put out by the American Film Institute titled The Directors, in the episode devoted to Spielberg he claims that he wanted to make Saving Private Ryan with a documentary style eschewing the Chapman Cranes and Steadicam approach to big budget film-making. He wanted the film to look exactly like a war photographer would have shot it had he been at Omaha Beach.Clearly, one look at the opening beach sequence shows he succeeded in that desire. But if Chapman cranes and Steadicams are not realistic, is artificially slowing down the film OK? How about de-saturating the color out of the film to make it almost seem black and white? What about heavily manipulating the soundtrack? Does war really exist in Dolby 5.1 Sound? I mean, what are we REALLY watching here? What has Spielberg done with Saving Private Ryan other than simply add an element of "Chainsaw Massacre Movie" gore to the war film, a genre that is surprisingly non-gory. But the thing that annoys me most about Saving Private Ryan is something that is no real fault of the film. It's the way so many people fatuously praise the film as being "realistic". A bunch of different critics even stated that this film "avoids all the clichés" usually associated with WWII films.Avoids clichés? Have any of you seen it? Well, lets just start with the squad who goes after Private Ryan in the film, do we have the tough, but decent guy from the Midwest? Check, Tom Hanks! Do we have a vaguely ethnic type? Check, Vin Diesel as Caparzo. How about the young coward who later on shows courage? Check with Jeremy Davies character. What about the wise guy from New York? Check with Ed Burns. Did we forget the country boy sharpshooter? No, we have Barry Pepper as a cross kissing sniper. You may just as well have cast Anthony Quinn, Wally Cassel, William Bendix, Lloyd Nolan and Richard Jaeckel. Certainly, John Wayne would have been perfect for the Tom Hanks role.Staying with realism, does Spielberg even get the facts of Omaha Beach right? The real plan was for the men to secure the beach and then have bulldozers knock down the sea wall. Tanks would then blast through German fortifications and then the men would follow the tanks. What really happened was that the water and tides were unexpectedly strong and the men were washed completely off course. That's why they landed directly in front of German machine gun nests; they certainly weren't heading there on purpose. After suffering terrible human losses and with the water being too deep for the tanks, (only 2 of the 29 tanks ever made it), the surviving men waited at the sea wall for five or six hours until German fire had died down and then they climbed up the sides of the bluffs, double-backed and attacked the Germans from behind, eventually over running them. That's what really happened. I found that out by simply looking this battle up in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Apparently, that is something no one at Paramount Pictures did because that is not what happens in the "realistic" Saving Private Ryan.Spielberg presents the Omaha Beach slaughter as if this is what happened all over on D-Day. Again, not true, in fact, troop casualties were much less than expected. Yes, more than 2000 soldiers died at Omaha Beach, which saw the fiercest fighting and was a terrible slaughter, but a fifteen miles down the coastline at Utah Beach, they suffered less than 200 casualties and even less to the north at Juno and Gold beaches. I'm not trying to be disingenuous here. I know Saving Private Ryan was about this specific group going into this particular battle, but overall, what was presented in Saving Private Ryan is not what most soldiers faced that day.But what is really unforgivable to me, if you watch Saving Private Ryan, is you will get no sense that anybody other than Americans were involved in this action. Remember, it was called The Allied Invasion, not The American Invasion, which might explain why Saving Private Ryan is hailed as being accurate over here, but in other countries, notably Britain and Canada, who also lost soldiers that day, they find this film laughable.Nobody minds that Spielberg fudged things historical in order to make a dramatic movie. But pretending you didn't is wrong. And yes, just because Paramount Pictures says this is the way it happened, don't make it so. Saving Private Ryan is clearly a well-intentioned film and was made with skill and care. But, ultimately it is nothing more than a feel good picture, full of flag waving banalities and video game style violence. It is World War II: The Ride. Steven Spielberg has made a gripping and entertaining film with Saving Private Ryan. But that's all. Let's save our Medals of Honor for those who show bravery in an actual war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no expert on the Normandy landings, but I know enough to know that the opening scenes of the movie, so highly lauded as realism, were pure hokum. Though there may have been some landing craft whose occupants were slaughtered as the doors opened, and whose few survivors were then further decimated on the beach, less than 10% of those who landed on Omaha Beach were injured or killed. So what was the point of showing the fountains of blood? We know war is hell. Showing it realistically is gruesome enough, without stretching the truth.The movie went downhill from there. The next three hours were spent tediously watching a single squad of a men walking all around 400 square miles of France asking whether anyone has seen Private Ryan. How ridiculously absurd. Again I must ask, what was the point? It stretched credulity beyond the limit.I think the biggest reason I was so disappointed in this movie is that it was so highly acclaimed by critics when it was released. I can't imagine why.</fullReview>

I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: "So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans" or "Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys." You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies.

		<fullReview>This movie is the greatest war movie ever! Tom Hanks was a perfect captain and Matt Damon was such a great Private Ryan. The beach scene was such a great scene, although it was pretty intense the way that Steven Speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic. Another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didn't know where her forth son was. It made me feel like crying and I'm sure that all the other fans out there felt the same way.The ending is very dramatic, but Steven didn't go overboard. When the old James Ryan almost starts to cry I felt the same way. When Tom Hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie. It was awesomely brilliant, but very sad. That's my basic overview and opinion on "Saving Private Ryan." -Ashley</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan will probably be remembered as a true classic, the best war movie ever made that presented World War II as good as possible... For those who haven't seen the movie - Run, Run and don't look back, go rent it, and enjoy every minute of it. The movie begins with the well known American invasion to Europe in operation Overlord at the problematic Omaha Beach. Never in filming industry had there been a better war scene, so true, so real, making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion... Spielberg didn't censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood, less dead and less wounded. In fact, this scene, showing zero regards to Human life isn't just to make the viewers feel excited, its true purpose will be understood only later, after watching the film...Following the invasion, Cpt Miller (Tom Hanks) gets another mission - "straight from the top" - Rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war. Eight men, rescuing one. After the bloodsheded scene in Omaha, this mission looks rather stupid, one life? is it really worth endangering the lives of eight? Omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes... How is one life that important? Without a doubt, Spielberg didn't randomly choose a mission to base a movie about. This movie isn't just an action film... It has an hidden message, It shows that on the side of war, with so much dead, zero regards for human life we are all still human- those who die at war aren't just soldiers, they're men, with lives, desires, needs - they have names, brothers, sisters - and each and every one of them counts... Omaha is war, it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie - well, thats humanity... Suddenly, one life does count, and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right. Don't get me wrong, the movie is all action. true hardcore action... The rest of the movie, following the invasion, escorts the small squad led by Cpt. Miller as they search for one soldier, Private James Ryan, in occupied France... Endless battle-scenes, action, suspense - actual war... I will stop here without spoiling any part of the film - This movie cant be described in words... Abseloutly amazing... best movie i have ever seen - A MUST SEE! although i doubt any true movie-fan would skip watching this movie...</fullReview>

This is one of the most memorable films ever made, and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date. I am a proud Canadian citizen, but this film gave me a greater respect for what the Americans were trying to do in Europe. I used to protest the fact that they joined the war late, however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that war.The film truly was an epic, an epic that will leave me to think for some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold. This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war. And whenever I go to visit Washington D.C., I have more American pride then ever. I am more than proud to give this movie a10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie, then a long boring few hours to end it. Very unrealistic overall. Hardly a great war movie. If we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie, then we have been fooled greatly.If it is really saving Private Ryan, then why no scenes of Private Ryan until the movie is almost over? Well, if there had been, then they couldn't have played that little prank on the viewers of the first Private Ryan saved being the wrong one (Matt Damon).If you are going to watch this movie, have plenty of coffee, because after the first half you will fall asleep quick. This is just another stage for Tom Hanks, a mediocre actor that the studios keep trying to push down our throats (except for Forrest Gump, a role he was well equipped for). I give it 5 of 10 stars, because of a few good scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30 minutes of gore followed by 120 of stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out with a recreation of the Normandy landings. Plenty of gore, some humor which may have been untintentional. The US army platoon shows they know how to stay alive, use cover, not take foolish chances, etc. The whole landing was better shown in "The Longest Day" without the gore but this first sequence was effective. Next the platoon is asked to find 1 particular solider. At this point the boys seem to leave all their brains behind. They decide to fight to the death over some meaningless bridge, commit one act of stupidity after another. This would make some sort of sense if they were green troops but they spent the whole first half hour showing how good they were at fighting. Everyone I know thought the whole last section of the movie, irritating, stupid, or worse. How it got such a high rating is beyond me. After you sit through it once you will never want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful and toilsome-the audience is the victim of the shooting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the most intensely boring, long-winded uninspiring 'movie' i have ever seen. spielberg can brilliantly bring a childhood fantasy to life but he has a lot to learn about making a deep and inspiring movie. schindler's list must have been a one off. the gore was pure hollywood, and once it was over the movie began a gruelling downward spiral involving the rest of the poor suffering audience.the acting of giovanni ribisi was the only consolation (soothed but did not heal) and tom hank's peformance was tolerably mediocre.all in all, a terrible waste of time. sure the people of our generation need a much needed history lesson in the bravery of our ancestors, sure we need to see a full-on assault of the gore to fully comprehend the horror of war but as an audience we also need a film with a sense of direction than endless gunfire combined with lacklustre dialogue. please do not insult ourintelligence, we are not so stupid that we cannot perceive the central message by sitting for 2.5 hrs watching this tripe. a subtler approach would have been much more effective, or (since apparently we need to witness first hand the shocking violence for the full impact)a movie with the gore but toned down, compressed and concentrated -not splattered whereever it 'felt' appropriate. giving spielberg the oscar for this show/exhibition was like giving the nobel peace prize to monica lewinsky. i could definitely see the agony of war, but the agony of watching this filthy excuse of a film was a greater tax on my forebearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that captures the character of a generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read dedjim's comments on this movie. His are the best by far. I'm sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie review.This was a great movie about sacrifice, courage, loss, violence, revenge, folly, and most of all the strength of character it took (and takes) to defeat evil. The young people of that time defeated fascism (and later communism). Their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war. This reality explains much about the differences between the generations. Theirs was one of stoicism. The ones that followed were less mature, and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective - I say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bents.This movie is a more accurate "experience" of WW2 than most movies made on the subject. My next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humor-filled men I have ever known. He never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated WW2 bomber pilot. But he was. He came from a humble background; was wounded in the war; lost many friends in the war; and met his future wife (Army nurse) during the war. Then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country, he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world. I came to know him better after his death by talking to his family about the experiences he went thru during the turning point in history known as WW2.This movie is a masterpiece made by one of the masters in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this movie was well made. I am not going to sit here and act like I know what happened over there, because I don't. This movie shows what the war was like through the eyes of the soldiers who fought in it. It is a vivid and graphic portrayal of war during World War 2. The movie is intense, but is important to watch. The cast does a great job. They put this feeling on you that is hard to describe. In my opinion this is one Spielberg's best films. He does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men, the struggle for survival. He also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter. This is one of my favorite movies because of the action, plot, and acting. At the end of this film you might feel sad, but not disturbed. This film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country I live in. It also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace. If you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies, I highly recommend this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyped as the most realistic war movie ever - gimme a break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes are great but after that the movie makes little sense. Aside from the totally ridiculous plot, the actions of the characters is pure hollywood fiction. The way they walk around nonchalantly, the bars on Hank's helmet (why not a bull's-eye), and the ridiculous notion of a sniper going anywhere near a bell tower are the things that bothered me the most. Why would they face overwhelming odds to save a bridge that the engineers could rebuild in a day? Denying it to the fleeing Germans would have been the priority. Faced with the odds that they were up against even a corporal would have had the military sense to blow the bridge before the Germans arrived and have everyone safely on the other side. Hey Spielberg, What's with the neo-nazi skinhead German soldiers? I have never seen a photograph of a WWII German soldier with a haircut remotely resembling this. I realize that actual soldiers were used as extras but you have to assume actors were given the speaking/close-up roles. Expected much more from all of the hype ? sorely disappointed by all the Hollywood glam.</fullReview>

But what happens then? Ryan turns out to be Mr. All American Hero. He doesn't waste a thought for his three fallen brothers, he doesn't give a damn about his grieve-stricken mother (she will understand ? will she?), but insists on defending that little bridge? After Schindler's list and Amistad, Ryan's not Spielberg's best film. In fact, the second half makes private Ryan to any warfilm, the Pentagon or any other war-ministry in the world would be proud of. Just a little war-adventure under the checkered flag.

		<shortDescription>A pile of corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I successfully avoided this until seeing Band of Brothers, which raised my previously low interest in Spielberg productions; having seen one too many of his mawkish, sentimental pieces of malarkey. Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone &amp; lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought. S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts &amp; having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, "CRY NOW!" and "WAVE THE FLAG!" I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows &amp; Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons. Structurally this feels like a grab-bag of scenes made for an even longer movie. They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi... I can't imagine any of these guys are WW2 figures because they're all so overexposed in the current timeframe.I didn't need this giant pile of malarkey and all it's cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the Allies in WW2. I have reality to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan has to be one of the greatest films of all time and is personally my favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg has captured war as it really is. All detail is considered to make this movie one of the most, if not the most accurate war film ever created. The actors performances are brilliant especially that of Tom Hanks. This movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture. After watching this film I have now gained a greater knowledge of what war really consists of and therefore gained a greater respect for those veterans who served during D-Day especially and in general WWII. I would very much recommend it to anyone. One of Spielbergs best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No movie will ever stand up to the ranks over Saving Private Ryan. Just wow. Thats really all I can say. Flawless special affects, definitely look real. No other war movie goes into this much detail to a battle scene. I can feel for the souls of those lost, and sorrow for that poor guy with intestines hanging out screaming, ''Momma!'' You think thats so typical, but what would you scream when you were in his position? ''Crayola Crayons! Ahhhhhh!'' But seriously I sat on my couch staring at the screen 5 minutes after the credits were over. Shocked that the main character was killed. But I liked it. Mostly everyone died trying to save PVT. Ryan except wimpy clumsy Umpham (sp?) and Reiben which was a little surprising but made sense. The only flaw is that if you were a Captain in the US Army you would NOT blindfold the enemy and have him walk to somebody finds him. 1) He could slip the blindfold off and run in the direction of a German platoon. 2) He may come back to haunt you.And if you just go out there and buy the movie (worth every penny, simply a classic!) and watch it you'll know what I mean. Thats the only flaw I know of, but it does'nt hurt the way I feel about the movie. I just get this vibe that everything that happened in the movie just feels right, and is perfect the way it unfolded. Saving Private Ryan will remain in my heart forever. As well as millions of other. This is Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks at their best. (and everyone else who had to do with the slightest bit of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the first war movies that i've seen, and it has to be one of the best. Steven Spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece. The movie is accurate,although there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is. From the beginning of the film, Spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on Omaha beach, a view of the whole allied advance on Normandy, once the Axis trenches and bunkers have been taken. The way Spielberg captivates each character within one another, and yet be different from one another is superb. I think Steve Spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship, which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers. The cinematography has to be credited, and the background music is fitting for such a film, thats why i gave it 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most historically accurate view of World War II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Several spoilers ahead**** This is, without a doubt, the most historically accurate view of world war II. Starting with the d-day invasion, I could already tell this was going to be an epic movie, and it did not disappoint. The tag line says it all; the mission is a man. But it's not just any man: It's Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Not only that, but his mother is getting all three telegrams the same day. And on top of it all, Private Ryan is behind enemy lines. So, the chief of the U.S. Army sends Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his troops to rescue him. When they finally find Private Ryan, 2 of Miller's men have already died, and Private Ryan does not want to leave his position at a bridge. So what do they do? Blow up the bridge. But it does not have a happy ending as Captain Miller ends up dying in the dramatic climactic shootout. At the end, it shows a much older Private Ryan, looking at the grave of the captain, the man who saved his life. Now for the accurate part: the beginning of the movie. There was a lot of controversy about the level of violence what with the major internal organs shown out of the bodies, but this is what war is. Beyond controversial and not pretty. Possibly the greatest war movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disgustingly sentimental Americano tosh, but I liked it once...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>call me cynical, or perhaps heartless, but on second viewing of this overrated film I saw straight through it. When I first saw it I was 13 years old. I was angry and angst ridden, and utterly impressionable. The film affected me. It made me rant for weeks about what evil "ba*****s" the French must have been during the war, and resent my French and German lessons. I didn't question it because before then I hadn't even seen a movie that reached the standards of The Shawshank Redemption, not that this is a bad film, on the contrary, it is beautiful and fantastic, but the point remains that I was decidedly naive when I saw it. Fortunately, I have seen the light. I am now a film studies student and I have fallen in love with movies that make this one look, well, empty. It's nothing, really, to be honest, that Stanley Kubrick didn't do better in Full Metal Jacket. Ok, I admit that the first scene is well choreographed, well photographed, well conceived and genuinely moving. However, it seems to me that there might have been better ways to go about it, really. Someone else would have made a hugely better job of this. And well done Spielburg for Jurassic Park but I can never forgive him for inventing the Blockbuster movie with Jaws, paving the way for big family-fun action-adventure-explosion-fests. Grrrrrrrrrr. The film was sickeningly sentimental to the point of being really "corny", in every American sense of the world. This is accelerated by the string score, which, like in most big films that want to pull the heart strings, it tells you, TELLS YOU(!), exactly when you should be feeling sad. EUGH! And what exactly is with the American flag filling the screen whilst blowing in the breeze and fading to the D-Day landings? This is such a blatant and screaming use of patriotic symbolism, it doesn't make me proud, it doesn't make me relate to the story, it doesn't do anything but make me puke. Seriously. Don't eat me.

		<fullReview>I have to agree, this is really good historical fiction, one note however... there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a Yen-yang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet, which would be the 29th Infantry Division (a National Guard Unit), instead of either a diamond with a #2 (2nd Rangers, which we saw) or a #5 (which we didn't see). As far as I can find, only the 2nd and 5th Rangers were in the first wave of the assault, led by then LTC James Earl Rudder, and thus there should have been no 29th Inf, at least not in the first wave. A couple of really good books on the subject is "Rudder's Rangers : The True Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion D-Day Combat Action" and "The Liberation of Pointe Du Hoc : The 2nd Rangers at Normandy, June 6-8, 1944" One thing that would probably suprise most people is that LTC Rudder came onshore with his men, and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach, and that he lived through it. Of course, he was a Texas Aggie, that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed. Read the books, you'll never watch SPR the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along With "Schindler's List", Spielberg's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece. It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department. The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998. Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture. Tom Hanks is also excellent. He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better). In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever. All in all "Saving Private Ryan" is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s. It's a film that will be remembered for decades to come. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Band Of Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 'Schindler's List' and 'Amistad', Spielberg once again takes us to a dark path in one of his best works, 'Saving Private Ryan' (set during WWII, D-Day). He went through great lengths to make the film historically accurate. Though the movie is fiction, much of it is based on real history. At the same time, he manages to give the film a soul.It is not just historical events, blood, gore, massacre, bomb blasts and firearms, but the viewer genuinely cares about the characters and roots for the platoon section to make it and feels sadness by the horrible death of each soldier. Alongside the director and writer, credit goes to the actors for displaying a brotherhood where these ordinary men, strangers to each other, are brought together by a very unusual circumstance. War can have a dehumanizing effect where people tend to get carried away and conflicts arise between the soldiers. We see the men get more frustrated as their hope slips away every time they think they are near to finding Ryan when reality says otherwise. But, these men cope with it and move on further.In a particular scene when Private Reiben is about to walk away, Miller for the first time reveals his identity. His 'unknown' identity had given rise to a lot of curiosity among his soldiers but upon hearing that he was an ordinary school teacher, Reiben is able to relate to that and he stays. From then on, he sees Miller differently. Likewise with Ryan and Miller and Reiben and Ryan (in one small subtle scene).There are two beautiful scenes: one takes place during a night, when the soldiers are chatting and they end up talking about their mothers. In this scene Wade tells his story as he slowly reveals how he wished he had spent more time with his mother. The next day his brutal death devastates the soldiers fueling their frustration while they are forced to stay in control. Another wonderful scene is when an Edith Piaf song plays on the radio. Upham translates the lyrics and this amuses the soldiers and they are drawn into the song allowing themselves a moment of calmness. It is such scenes that reveal the depth of these strong characters.Tom Hanks arguably leads the cast as Captain Miller who is like the elder brother of the band. This is one of his most restrained performances and he is great. But, his supporting cast members that include: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and especially Giovanni Ribisi are at least equally excellent. Paul Giamatti makes a strong appearance. Even Vin Diesel, whom I normally do not like, shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small role.Spielberg makes remarkable use of Kaminski's cinematography, whether it is long shots, jump cuts or various angles. Kahn's editing is smooth. Williams's soundtrack fits the film. The washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceral.For me it was an overwhelming experience because I was so drawn into it. Many have criticized Spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewer's emotion. Well, I prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a magnificent film. It's one of the best and my favourite of its genre.</fullReview>

This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude.</fullReview>

Oh also when they hid out in the church that was good and when it was raining and the dude sniped the guy through the scope. Great sound effects and realistic warfare. I felt like I was right there seeing all of it before my very eyes. I also loved the final battle when they needed to protect the bridge. And then they found the German soldier they didn't kill and in the end, they shot him with a pistol. Ahhhh...what a great movie.

		<fullReview>Yes, "Saving Private Ryan" has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie, but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic: the attitudes, behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts. In particular, some of the major and minor characters of "S.P.R." exhibit very self-absorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during World War II. Sure, people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history, and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical, but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990's guys were like rather than 1940's men. For a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940's troops, try "Battleground."Like many others here, I like war movies to be authentic in depicting things like uniforms, equipment and tactics, and "S.P.R." is successful in some of this, but to me it is more important for a movie to be accurate in depicting character, attitude and the actual events that occurred, and in this "S.P.R" is very lacking. It does a better job of demonstrating Spielberg's 1990's limousine-liberal biases. This is especially seen in the character depictions. Another kind of example which is comparatively minor is how the German troops' haircuts in "S.P.R." tend to look more like those of late-20th Century skinheads than what German SS and Wehrmacht troops usually wore.Also, I think that the reviewer James Bowman makes a good point about movies such as "S.P.R." and "Flags of Our Fathers:" "...perhaps showing too much respect for the suffering is not to show enough respect for the man. For if we suppose, as some of us still do, that these men suffered for something ? to wit, their duty, their honor, their country ? don't these thing deserve just a little bit of respect as well?..."To get an idea of what the Normandy Campaign was like, you would be much better off reading non-fiction accounts of it, and listening to comments by actual men who were there. It takes much more than gushing blood, flying body parts and the message "War is hell" to constitute a great war film. If you want to see cinematic movies which do a better job than "S.P.R." of depicting some of the general look and feel of war, and the characters and attitudes of people of the World War II period, try "Talvisota" and "Der Untergang." Also, "A Bridge Too Far" is very good, especially for a blockbuster-type movie. "A Bridge Too Far" has a few very minor inaccuracies, some composite characters and some simplifications of the real events, but it does an excellent job of showing the characters of troops and civilians, and it is mostly factual. "The Longest Day," while it includes some Hollywood flourishes, also is very good. It doesn't have the special effects and combat realism of "S.P.R.," but it is almost completely based on facts, which counts for a lot with me, and for which I rank it much higher than "S.P.R." "The Longest Day" also has one of the most impressive large-scale depictions of combat in any movie, showing the storming of a German position by a Free French unit.</fullReview>

I suppose this film appeals to the masses that don't have to think about a movie, just accept it as arty as it had couple of drawn out sad scene's, so it must be a masterpiece.I won't bother to go into the racism in the movie, the Germans played as mindless morons that just walk into bullets and of course, us stumbling Europeans, Australians, Russians, etc that actually fought through the entirety of the war.0/10 - Awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the first movie that's kept my eyes glued to the screen, no lie, for at least 30 minutes straight. The opening scene in this movie is incredible. I've never been in war, but after seeing this movie, I know, I just know, that that's what war is like. It's gotta be. Steven Spielberg is amazing in this movie. The performances are amazing. Everything is so well done. Sometimes the camera gets a little too shaky, but you gotta picture it through the eyes of someone who's actually there.I usually get bored with war movies, because it's usually the same crap. But this movie sticks with me. It's gotta be hell to be a soldier. The combat scenes were excellently done, and even though the opening was extremely gruesome and gory, it just had to be that way. The movie is a little long, almost 3 hours, but it's worth the entire watch. The ONLY scene I thought was a little stupid was when they (spoiler) found the wrong Private Ryan and he started crying cuz he thought his brothers were dead. But aside from that, this is the best war movie I've ever seen. Make sure you see this movie! FUBAR!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Old Soldiers, and Young Alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film back in 1998 with my father, who is a WWII veteran who happened to serve in the Pacific Theatre, on Iwo Jima. While on line, he struck up a conversation with another veteran who did happen to serve in the European Theatre, and they discussed old times. But near the end of the conversation, my dad said, "For what? For what?" Something that still resonates with many WWII vets who are still alive, and saw that war was not the prettified heroics pumped out of the Hollywood studios, but a very real, bloody and bewildering hell, fought by the young and vital, male and female alike.The premise of the film being a young man who has already lost several brothers in the service, being saved by a platoon unknown to him has its basis in fact. During the Second World War, many families had several sons who either enlisted, or were drafted, and went into different military units. The five Sullivan brothers, all of whom were lost during the sinking of the USS Juneau, were the most famously representative of this tragedy, and after the war, the practice of multiple draft recipients from one family was eliminated. Does anyone remember the scene where Private Ryan's mother sees an Army car pulling up to her porch? The serviceman and her local clergyman approach her, and she sinks down, struck by the horrible reality they are about to convey. The terrible simplicity of this is deeply moving.There is also a brief scene in the beginning showing a secretarial pool for the Armed Services, where letters for medals, both posthumous and for the living, were typed and sent to families around the country. My mother worked in one of those pools, and it was not an easy job to deal with day by day.Some have asked - why no British soldiers here? This is an American platoon on the Omaha beachhead, not one of Montgomery's units. The daily dangers and horrors of war are vividly portrayed. The deaths aren't pretty, and some of the characters aren't pretty, but that's the way war is (and was). You were in a unit with all types, from different states, and your common goal was to survive - kill, or be killed. There were gloryboys and cowards, and some are shown here.The only maudlin note (and Spielberg can't seem to resist injecting some sentimentality here) is when the mature Ryan, visiting the military cemetery with his family, stops at the grave of his commanding officer John Miller, and asks in tears, "Am I a good man?" In other words - why them, and not me? Why am I here, outliving everyone? It doesn't seem justified to him.There are some terrific performances to take in : Tom Hanks as John Miller, Matt Damon as Pvt. Ryan, Tom Sizemore, and Vin Diesel, to name just a few.The sacrifices of our fathers, uncles, and grandfathers' generation were exemplary. They were the lucky ones who came back to lend their voices to history, and without them, many of us, including myself, would not be here. At the end of the film, I sat there, next to my dad, who was also in tears. I would say, "God bless them, one and all."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's Most Haunting and Visually Stunning Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, you see an elderly man (Whose identity is not revealed until the end), standing at a headstone, in tears. Why? You soon understand the story as we go back in time.It is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach. And it is INCREDIBLY bloody. Soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).This is not an easy mission. Every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns)believes that Pvt. Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. It is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film: will their sacrifice make a difference? By taking a stand to defend the bridge, the answer is obvious: yes.The performances of the actors are powerful; Including Hanks, Burns and Damon, you have Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies. John Williams, who always works well with Spielberg, provides a powerful score. The battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history (And is not for the squeamish). It is a very moving film, and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE SUCKS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know lots of people regard this film one of the greatest war movies ever made blah, blah, blah, but I personally found it one of the most grotesquely overrated pieces of crap I have suffered through in a long time (as far as World War 2 movies go, only the recent version of "The Thin Red Line" was more torturous). While its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking, I found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself, and during the initial scenes where the Allies were landing at Normandy and getting massacred, I found myself inflamed with feelings of BESTIAL WARLUST and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent and/or gory moments (eg where that troop carrier opens up, only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by German machine gunners). Once this part of the movie had ended, however, I found the whole thing rapidly getting boring: so much so that, during the violent scene right at the end, I found myself squirming and fidgeting in my seat, wondering when it would all be over.One of this film's main faults is that it doesn't have much of a storyline to speak of and its whole premise (while admittedly based on a real-life incident) seemed rather ridiculous to me. Stupidly going for the bad guys (as is a habit of mine when watching movies) also didn't help, and I particularly detested all of the overt religiosity in the movie (such as all those highly offensive scenes of cross-kissing, and all those equally nauseating comments by the Americans about how God was on their side in the war (quite frankly, if God exists, I don't think he cares about stuff like this)). In addition to all of these other faults, the final scene is VILE (last long enough to get to it and you'll hopefully see what I mean).In summary, therefore, A HUNDRED MEGATON THERMONUCLEAR BOMB!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of Normandy, and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.Out there in that beach, Dog Green Sector, Omaha beach, hundreds if not thousands of courageous American soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent. Their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victory.Too many young Americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free. This source of American pride moves me in so many ways. We love the American heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors: the American soldiers.This movie, starring a great American actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of Captain Miller, 2nd Ranger, shows the American attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest American victories in world history. It is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for America and world freedom to win the most important war in history. I will always love America for that.Other fantastic American actors like Vin Diesel and Giovani Ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kind-hearted soldiers in the face of evil, showing all the heroism we can expect from an Army Ranger.All in all this movie is a must-see and it is worth to buy the DVD. The fantastic soundtrack and the emotional flag-waving at the end of the movie make your eyes to water-up. You will never forget this excellent Hollywood production and the wonderful story told will get you speechless for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg'S AWFUL "SPIN JOB" on NORMANDY VETS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the worst movie ever made about World War II and the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, Spielberg has taken the heroic story of the 5 Sullivan Brothers who lost their lives in the Pacific, renamed them Ryan, moved them to Europe, and turned them into cry-babies. Spielberg has said on TV that he never understood why America had to fight World War II to begin with, and this movie proves it. The infamous "first 20 minutes" -- was touted as a super-realistic hardline look at the horrors of combat. Hint: Look elsewhere, such as in Mel Gibson's outstandingly raw combat scenes in "We Were Soldiers." Spielberg's opening combat scenes are a dreadful special effects show, and any viewer involvement falls flat for lack of either character development or contact with Earth. When fighting a war, it's better to not send cowards or airheads to do a man's job. The same can be said for making movies about war. Spielberg ought to have evolved into a grown-up at his age, but so far he's just devoid of character and backbone. This is sadly reflected in this dreadful unpatriotic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I some times wonder if Spielberg is one of those contributors to modern anti-semitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy, so old-school outdated cinema style with all that long, soggy melodrama, those tell-tale "musical effects" or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie... this is funny because one can GUESS without looking at who's the director by just listening carefully 10-20 minutes into the movie that Spielberg is the director... it's literally that obvious. I am not sure if "Uncle Zoid" from that one Futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at Spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is, but that one episode summed it up perfectly. Anyhoo..... Unlike the Shoah cash-cow "Shindler's List" which was made with such severe historic digressions that even Shindler's actual real life family complained about it - in this movie Spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire US-viewer oriented genres of movies: feelgood American war heroes. Not just that, but in the finest way possible; as in a handful of guys take on half of Wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight... and the main aim of their heroic K/D ratio of 100:1 in the movie is... *US patriotism intensifies*... to save a private who's already advanced very far in the war, because Uncle Sam said enough of his family members died. Ugh... And while U-Boot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard, Spielberg took no notes what so ever. The same way how USA today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do, the same way does Spielberg make movies.So all that being said, if one is not as critical then the movie is "okay". Good enough entertainment if one closes an eye and does not think too hard. But it's eons away from other war movies that do not depict war the same way Die Hard depicts hostage situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the aftermath of D-Day, Tom Hanks and his platoon of soldiers are sent off on a glorified PR-mission into harm's way to "rescue" and bring home the last surviving member of the Ryan family.Steven Spielberg can be a truly great director, but Saving Private Ryan is an increasingly tiresome and nearly unwatchable trudge through war movie clichés. After the harrowing opening recreation, the film slides inexorably downhill into a rut from which it never emerges. For all of the heralding by critics and fans of what a great film this is, it is predictable, mind-numbing and finally butt-numbing.A minor history lesson. While it is true that in events where an entire generation of a family enlisted and all but one died, there were efforts to extract and return the soldier in question home. However, extraction often meant waiting for the soldier or his commanding officer(s) to be in contact and then make appropriate arrangements for said soldier to be removed as soon as possible. Try as I might, I can find no historic evidence that documents what happens in this film, in that an entire platoon of men are placed in constant life-threatening situations in order to extract a single private for a glorified PR stunt.Spielberg often has problems with conclusions, especially in his more serious endeavors. That is definitely the case here, which features a wraparound, which opens at Arlington Cemetery with the aged Ryan and concludes there as well. The entire segment is badly directed and heavy-handed.The script itself is almost ridiculously slight, particularly for a near 3-hour running time. The men in the platoon are all marching clichés reduced to types seen in a thousand other (and in many cases much better) war films. Each actor pretty much fastens in on one character trait and allows that to suffice for a performance. Hanks fares best as the everyman leader and Tom Sizemore is adequate as the second-in-command, but they have given very similar performances elsewhere. Worst performances come from Jeremy Davies, who overacts hysterically in the final third, and Edward Burns, who somehow manages to make his character supremely unlikable.For the duration of the film, it hits the same tedious notes. The men trod through the ugly war zone, one of them confides something personal and is then subsequently obliterated in an often painfully protracted geyser of gore. The platoon's slog resumes, someone else confides a personal story and then said person is annihilated shortly thereafter. Over and over again and again...until a handful remain to find their quarry. Given that their losses do not endear the survivors to their quarry, it comes as no surprise when they finally face Private Ryan (solidly played by Matt Damon), who is such a congenial, aw-shucks, Middle American nice guy, that not only are the surviving men immediately charmed by him, but when Ryan refuses to leave his post, our survivors defy their orders to extract him immediately and stand by him in the chaotic final onslaught.There is pretty much nothing in the way of surprise in the film and everything unfolds in a slow and tortuously predictable fashion. About the only surprise is how needlessly and relentlessly brutal Spielberg is with the violence. After the opening moments of horrific carnage, I think everyone gets the whole "war is hell" scenario. Unfortunately, Spielberg never ratchets back the violence - releasing free-flowing blood, gore and body parts at the camera.Worse, the film is incredibly ugly to look at. Many WW2 veterans recount the beauty of Europe during their service, yet the entire color palette of this film consists of mud brown, bleak greys and depressing blues (and of course dark red blood). Spielberg also over-utilizes the now too common place Shake-cam 4000, in which the camera jitters all over the place like its got palsy or is afflicted by St. Vitus's Dance, which I gather is supposed to provide a "you are there" authenticity, but instead generates motion sickness, migraines and frustration.A really tiresome and criminally overrated viewing experience. By the climax, when the elderly Ryan questions whether it was all worth it, you may well find yourself responding negatively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This (in my opinion) is the only film that captures the true nature of war. Films often glorify war. Saving Private Ryan exposes the beast for what it truly is. The first five minutes of the landings are the best example of the second World war for what it truly was. the sacrifice and the suffering that was felt by men on both sides and what the effects where on the survivors. As ever Hanks delivers a fantastic performance that is both believable and gripping. the supporting actors at first appear distant but the film creates a bond between the viewer and the men involved as we experience the same events as they do that exposes us to their incredible story. The film also stimulates a debate. Was it right for the lives of several men for the life of a last brother. Through this the film shows the true sacrifice that comes with war. Best war film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan (1998): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper: Superbly crafted war film about the value of a single human being. Three out of four brothers die in the war 1914 while the fourth was a paratrooper deemed lost. Private James Ryan is still alive and Tom Hanks is ordered to bring troops in to extreme danger to bring him home at the request of his mother. The first 25 minutes are horrifyingly realistic as distorted bodies pile up on the Omaha Beach. Director by Steven Spielberg details the reality of surviving an explosion only to discover that your legs are missing. This can easily play double billing with his Schindler's List. Tom Hanks delivers an excellent performance as Captain Miller who leads the mission and is committed to life itself. Matt Damon is well cast as James Ryan who makes a turn for the good of others. Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and Barry Pepper are also featured among the squadron. The problem is that most of these supporting roles are cardboard types that are always overshadowed by the two leads. Even the scene where an enemy is saved only to later gun one of them down. How likely is it for that same enemy to turn up again with someone set to avenge his act? Featuring some of the best war footage ever shot with a strong human story of havoc, heroism and the value of human life. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate WWII Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a Spielberg movie, such a Hollywood blockbuster, such a WWII drama, I can't even. All the cheesy dialogues, the sentimental scenes, the horror of the war, the pathetic American nationalism with the movie beginning and finishing with a take of the American flag, the old war Veteran speaking to the grave, all the possible war tropes (the nice guy who is afraid of killing, the highly moral doctor, the macho Vin Diesel, the Jew fighting against Germans, the rebel who doesn't follow the Captain's orders, and of course the heroic, brave Captain)... I've seen these a million times, though probably never as well put-together as in Saving Private Ryan. So I guess you could say that it is, among its kind, the best; even if I'm not a fan of that kind.The opening scene is a whole different story, though. The Normandy landing is quite masterly filmed, and it probably ranks among the best opening scenes ever (can't really think of any other opening scene as memorable). It's cruel, bloody, and impressive.The ending, on the other hand, really put me down. Everything was so cliché, and what's up with the Allied troops ending thanks to the last-minute, never-mentioned help of the Air force? Script writers, take note: NEVER let the plot be solved by an element that you never mentioned to the public. Nothing creaks the illusion of reality as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep in the war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, war movies have aroused great interest. Accordingly, a plethora of this sort of movies has invaded our cinemas. Maybe the two most popular war movies in recent years have been Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg, focused on the Normandy Landings, and Flags of our Fathers, directed by Clint Eastwood, focused on the battle of Iwo Jima (together with Letters from Iwo Jima, the Japanese view of the conflict, whose premiere in Spain will be held in few weeks). Both films show bloody scenes of fights and, as a result, the cruelty of the war. In addition, a large part of both films is focused on the miseries and attitudes towards death, danger and desperation of a small group of soldiers. Also common to both films is the fact that the main characters are actually antiheroes. The Spielberg's film takes place mostly in the battlefield and is perfectly linear. On the other hand, flashbacks are used in Flags of our Fathers in order to show both the war and the propaganda campaign undertaken by the main characters going across the United States. By virtue of this we can see a different drama in this film related to the feelings and problems of the soldiers when they come back home to undertake a mission they have not been trained for. Furthermore, we clearly identify with the leading actor in Saving Private Ryan (Tom Hanks). On the contrary, the three actors in Eastwood's film actually share the prominence. The strength of Saving Private Ryan lies in the intense representation of the war and it is a typical war film, maybe better than others, but a war film nevertheless. However, Flags of our Fathers is more complex. With his usual skill, Eastwood shows a combination of war and politics, death and propaganda.</fullReview>

It was a great movie that really had a great group of actors who put on such a great performance. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because the performances that were given as well as a good script and director. This is one for the history books and every time I watch this movie it makes me more proud to be an American. I appreciate the brave lives that were given to defend our country. I think it had a great beginning, middle, and end with an outstanding performance. I especially liked how the movie ended with Private Ryan at the grave of his fellow soldier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything in this movie was great, the camera work, special effects and the scripts. The most gruesome scene is by far the opening beach assault scene in the movie as it was very realistic,action packed and made your stomach turn. It's characters like Pvt.Jackson that movies like this great especially with his bible quoting and inch perfect shots. The other most significant character in the movie for me is Captain Miller. Captain Miler, the school teacher is perhaps one of the most inspiring people for me personally. His leadership, awareness and overall calmness is amazing. This is perhaps Spielberg's best ever movie(debatable) and it will always be in my personnel top 10 because of its realism and one of its main themes, the basis of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan is the quintessential war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without question Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie of all time. It is also credited for renewing worldwide interest in World War II and also renewed popularity with old and new movies, TV shows, and video games. Saving Private Ryan set the bar very high for all war movies since its release. Steven Spielberg is a great director and Saving Private Ryan is easily one of his best movies of all time. The all star cast is fantastic.Saving Private Ryan starts with a World War II veteran bringing his family to the American cemetery at Normandy when he is overcome with emotion when visiting the graves of fellow soldiers who he served with. The film then flashes back to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks in one of his best roles) leads the 2nd Ranger Battalion onto Omaha Beach to secure the beach and overcome the German defense amidst heavy casualties. While the opening 25 minute scene is unforgettable and excellently choreographed, this scene is a perfect depiction of the brutality of the horrors of war. It is realistically graphic and in no way glamorizes nor glorifies war unlike other movies.Meanwhile in Washington D.C. at the U.S. War Department, correspondence is being prepared to send to the various families notifying them of the loss of their loved ones during the war. In one of the saddest scenes of the movie in which you can't help but shed a tear, Mrs Ryan receives three letters on the same day notifying her that three of her sons were killed in action. A decision is made for the fourth son, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), to be located and sent home immediately.The mission to find Private Ryan is handed to Captain Miller and his squad which includes his second in command Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the cynical machine gunner Private Rieben (Edward Burns), Jewish soldier Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the deeply religious sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), medic Private Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Italian-American soldier Private Carparzo (Vin Diesel in an early role), and a skilled translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has not seen combat and finds himself bumbling throughout the mission and also resented by most of the squad members. The squad members find themselves questioning their mission to find one soldier and bring him home, but continue in their quest to locate Private Ryan as well as battling through numerous encounters with the German Army and confusion reigns as to whether Private Ryan is missing or presumably killed in action.The screenplay by Robert Rodat is excellent and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski perfectly captures the desaturated colour imagery of World War II. Steven Spielberg's eye for detail as well as the ability to bring out the emotional side of viewers is highly admirable. The cast, particularly Tom Hanks as Captain Miller as an everyman thrust into action as the leader of men is excellent and he makes this role his own. Matt Damon as the young Private James Ryan must also be highly commended. The rest of the cast such as Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies shine in their respective outstanding roles.Also in the all star cast, Dennis Farina (a well known character actor who sadly passed away in 2013), Paul Giamatti (another character actor known for comedic roles), Bryan Cranston (before his famous role as Walter White in Breaking Bad), and Ted Danson (best known for TV shows Cheers and Becker) pop up in small roles in Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is one of the few emotionally powerful movies that is capable of making grown men shed a tear, despite many unwilling to openly admit it. There are a few scenes, particularly the ending that evoke the emotional side of many viewers. Saving Private Ryan deserved its widespread critical acclaim and success at the box office. It also garnered numerous awards and Steven Spielberg was a well deserved winner, but in a complete travesty was unfairly robbed of the 1998 Best Picture Academy Award. Why Saving Private Ryan missed out on the Best Picture Academy Award I'll never know.Saving Private Ryan exhibits Steven Spielberg's finest movie to date, and this is certainly a very memorable movie for Tom Hanks. I take my hat off to Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their fantastic work in this movie. A lot of people say that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies of all time due to its realistic depiction of the horrors of World War II. I wholeheartedly agree that it truly deserves its recognition as the best war movie of all time, and rightfully so.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still continues to amaze me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have proved many times that they have a great deep respect and understanding of war and the ones who fight on either side, and this along with Band of Brothers is probably the best on screen portrayal of war that I've seen personally.The opening sequence of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the rest of the Army Rangers landing on Omaha Beach is one of the most jaw dropping openings ever put into film. I still remember my reaction to the opening scene when I first watched this and I was literally stunned when they show the soldiers in the boats immediately getting struck by bullets the moment the doors open up. The rest of the battle sequences are filmed with so much authentic realism and are never seem glorified in the slightest, and the final battle is one of the most intense, nail biting battle sequences I've ever seen. A lot of detail was put into the locations and the American and German Army uniforms and tanks. The sound design and the camera movements by Spielberg make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. This is one of those times where shaky cam can be used with skill, given that it's set in the middle of a war zone.Story wise, it's very well done. Captain Miller and his men are sent deep into German occupied Normandy to look for Private James Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division after his 3 brothers are killed in combat elsewhere in the war, and they question why they should even bother going along with it. Up until you meet James Ryan and get to know him, the movie does a good job of posing the question: "Why should we sacrifice all these lives for just one man?" I don't know the answer to that question, but it seems to me that when they meet him at the final act, they see what kind of person he is and they decide he's worth saving and literally go through hell to ensure his safety.As for the cast/characters, each character gets their own moment to shine even if it's not that long. This is one of Tom Hanks' best performances, and the scene where he breaks down after losing Wade shows you how great of an actor this guy is. Matt Damon is the best actor they could've chosen as Private James Ryan even if he's not in it that much, Edward Burns' character gets on my nerves a bit on how big of an a-hole he is until the end when he decides to help Private Ryan in the end. Tom Sizemore is really funny, Giovanni Ribisi and Barry Pepper are very good in their parts. As is Vin Diesel surprisingly. As for Upham (Jeremy Davies), a lot of people hate his character since he didn't rescue Mellish from being stabbed in the chest by a German soldier, and while I do agree that he should've helped at the same time I can't really blame him for being scared the way he was. I've been in the National Guard for the last two years, though I've never been in combat but I can tell you that not everybody is going to look and act like the Terminator when they're put into a life threatening situation. Some people just can't deal with that. Plus I found it pretty satisfying when he shoots the same German soldier in the end not only for Mellish but also in response to shooting Captain Miller.And another thing I've appreciated is how the movie doesn't portray the Germans as monsters. The story is told from an American perspective and don't really focus on the German side on the war and even though there were some who truly believed in Nazism, most of the Germans were just human beings like you and I. They were just doing what they were told, fighting for their country, family and fellow comrades.Even though a lot of directors have done this with their movies, Spielberg has this cool way of pulling all these familiar faces out of thin air into his movies even if it's for a brief amount of time: Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad is in here (as a fan of the show I get all giddy whenever he's on screen), Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dale Dye, Leland Orser, the late Dennis Farina and fans of Joss Whedon's "Firefly" will pleased to see Nathan Fillion in this movie even if it's only for about 3 minutes.In the end, this is one of my all time favorite movies and probably my favorite war film by far. It has a well executed story, well realized characters, intense battle scenes, a great musical score by the one and only John Williams, respect for the historical setting and finally the part where Captain Miller says to Private Ryan, "Earn this" chokes me up every time I watch it. Spielberg has done great work before and after he made this movie but he really outdoes himself with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an instant American war epic. Directed by Steven Spielberg and deserving of its critical acclaim. The opening 27 minutes is a graphic and realistic depiction of the assault at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. An intensive and prolonged sequence featuring the brutality of combat. Captain John Miller(Tom Hanks)leads a Ranger Battalion ashore with intent of securing a beachhead. Graphic and intense images not for the faint of heart. Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall assigns Cpt. Miller and a select squad of six plus an interpretor to search for a paratrooper, Private James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon),the last surviving brother of four that have entered the war. At times Miller's squad wants to balk on the search, but pull together not in respect for Ryan, but Miller.This movie was written by Robert Rodat and features a musical score by the acclaimed John Williams. Cinematography is more than outstanding and features amazing camera positioning. There is an all-star cast that also features: Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Paul Giamatti, Adam Goldberg, Jeremy Davies, Ted Danson and Dennis Farina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great War Movie and a Worthy Tribute to the American Soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three brothers have been killed in the line of duty, all within days of each other. The fourth brother is somewhere in Normandy. Orders come from the highest level to bring him home. Improbable as the scenario may be, this provides the setup for one of the best war movies ever made.First off, Saving Private Ryan is one of the most realistic portrayals of combat I've ever seen. It pulls no punches when it comes to the sheer brutality of war. The opening assault on Omaha Beach was possibly the bloodiest sequence filmed up to that time, and the subsequent engagements have no shortage of carnage either. But this is no splatterfest; while it doesn't shy away from the blood and gore, it doesn't dwell on them either. The violence is here because that's what war is like, not for shock value.The same approach is taken with the numerous death scenes. When a member of the team is killed, the movie doesn't just move on and say "Oh well." It makes you feel for the deceased, and for his comrades. Yet it never falls to the level of melodrama. There are no half-baked dying speeches, nothing about how he was supporting six kids who will now be left on the street (and yes, I have seen that line used, although it was in the context of a mining collapse.) Saving Private Ryan also deals with the thoughts and emotions of ordinary men thrust into war. The men of the Second Rangers, battle hardened though they may be, are not career soldiers. They answered the call of duty, but more than anything else, they just want the war to end so they can go home alive. Every time Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) loses a man, he consoles himself that one life was given so that two or three or ten could be saved, that the war is bigger than one man. But this time, the mission is about one man; a man they can't even be sure is still alive. It is a testament to these men's courage and sense of duty that they continue on a dangerous mission that few of them believe in.As for Captain Miller, he is quite likely Hank's best role since Forrest Gump. He's quiet and reserved- to the point that there's a $300 prize for guessing his hometown- but he knows what he's doing and cares about the men under his command. He is ever the example for the men, never complaining or expressing doubts in front of the men. He praises them when they do well, tells it to them in no uncertain terms when they screw up, and does whatever he has to to keep them focused on their mission, even if deep down he thinks the whole thing is Fubar. And when he's given the choice between returning to headquarters, his objective achieved, or risking everything to make a stand against long odds, he makes the right decision.And in the end, when the now aged James Ryan stands over the graves of the men who died to save him, it was one of the most moving, uplifting cinematic experiences I've had. Spielberg and Hanks have created not only a gripping war film, but a fitting tribute to the American soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Does It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years after winning his first Oscar for his best movie (Schindler's List) Spielberg wins his second Best Directing Oscar for his next war epic, Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest war movie of all time. In my opinion, this is tied with Apocalypse Now as the best. Both are fantastic war movies, but they're too different to really pick which is better. But I do agree when people say this should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. My favourite movie of the year was American History X, but Saving Private Ryan was a better piece of film. The movie that beat Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love, was a great and deserving flick, but not as deserving as this.This movie has a very simple concept, a war Captain (Hanks) leads a group of eight soldiers in the Normandy invasion during the Second World War to rescue a Private Ryan (Damon) and bring him back to his mother. The closer the group gets, the deadlier the mission becomes with the men dying one by one. Why are eight men risking their lives just to save one? Best war movie or not, this is the most realistic, bar none. The camera is shaky and distorted to capture the most realistic experience possible. Even more realistic than Schindler's List. So much that it looks like actual found footage. That is what makes the movie so brilliant, and so disturbing. The deadlier the mission becomes, the more exciting the movie gets. A fascinating tale of courage and heroism, the end result will leave you clapping with joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan's genre changing depiction of battle means that thinly drawn narrative and characterisation is unimportant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is technically excellent, it achieved what very few films do ? it set a new benchmark. The film's harsh aesthetic and desaturated colour palette has been emulated many times, Ryan's influence can be seen in films from We Were Soldiers (2002) and Rambo (2008) to Black Hawk Down (2001) and Fury (2014). Although there have been some decent efforts, I am yet to see a film that equals let alone surpasses the beginning 25 minutes, the final battle in the fictional French town of Ramelle and everything in between.The film follows the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the salient characters of which including Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), the affable yet authoritative leader; Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the platoon's second in command; Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), a stylishly ultra- accurate, cross kissing sniper from the bible belt; Private Reiben (Edward Burns), an incendiary man from Brooklyn; Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), a Jew who relishes informing German captives of his heritage and T4 Grade Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies), a very timid man who proves wholly unsuited to war. The men's mission is to locate and send home Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) on the compassionate orders of Chief of Staff George Marshall, who has been informed that Ryan's three brothers have all died in combat, their mother receiving the three telegrams simultaneously.'You wanna explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?' says the argumentative Private Reiben. He addresses what I'm sure many viewers were wondering ? is this premise plausible? Although inspired by and probably keen to emulate Lincoln's Bixby letter, would George Marshall have really possessed such compassion during a state of total war? It's interesting to note that screenwriter Robert Rodat developed the idea after reading a monument in Putney Corners, New Hampshire that listed the names of eight brothers who died during the American Civil War.Unlike Brad Pitt in the recent Fury, Tom Hanks gives the performance of an everyday man, a middle-class secondary school teacher thrust into an extraordinary situation. Hank's character Captain Miller reminds you of what is now the unthinkable idea of conscription, reminds you of how civilians with little or no prior interest, ability or training in the army were mobilised to kill and conquer. There's not much to be found outside of Captain Miller in terms of characterisation however, Miller's men are quite flat and unremarkable, apart from Private Jackson, whose ultra-accuracy is displayed with a stylish flair that's out of character in a film whose violence is appropriately ugly. Jackson is also a good ol' boy, a self-righteous bible spouting stock character who was recently emulated by Shia LaBeouf as 'Boyd 'Bible' Swan' in Fury.What I also found slightly troubling was the construction of the Germans, it was somewhat crude. Of the countless German troops we see in the film, the only one that is given any depth, 'Steamboat Willie' (Joerg Stadler), is shown to be a horribly callous backstabber; although, considering the context of total war, some may argue that he was just a soldier doing his duty. The narrative arcs of 'Willie' and Upham (the coward of the platoon) intertwine, climaxing in a scene that I think is ethically dubious.Despite both narrative and character development being somewhat thinly drawn, they're not that bad and, crucially, not the centre of the film. The film's great accomplishment lies in its seminal depiction of warfare. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is to be commended for his raw, grisly aesthetic and his perfectly judged use of erratic camera movement, a style that has been messily emulated to nausea-inducing effect far too many times.Like many others have, I could praise endlessly the new level of gripping realist cinema that Ryan introduced to viewers; however almost all of this commendation is being delivered by people who have never experienced battle. How do we know what a battle truly looks and feels like? The majority of what I witnessed seemed realistic to me, but I can't offer solid corroboration as I stepped foot on Omaha Beach 70 years too late. Surely the ultimate endorsement and affirmation for Saving Private Ryan's authenticity is from the people who have experienced war.Written in the Florida Times Union on 15th August 1998 was an account of D-Day veterans 'enduring' Saving Private Ryan. This included Bill Faust, 78, who was accompanied in the theatre by only one other as the rest of his North Florida D-Day veterans' group walked out - 'I should have never gone to see that damn movie,' Faust said, 'In my mind, most of the details of D-Day were gone; all this did was bring them back? it's better to keep them tucked away where they don't bother you.'The article continues ? 'Vietnam veteran Ed Kelly, 57, left before the opening scene was over - "I just couldn't handle it" Kelly said. "The kid holding his guts; I had seen that in Vietnam. That was it for me. I got up and walked out. It was the closest thing to the horrors of real combat that I have ever seen.'There was also Jerry Markham, 79, who walked out of the theatre 'impressed and depressed, amazed but saddened by the realism of the sights and sounds, especially the instant deaths after the landing craft ramps were lowered.' Markham was a Navy chief petty officer on a demolitions team on D-Day and saw his commanding officer die this way - 'That scene broke me up... that was how it happened. Bodies were flying everywhere? I wouldn't recommend it for young children, but anyone 14, 15 or older should see it? they should start learning about how horrible war is.' I think all of this speaks volumes for Saving Private Ryan's credibility.90%(for the full travel article, please visit www.hawkensian.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great war movie! Saw it listed as a documentary which it is not. Based on a small kernel of truth, 90% of the movie is fiction. (There was no trek across France nor any battles to retrieve Niland - the real Pvt. Ryan.)Don't get me wrong. I am not complaining. But fiction is fiction, usually with a hefty dose of drama. And Ton Hanks' portrayal of the Captain in charge of the group sent to find and bring Ryan back is great. All the supporting cast is also great. The action scenes are superb. I particularly liked the scenes of the armour. (Halftracks, tanks, etc.) However this is still a work of fiction. To call it a documentary does a dis-service to film-makers and servicemen alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly after the invasion of Normandy, a small group of soldiers is ordered to locate and rescue a paratrooper, Private Ryan, whose brothers were all killed in action during the war. This is the story of a group of soldiers who embark on a perilous journey to save the youngest brother of the Ryan family from Iowa. After the U.S. Army find out that all but one brother have perished during the war they order Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, and his squad to locate and bring Private James Francis Ryan, played by Matt Damon, to safety. Miller's group believes in following orders but at what expense. The star-studded cast includes Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Reiben, Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham, Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo, Adam Goldberg as Private Mellish, Barry Pepper as Private Jackson, and Giovanni Ribisi as Medic Wade.The gunfire from the beach piercing the helmets and bodies of the soldiers on the launches occurs immediately as the launch opens. Descending from the launch, soldiers were drowning while attempting to reach the beach. The scenes move quickly; the film speed and the movement were as if you were in the middle of the action. This movie is filled with action, and Miller's squad has many obstacles to overcome while searching for Ryan, after he became separated from his squad while jumping into France during the invasion. This exhausting journey leaves the soldiers feeling hopeless at times and wanting to give up the search. They are torn between their loyalties to their duty and what they feel is right. After receiving some information on a possible location for Ryan, the squad is walking through a field. Every footstep is heard despite the conversations of the soldiers. Reiben was complaining about the mission and asking the captain how he complains. Miller reminds Reiben of the chain-of-command and procedures. Miller listens to the conversations and interjects at time reminding his men about duty. The soldiers come upon a small town, hearing gunfire in the distance and mortar rounds; they approach the dilapidated building, cautiously watching for German soldiers. A family in one of the buildings wants the soldiers to take his children with them; Miller informs his men they cannot take the children. All the while Upham is translating to the parents they cannot take the children. Caparzo, disobeying his captain, takes a small girl from her father in an attempt to assist with getting her to safety.Next, you see Caparzo laying in the street bleeding at the hands of a German sniper. The girl runs to her father and begins to yell at him and slapping him in his face. Caparzo is trying to get up, he removes a letter from his vest, and Wade adamantly instructed Caparzo to stay still.

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved this movie. Great acting and a great story. A powerful and realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. Spielberg does an amazing job with this movie. Although there is a lot of blood and guts, it makes it more real. Tom Hanks is one of today's great actors. He did an amazing job in the movie. The start of the movie is hard to watch at times. However it makes it so real and puts you in the place of the soldiers. The special affects and sound make the movie seem more real too. Saving Private Ryan goes beyond technical dazzlement to put a new, indelibly terrible face on war. It makes you realize what they went though for our freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real heroes in the real hell of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it is possible to make a majestic film about a hellish war Steven Spielberg has done so. With Saving Private Ryan Spielberg beautifully blends the arts of filmmaking and storytelling. With such an accomplished director at the helm it is no surprise that this is such a technically proficient film, that it looks so spectacular, so real. But this film is so much more than the stunning, often horrifying, visuals. This is a film with a magnificent, inspiring story. And Spielberg tells that story so well, taking you through the emotional wringer. Tom Hanks leads an outstanding cast, Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is breathtaking, John Williams provides a powerful and at times haunting score. And credit must also go to screenwriter Robert Rodat whose story is so incredibly compelling. So many people contributing so brilliantly to an absolutely fascinating film. Everyone did their part and Spielberg put all the pieces together perfectly.The film begins on D-Day with the Normandy invasion which of course could be an entire film in and of itself. This sequence is unrelenting, Spielberg sparing nothing in his depiction of the inconceivable violence on Omaha Beach. Never has any film so brutally illustrated that war is indeed hell. Thousands of men bravely face what for so many must seem to be a certain death. As the bodies fall and blood turns the sea red Captain John Miller continues to push his company forward. They make a critical breakthrough but at such cost. Miller, and we, look down at the carnage below on the beach. So many men lay there, having made the ultimate sacrifice. The camera focuses in on one of the dead, on his backpack we see the name: S. Ryan. And we know that this film, even as it tells the tale of a conflict which engulfed the whole world, is going to tell a very personal story.The Ryan we see lying on the beach is one of three Ryan brothers killed in action. A fourth Ryan brother, James, is missing in action having parachuted behind German lines. From Washington comes a very unusual, but very clear order. Captain John Miller is to find James Ryan. And send him home. Miller assembles a small unit from his company. Eight men will go out into the French countryside, still occupied by Germans mind you, to find and save Private Ryan. Eight men will risk their lives to save one. Suffice to say not all of the eight are particularly happy with this assignment. But orders are orders and off the men go, into the great unknown. No simple mission this. Danger lurks at every turn. Spielberg ratchets up the tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat. You care so much about these men because Spielberg, certainly with a great assist from screenwriter Rodat, has done such a fine job of allowing you to know them. These characters come fully formed. You feel you know them, really understand them, almost from the moment you first meet them. So many different personalities in the group. Credit of course must go to the actors portraying the squad, the performers bring these soldiers brilliantly to life. Hanks is the star, the leader, and he is excellent. But the other actors match him stride for stride. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi and Jeremy Davies...none put a foot wrong. An amazing cast which does justice to an amazing story.It is the story which really sets this film apart. It is a film about war but really it is a film about one man. But maybe that one man is not Private Ryan. Ryan plays his part but is this story really about Captain Miller? An ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation. A leader of men, doing his duty. Doing whatever is necessary to get his men, and himself, home. Hanks does such a terrific job portraying this man who remains an enigma even to his own men. Sometimes you get the sense he is an enigma to himself. He has lost the sense of who he is, or at least who he used to be. War will do that to you. The worldwide conflict is ultimately fought by individual men. And Spielberg allows you to get to know some of these men. Ryan and Miller. And Horvath, Reiben, Jackson, Mellish, Caparzo, Wade and Upham. Each has his own story to tell. And seeing each of their stories play out takes us back to the film's opening, to Omaha Beach. So many men died there. No film can tell every one of their stories. But with this film Spielberg has honored them all. A film of staggering scope and awesome power but with a personal touch. That Saving Private Ryan did not win the Best Picture Oscar is sad, quite frankly absurd. But honoring the film is not really important. Honoring the men who died so that we may be free is what really matters. And this film does just that.</fullReview>

I guess that is what makes a great actor, they tend to experience or act out very well real emotions while making a film.The ugly reality of war is seen throughout the movie and is heart-pounding action during those scenes.The ending of this film will bring a grown man to tears... in fact, anyone to tears that has a heart.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review of Saving Private RyanThe film Saving Private Ryan (1998) is a masterful period piece on the life of a select group of American soldiers during and shortly after the Normandy invasion in World War II. The film's plot is based on a small force of soldiers assigned to go behind enemy lines to find and bring home a young soldier whose family has lost all of their other sons to the war effort. Their interpersonal conflicts, thoughts, and physical efforts to fulfill this duty provide a gripping emotional and action packed film. The theme revolves around the sacrifices of men during war to accomplish difficult if not seemingly impossible assignments and goals. The viewer of this film experiences the personal point of view of the main character Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) during this battle and assignment. We see a range of emotional and physical acts of courage, strength, and fear that each soldier exhibits as he battles toward the front lines. Since the majority of viewers did not take part in this war, the film brings to light many of the horrors of war along with the exceptional responses humans are capable of producing during such times. The men that fought this fight had to be overwhelmed and horrified to watch their comrades die as well as for the majority experiencing killing for the first time. Spielberg's directing and the acting of the main actors relay the realism, emotions, and fears of war to the audience. Director Steven Spielberg creates an exciting adventure film with the use of different cameras, angles, and points of view. The use of the flashback point of view of Pt. Ryan (Matt Damon) from the initial scene in the cemetery throughout the film is a pivotal technique for continuity and emotional impact. The sound effects and surround sound evoke a strong and emotional response by adding realism. The lead characters Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Pt. Reiben (Edward Burns), Pt. Jackson (Barry Pepper), Pt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) all delivered believable performances with examples of the varying personalities any group under extremely trying circumstances would exhibit. Captain Miller is the lead character commanding his team through many difficult obstacles. This team had not only enemies to fight but at times each other. The interplay between the characters adds interest and depth to this film again revealing the theme of sacrifice as each character struggles with the amount of sacrifice he is willing to make to complete the assignment of saving Pt Ryan. Tom Hanks again progresses in his acting depth by taking on an intensely dramatic role. His performance is an excellent mix of intensity, frustration, and caring that will mark this piece as one of his best thus far. Saving Private Ryan is a fictional piece but based on true events from WWII where three sons in one family were killed within a one week period. The United States war department then sent a group of soldiers to try and find a fourth son before he too was killed. Post WWII, the Fighting Sullivans (1944) was another film in a similar theme based on the true story of five brothers all dying when their battleship the U.S. Juneau sank (www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq72-1.htm) The director and actors brought realism to this story and the entire film. Spielberg and Hanks along with the rest of the cast draw on skill and emotions to reveal the core of human strength in times of sacrifice and war in Saving Private Ryan. While the film is long, almost three hours, it is well worth the viewing and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks' best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made of the emotional impact and the excellent shooting scenes. The most emotional scene is the very beginning because of D-Day and the massive amount of casualties of war. The movie stars Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller who unfortunately did not win an Oscar for this movie when he really should have won, director Steven Spielberg has crafted his best movie since his first Oscar winning turn since his 1993 holocaust movie Schindler's List. Also in the movie there were a lot of other good performances from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel. This movie goes on a par with war film classics such as Black Hawk Down, Patton, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Devil's Brigade, and 633 Squadron. Another reason why this movie was great is because the shooting scenes looked so realistic, This is a triumph that is the best movie of 1998.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This Ryan better be worth it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence, a soldier's-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent, gory, visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable, bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets, limbs blown off, entrails spilling out, and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And, when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach, the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of "Saving Private Ryan" unbearable.It's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), a hero and survivor of the Omaha Beach battle, is chosen to lead the team of eight men whose goal is, in Miller's words, like finding "a needle in a stack of needles." His hand- picked team includes six men who have served with him throughout the war. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. These are a cast of characters who are unforgettable, and the film takes the time to flesh them out, and let the audience interact with them in their journey to find Ryan."Saving Private Ryan" is a powerful experience. I'm sure a lot of people will weep during it. Spielberg knows how to make audiences weep. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.The film's central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movie's shocking and unforgettable images, "Saving Private Ryan" offers a singular motion picture experience.</fullReview>

The D-Day landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever. It is unforgettable. The movie is bookended with heart stopping war action. The final battle is just as epic. The hand to hand fight with Private Mellish is devastating. The goal doesn't have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which Spielberg often likes to inject. The only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a powerful and dark film about a group of U.S. soldiers going behind enemy lines to try to locate a missing paratrooper, whose brothers have been killed in action.This film explicitly depicts the horror and consequences of war: bloodshed, fallen comrades, fierce battles and destroyed cities. Steven Spielberg's direction made this a fast-paced movie with nonstop action and suspense and superb acting, helped by an eerie music score by John Williams. As in other war movies, just the parts where the two opposing sides hunt and battle each other to the death are heart-pounding.This is one of those movies that are too long and complex to summarize all in one review. However, I can say that this movie is not for everybody, as many might get disturbed with the explicit and graphic war-violence scenes. Those who don't find the violence and enjoys high drama, action and a story based on a historical context will find this an entertaining feature.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A turn in the war movie history, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a great war film, and, as I have already said before, again and again, there will be a BEFORE and AFTER SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, speaking of visual grammar, hard boiled and realistic at the most battle sequences. Any movie made after this feature, any movie around the world: Russian, Korean, British, any movie was inspired by this one. But besides this side PRIVATE RYAN remains very classical in the meaning. You find here the good US soldiers vs the ugly German ones. OK, US troopers saved us, the french, but in war there is not good soldiers and evil ones. The scheme is more complex. I prefer the TV show made several years after PRIVATE RYAN: BAND OF BROTHERS, more accurate in the meaning, where we watch for instance GI's shooting German soldiers who surrender. In PRIVATE RYAN, we don't see this, as far as I remember. Even just after the "meat chopper" Utah Beach landing, when only one percent of US troopers reached the "beach hotel", I don't remember a sequence where those same soldiers shoot German ones who surrender. And this actually happened. Anyone who survived the Omaha Beach hell would have done the same. And me first!!Althoug some days after, in the middle of the woodland fights, in the deep Normandy countryside, the same scene would not have been less understandable. In resume, PRIVATE RYAN remains a great film, but I prefer THE VICTORS, a very different movie, yes. But that's the way it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Erwin Rommel is hardly the one to blame for mistakes made by the Nazi's in the assumption that Normandy would be to blame for the landing there rather than at the Pas de Calais; that was the one thing that Ike Eisenhower and the command staff should receive great credit for all they did to deceive Hitler. Rommel is still characterized as the one of two geniuses in the Wehrmacht (the other being von Runstedt and his development of the Blitzkreig which was so successful in France and the beginnings of the fatal mistake of invading the Soviet Union. In fact, Rommel was convinced that just as in the Salerno invasion, the troops would come ashore in Normandy, and in so believing, he vastly made the invasion more deadly by increasing Normandy Beach hazards and in flooding the landing spots for airborne/glider landings. And this is a great film in spite of the fact that Tom Hanks simply has to play the very role of the great Hero, General Norman Cota, the eldest American on Omaha Beach and the leader of the breakout with such brave leadership and by using the rarely used Bangalore torpedoes to shatter the second strand of barbed wire and leading the troops to great valor with his leadership. My only regret about the film was the failure to credit General Cota somehow in the breakthrough to the murderous machine gun fire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a film best appreciated by the action scene enthusiast. Flawless detail and fantastic direction- particularly in the notorious opening scene- combine to reach a superb portrayal of World War 2's Normandy landing. Normally, I wouldn't enthuse with action scenes, but in this film they are as simultaneously delicate and brutal as an audience could wish for.Other than that, the film is one dimensional. There is no real storyline. It would not be a spoiler to summarise the plot as; 'boy's brothers die, men go to find him' because that the entire progression of a 3 hour film. Without the acting of Tom Hanks, who just about propels the plot into something worthwhile. But even after Mr Hanks, you are left at the end with the feeling that you have missed a none existent development in a film that could do with one.Not the film of a motion picture aficionado. Yet a film not to be missed, despite its limitations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg To the question "What is your favorite movie or what movie you have seen many times?" The first movie, title which comes up to my mind is Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. The movie won 5 Oskar. It is the best movie about Second World War which was shooting by American Cinematography. I saw SPR (Saving Private Ryan) on TV. The cable TV which we had back home was translating a lot of International movies. American movies are one of the best, the whole world knows about American movies. Big budgets, filming skills and actors are best in America. By those criteria SPR caught my attention and dipped me into the atmosphere of bloody war. The film is about American soldiers' encounter with German forces at the coast line during the first day of D-Day. American army organized with Allies a massive landing on the Normandy beach (North France). Also thousands of paratroopers landed into deep into center of France. The story begins with scene where Private Ryan shown as already old man, who is walking with his family at soldiers' cemetery. Ryan came to honor the memory to the significant person of his life, the person who saved his life, the price which was the dead life of whole rescue group. The interesting part begins after first scene. The picture quickly changes from silent soldiers' cemetery, where the grass is green; sky is blue, and people wearing bright colored cloth to the Normandy beach. In 1944th before year of victory, France was still occupied and controlled by German-Nazi army. Germans built a massive defensive line along all France beach territory. Defenders set up a big number of bunkers and fences on the beach. All that picture of war was presented in high quality. Massacre begins with lending American troops to the beach where Germans starts to shoot them. American forces loses thousands of people under the machine-gun fire during the first hours of landing on Omaha beach that how was named that sector. The main actors are identified at the moment when camera showing American troopers sailing to the beach and that entire scene follows Captain Miller's squad.</fullReview>

The decision to split the map at the International Date line wasn't officially made until the National Geographic Society decreed it in 1988.When the soldiers are at the seawall during the D-Day scene Miller explains to Horvath that Dog 1 exit is to the west. Right after that, the soldier behind Miller with the BAR leans up on him and shouts "they're killing us because we don't have chance and that ain't fair".

Whose life is worth more, they wonder, that one of their fighting men or a desperate enemy of the results. "Saving Private Ryan" shows a new impression in the second World War, and illustrates how the soldiers were eaten up the mental images of decisions, the sense of justice and balance. Policy does not matter, it's a story about the soldiers and just about them, with all their strengths, fears and weaknesses, but each with his own.

They seemed to have the right emotions and I could tell each and every single character personality. But somewhat, I have lots of questions. I have lots to ask, but here's one: How was it possible that Ryan's Mother managed to get contact of her son's deaths in only days after they died? How did they even know Sean, Peter or Daniel Ryan died in the first place? Many other plot holes I didn't get, so I gave this film a 9/10. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

Most of the characters also have a background, like Miller who is a teacher before being dragged into the war.All in all, the movie is terrific and I give it a full 10/10, one of Spielberg's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really puts you in the scene of the D-Day beaches, obviously with a amazing director such as Steven Spielberg who has directed my favourite films; it was bound to be good; but it really surprised me by how good it actually was. The acting was great; but with actors such as Tom Hanks and Matt Damon I expected none the less. This film is very emotional as it makes you stop and think about the soldiers that died in D-day; It also has sad parts in it when friends die e.c.t. This film has amazingly realistic special effects and make up yet is quite gory. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys war/action films 10/10 times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, and deals with a questionable concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production of this movie is epic. It's hard to believe that it was made on 70 million dollars, but that was 15 years ago. The story is unusual in that US military goes out of its way to extricate a certain private Ryan from the battle field at any cost because his family has lost 3 brothers to war already. It sends in a squad of infantry men into Normandy to find and save private Ryan. While the intent is noble, the wisdom doesn't make much sense. If Ryan dies, that's only one man, but the entire squadron is under danger of losing their lives in the attempt.This movie could have been 30 - 60 minutes shorter, and would have been better focused. Some of the battle ground scenes are the most realistic ever caught on film.The movie leaves you feeling somewhat empty because of the foolish nature of the war, and a human drama that at its core doesn't make much sense. Like in lifeguard course we learn that if the rescue is too dangerous, it's OK to abandon rescue because one dead person is better than a two dead people. The military's decision in this movie totally goes against this wisdom.You be the judge of the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, but just short of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how it has taken me almost 15 years to watch Saving Private Ryan. Somehow I guess I just never got round to it. Well I finally did and was left with mixed feelings.Far more experienced movie critics and war experts than me have extolled the opening scene. So there's little more that I can add. It's power to shock and sadden surpasses almost anything I've seen before it and for that alone the film has earned its place in movie history.Of course the downside is that if it surpassed so much before it, then it inevitably also surpassed the 100 or so minutes that followed it. I'll forgive that though. Ultimately in the story of the Normandy beach landings, the landings were the beginning and so although it's not perfect from a movie perspective, it's the only way to tell it. I did though find much of the rest of SPR remarkably standard. Yes the acting was excellent. However the characters were distinct caricatures. The bitter Jew, the loyal lieutenant, the brash New Yorker and the good guy medic. They were all finely portrayed but their characters brought nothing new to the screen. It was only Jeremy Davies' interpreter who could have come from superior war films such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket (or even the vastly different but more cerebral The Thin Red Line, which SPR overshadowed).My other issue is the portrayal of those damn Germans. Inglourious Bastards revels in it's over the top portrait of just about every German during WWII being Satan's sidekick. However that film has its tongue firmly in cheek. SPR does not and the German soldier who is let free by Tom Hanks' super hero captain ("he'll be picked up soon enough"), and then returns as the face of the enemy is pure Hollywood cliché.Don't get me wrong, SPR was a fine film. The opening is shocking and the remainder is thoroughly enjoyable. The caricatures which prevented it from matching the greats also offer a large degree of comfort. They allow us to feel like we know all these characters and emphasise with them immediately, with little effort. Spielberg paints by numbers in the last battle scene though, it being all too predictable to fully believe any battle in any war ever quite happened like that. It's for this reason that in the context of the great war films (or the few I've seen to date), I'd say it falls a little short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect film, for those who want to watch a war/action film that shows the reality of war during world war 2. An easy to follow, but still interesting plot leads no viewers confused or bored throughout. The director was able to capture the violence and brutality of the film in the first 15 min of the film, and is able to continue those themes. Tom Hanks' performance adds the the realism of the characters, making them seem more like real people rather than Hollywood action heroes, but adding in an theme of unity/band between the squad. Overall it is a film great for understanding the horrors of war, and for its action. However the plot does seem quite linear and is not very complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A war film unparalleled in almost every respect, Saving Private Ryan is framed by a present-day story about an elderly man visiting a military cemetery with his family. He reaches a nondescript gravestone and falls to his knees, uncontrollably weeping. Within this frame of reference is another set of bookends: two unforgettable battle sequences. Like its epic World War II film predecessors?The Longest Day and A Bridge Too Far?Saving Private Ryan features a long list of key and supporting actors, including: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, and Bryan Cranston. Also like its predecessors, the featured actors, who may or may not have served, do justice to the material and pay tribute, with earnest portrayals, to the men who helped make their comfortable American lifestyles possible. The first battle, at Omaha Beech during the landings at Normandy, is staggeringly realistic in its brutal recreation of June 6, 1944. The omnipresence of Spielberg's documentary-style camera assures us that the relentless intensity of that violent confrontation does not escape our attention, even if no single viewpoint could have witnessed the totality of the carnage. Back in the States, a woman in a government office, typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action, notices what appears to be a discrepancy, but reveals itself as the premise of the plot: a soldier named James Ryan has lost all three of his brothers in battle. The order to find Ryan and secure his safe return home falls to Captain John Miller (Hanks) who, along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing, embark on a rescue mission, the value of which they question every step of the way. Writer Robert Rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development, philosophy, and humor into the action-oriented middle. Much of it succeeds; some of it rings false. The more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action, like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church, or the one on the steps. Easily the most heart-wrenching (and gut-wrenching) scene finds Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) downed by gunfire, surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance. He asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling, and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver. They beg him to tell them how to fix him. Resigned to his fate, he just asks for more morphine. When we finally meet up with Private Ryan (Damon), he refuses to abandon "the only brothers he has left." There is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions, but it seems obvious what has to happen: Miller and his men will assist Ryan's squad in securing the bridge before sending Ryan home. The development of Ryan's character is, to say the least, disappointing. I have two brothers of my own, and I find it hard to believe that a man, even after two years of displacement, would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers, and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers (and the only one we witness) is frivolous, emotionless, and unfunny. I also find Upham's cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend, as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption. In the end, what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary. The emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn, sympathetic characters that we have come to know and love?without whom we can't bear to endure; these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own. Therein lies the successful failure of Saving Private Ryan: whether intentional or not, the non-commanding presence of its fictional characters, paralleled by John Williams' brilliantly simplistic three-note theme, leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet, commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war. When Captain Miller tells Private Ryan to "earn this," in a sense, he is asking us to live our lives in a way that will earn the price paid by those bands of brothers who sacrificed it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Best Portrayal about everything."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War films have been made earlier and will be made till eternity. But 'Saving Private Ryan' will have the image of what Gandhi has today (Irony intended.). This has set a standard so high that I think it would nearly be Impossible to have a portrayal better than this, especially the first 30 minute scene. Now this first part is what the world recognized thoroughly and it deserves that. But the second and the major part of the story is equally amazing. The film captures the journey of a group of 8 people who set out to find out another of their comrade named- "James Ryan.". They have to travel all the way to him just to deliver the message that all his brothers are dead and that he is relieved from duty. During their journey they encounter snipers, moral dilemmas etc. the idea of 8 people putting their lives at stake for just one person, is an intriguing story and to supplement that you will see a hell lot of action. This is a film not to be missed.PROS: Spielberg is a man who does things with huge perfection. There are many ways to see this film. One might see it as a nice action film in which people are assigned a task and they accomplish it by fighting a lot of people. It's the simplest way to put it. But the other way to see it is in a question format. First the question arises as to why 8 people were sent on a near suicide mission to find just one person. Why can't let the war finish. And if he is alive, let him be relieved. But then here comes morality. The superficial answer to the question is that the mother who has already lost 3 of her sons and so her only son should not be risked. So in a way we are taking quantity to be the major factor in here. The analytical reason to send them on such a mission is left to the viewer to decide on his own. Some might say that it is just a form of duty. Correct. Some will say that loss of 4 compared with loss of 1 or 2 is greater. OK. Some might think that a person who has lost his three brothers is more eligible to leave the war than any other, because his grief is higher. OK. So in a way this first question is a direct check on how you view rules of lives or your perception towards human decisions. I would say this is a perfect question and portrayed in the best ways. Second question is direct and is asked by the team people themselves. They are perfectly right in their thinking. Are their lives not as important as any other one who is fighting? People who watched carefully from the starting and thought about the first question nicely, they will be counter attacked by this phase of the film. Isn't it intriguing, to have included the viewer so closely in a film? During this second phase, the team is under a lot of emotional turmoil. They want to abandon the mission. From this moment the third question starts. Which is ? 'is doing the duty and obeying orders so important that you put your lives at risk?' While most will say to this question that they are doing the duty for the country. But keeping myself in their positions, I feel too much agitated about the objective of the mission. Why should I risk my life for this purpose? None of them were reluctant in doing their duty for the country but the objective of this mission stirred them. Next we come across a very emotional moment when Tom hanks says that he is doing this so that he completes the mission and can go home peacefully. He says this line with so much emotion that you will forget everything about the three questions and look for Ryan yourself.This film has everything for people of all ages. It also has light humor at appropriate places. The beauty of the war films is that you have a funny moment and just after that you come across a heartbroken statement. After watching the film you will definitely get convinced that war changes people. One other scene that I will never forget is the authentic knife fight between a US officer and a German officer. That fight depicts what a person behaves in his last moments of death. Also I felt sad over the two strange people fighting and killing so ruthlessly just on some orders.Also I would like to explore the message of the film in detail. Tom hanks in his last moment says to Ryan ? 'Earn it.' These two words alone have a lot of depth. The inner meaning of the word is that the life is wonderful. One should make good use of it.MESSAGE: "Earn your Life." VERDICT: "A must watch."</fullReview>

The gore and violence is extremely present, and may disturb some viewers. Also, the ending is very emotional, as are most deaths in this film. The whole overtone of the movie is also extremely dreary and bleak. A very good film, though not for everyone. But, if you can handle it, it is guaranteed to be one of the best movies you have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan (1998) Director ? Steven Spielberg Cinematographer ? Janusz Kaminski Writer ? Robert Rodat Editor ? Michael Kahn Favorite quote ? "Captain Miller: James, earn this... earn it." Saving Private Ryan is an epic war film set during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. It is a film noted for its graphic and realistic portrayal of war. Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic high intensity tour de force following Captain John Miller (protagonist) and his team depicting the Omaha Beach Assault on June 6, 1944. It later follows Capt. John Miller and his hand-picked team of seven other soldiers including one newcomer who have served with him throughout the war as they search for a paratrooper, Pvt. First Class James Ryan, who is the last surviving brother of four servicemen.Saving Private James Ryan and bringing him home is Capt. Miller's new mission and his ticket to be home with his family. Capt. Miller faces several group of opposing enemies (Germans) and loses his couple of soldiers on the way to find Pvt. Ryan. The squad finally finds Pvt. Ryan on the outskirts of Ramelle. Pvt. Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, and their mission to bring him home. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not feel it is fair to go home looking at the small band whose duty it was to defend a bridge and destroy an approaching German mechanized unit. Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available. Germans arrive in force with more than 50 men supported by armor. In spite of inflicting heavy German casualties most of the Capt. Miller's men are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Capt. Miller is shot and morally wounded. He is about to be bombed by a tiger tank when an American P-51 Mustang (tank destroyer) flies over and destroys the tank followed by more P-51s and advancing American infantry. Pvt. Ryan stays with his Captain as he dies and says his last words.The film ends with the present day Ryan, now a World-War II veteran standing at Capt. Miller's grave with his family. He asks his wife and confirms that he is a good man and he has led a good life and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Capt. Miller and his team.Saving Private Ryan symbolizes the courageous, tough and commanding persona of an Armed Force Officer and in this case, it's Capt. Miller's. His will and determination to accomplish his mission is unquestionable. He loses his life fighting for the assigned mission. From the very beginning of rattling gun fires and missiles at Omaha Beach to the very end of his life at the Ramelle Bridge, Capt. John Miller always proves to be the brave and loyal soldier of his force. Review by ? Mayank Bhattacharya</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I felt compelled to review this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, I don't take the time to review films, because it's pretty pointless trying to argue with all the fools who gave this film a bad rating, but this time I really think it needs some backing up. I've watched some pretty violent, gory films before but this was the first one where I actually felt sick. Not because it was so unnecessary, or because it was overdone, but because it was so damn real. The opening scene was so intense and realistic, it explains everything about war that can't be learned just through reading books, studying history or ever looking at old photos. The way the sound muffles to show the audience shell shock, and people lying in the background screaming for their mothers. It's a bit overwhelming, but better that than completely fake. What I really want to point out is that in order for the audience to want the main characters to succeed, there needs to be some purpose to the film, hence the storyline of a small group of soldiers searching for the last of four sons. Otherwise it wouldn't have the emotion or engagement of the audience that was intended. Also, when people complain about it being unrealistic, yes the story is fiction, but how do you know something like that never did happen? Maybe there was one German they let live, who returned later to kill their comrades. Maybe they did send a tank through a small alley. I'd like to point out that the film is in the eyes of American soldiers. It's meant to portray how they saw the war, how the enemy looked in their eyes. Basically, if you didn't want to see any of the slight exaggerations or sympathy to the Americans, go watch a documentary on war, not an incredibly realistic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best WW2 Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg directed this epic war film in 1998. It stars Tom Hanks as Capitan John Miller, Matt Damon as Private James Ryan. Ryan is only surviving son of mother and government decide to call him back. They give this mission to John Miller and his companions. Then the chase begins.Before watching it I heard many positive reviews about this movie. When I watched it I said: "Yeah, they are right". I have seen many films about war, but this is definitely something extraordinary. This is probably the most innovative war film of all time. It has great cultural impact. Spielberg created famous game Medal of Honor after this. Then it influenced some films like Black Hawk Down and s. After 13-14 years this film still have its effect on people.At Oscars film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Bes Picture and Director. It won Best Director for Spielberg, but it lost BP to Shakespeare in Love. Everyone was shocked. This is probably the greatest Oscar upset of modern times and of course, another Spielberg snub.Watch and Enjoy!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The goddamn rules just walked off?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the popularising of pacifism in the 1960s, the war movie has largely existed only to convey anti-militarist sentiment. But by 1998 there hadn't been a major decent one of those for years, and it was time for another makeover. Saving Private Ryan harks back to the genre's peak in the late 40s and early 50s, when war movies were exciting pictures about heroism and unquestionable moral reasoning. However, the intervening time in cinematic and social development can't be ignored, and so this time around combat must be realistically hellish, and there has to be some kind of philosophical questioning going on.This is all very well, but Saving Private Ryan is also very much part of the modern era's blockbuster strand, and it seems a conflict between brutal realism and cornball simplicity. In between the battle scenes there is some woefully clichéd dialogue and dramatically flat moments. Characters like Upham are just lazily-written stereotypes, and the point-making about the perils of showing mercy to the Germans is heavy-handed. Then there's the John Williams score, which is just like so many other overblown and slightly smug-sounding John Williams scores. You wouldn't think a musical score could be condescending, but this one is.Director Steven Spielberg won his second Oscar for Saving Private Ryan. As with Schindler's List, the frequency and arbitrariness of the killing soon makes us desensitised to it, and immerses us in a world where randomised death is a constant threat. And Spielberg clearly knows how to balance this. For example, about halfway through the battle we see Hanks and his men gradually making some headway. The troops aren't dropping like flies anymore, but the sheer brutality of the previous ten minutes means we never forget the danger the men are in. But the trouble is Spielberg occasionally resorts to techniques like slow-motion and sound distortion, putting the experience upon us in a way that feels obviously artificial, as oppose to letting the images draw us in. And he makes a basic error, I feel, in showing a few point-of-view shots from the German gun positions. Surely the whole point of this scene (and the movie in general) is keeping us with the US troops and never being objective, and yet Spielberg violates his own premise.And yet this is overall a well-made piece and there remains much to like. Despite the weaknesses in the screenplay's minutiae, its odyssey structure gives it a powerful sweep and makes up for the deficits in characterisation. The picture gains resonance is it goes along, and to my mind the later battle sequence at Ramille with its eerie sound effects and man-versus-tank dynamics, is superior to the opening one. Saving Private Ryan is not without its flaws, but it is enough to reinvigorate a genre that was starting to flag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could see all the effort that was put into this movie. As amazing a movie it is, it wouldn't be nearly half as good without the technical decisions that were put into this movie. From the deep emotions and feelings, to the action packed battle scenes, every part was beautifully depicted with Spielberg's technical skills.There's no doubt that the opening invasion scene left viewers entranced, and possibly with their mouths wide open. The fast cuts, character actions, camera movements, and camera placement all contributed to portraying the horrific details of war. Blood was everywhere, bombs were going off in every direction, bullets whizzed past everyone. Special effects were A+ everywhere. Switching from shots of units to shots of near-death individuals, the film made sure viewers knew exactly what was happening.After the rifles have cooled down a bit towards the middle of the film, Spielberg started to employ calmer camera shots and movements. Shots were slower but nevertheless effective. One may never even notice the cuts, as the shots are fluid and 'invisible'. This shows Spielberg is still taking consideration into these shots but is avoiding anything unnecessary. From low angles to close ups, the viewer involuntarily receives the messages Spielberg wants to convey.Almost the whole film was actually a flashback, which the viewer learns towards the end. The low angle shot of Pvt Ryan(Matt Damon) beautifully dissolves into a low angle shot of Grandpa Ryan. (not his grandpa) This ties everything together; the old man in the very beginning was actually Ryan who visited the grave of Cpt Miller(Tom Hanks) and had a flashback of the war, which was followed by him coming back to the present. How Spielberg made the actual film in this manner provided such a stronger impact on the viewer towards the end than if it wasn't a flashback at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a great display of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Saving Private Ryan (1998) by Steven Spielberg is a war film but it can be seen as much more than that. Throughout the film, Spielberg placed a great emphasis on the emotional and psychological effects that a war can place on soldiers. Captain Miller's platoon is put through several situations that cause them to lose loved ones and throw morals out the window as their mentality about life changes. Their grueling lives are shown to be an example of the real aspects of war and let people around the world think differently.As the soldiers are placed on Normandy beach, they have a hatred for the German soldiers that can be seen throughout the battlefield. Some soldiers yelled "Don't shoot, Let them Burn" while others shot the "enemy" point blank even when the Germans surrendered. No mercy was given. The soldiers lost their human nature and became angry killing machines. Their hatred blinded them from seeing that the Germans were human beings also who were, in some cases, ordered to be on the battlefield. Just as American soldiers were drafted into the war.In a later scene where Private Wade dies, the effects of the war are seen taking a toll on the soldier. Several soldiers hit, torture, and ridicule the German soldier for killing one of their beloved members. Imagine watching one of your good friend dying in front of you. That moment will have a great impact on you since you will be living with that memory forever. These soldiers had to face this moment so rage overcomes them to hurt the German soldier. Even when the German desperately tries to relate to the Americans by singing American songs and chanting "F--- Hitler" and the captain lets him go, some of the soldiers still want revenge. The hardship of the war is psychologically affecting them. Their hatred begins to build and build to the point where the soldiers yell back and forth while holding the other at gun point. The tension just keeps rising.The last battle scene showed a great representation of the effects of the war and showed a change in some of the characters attitude. After the frustration of losing two soldiers, Private Reiben was livid when Private Ryan didn't want to leave his post. Edward Burns (Reiben) gave an excellent performance of this frustration that his character later turned into a brotherhood. He began to let go of the hatred to fight side by side with Ryan as did the other soldiers to successfully protect the bridge. When Corporal Upham shoots the German soldier, who was let free from the Wade scene, was a special moment in the last battle scene. I think that Upham was a representation of innocence being deteriorated by war. Throughout the film, Upham was the morally right character who believed in doing things the right way. He had a special innocence during the war. But after seeing the soldier shoot the captain, that innocence is gone. At this point, he begins to see the life of war for what it really is. Upham gains a war mentality and kills the German soldier. With no regrets.This film was a medium to let viewers get a peek of the lives of soldiers in wars. But I also feel that this film ask important questions like, When considering the amount of deaths, is war really the answer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a breathtaking film. You honestly know exactly what these soldiers are feeling, it's unbelievable. I've never sat through a 3-hour movie without being bored. Well, this was the first time I was not bored. Whenever there wasn't war action, there was emotionally touching moments that grabbed your attention even more. Just...wow. Also, most of the battle scenes were incredibly accurate. The first scene, "D-Day" was EXTREMELY accurate that my old history teacher let us watch it for an accurate depiction. After doing the research, almost the whole 20 minute scene was historically accurate. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's well worth the 3 hours. One of my favorite movies of all time. Fantastic film10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I absolutely loved this movie the first time I saw it, and I still love it. The first hour of the movie is about as real of a depiction of war as Hollywood can get, and to this day I have not seen a more realistic and justifiably gruesome and wrenching depiction of war. Probably one of the most intense moments of the movie is not when the actual fighting is happening, but when the letters are being written to the families of the deceased soldiers, and the subsequent visit to the Ryan farm. The last hour or so of the movie was a little over the top for me, considering how Spielberg had made the first hour of combat seem so believable, but I digress. The soundtrack is excellent, and the style of filming is vintage Spielberg. The length of the movie a nearly three hours may discourage some of the viewers, but this one is definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a very fast paced war movie with lots battle scenes throughout. One of the best war movie ever released in modern cinematic history. This is Spielberg's best film along with Minority Report, Jurassic Park, Jaws and Schindler's List. The look of it is phenomenal, and th acting is very well done. Tom Hanks is really at the top of his game in this epic. His best performance since his role in the movie Forrest Gump. And every scene is shot with very well shot and the filmmakers payed very close attention to detail. Although the movie is not historically accurate, it does give you some insight on how brutal World War II was. If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it or buy it right away. Saving Private Ryan is a true masterpiece..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan was a well made film by Spielberg that was researched throughly. The action scenes, dramatic scenes, and other scenes actively portrayed what war was actually like during World War 2. While in real life an individual named private Ryan did not exist, the director makes you feel everything that the troops are feeling through use of sight and sound. This film in my opinion is a classic that all generations must witness. This movie is not for children however due to graphic content. Viewers must be aware of excessive violence, language, and sadness. All but three individuals in the film are fictionouse and do not, nor have exsited. All similarities between characters portrayed in the film and individuals in life are simply coninscidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has created another masterpiece along with his famous Schindler's List. It can speak for itself with all the Academy Awards it won such as Best Director, and multiple nominations like Tom Hanks for Best Actor. This movie released in 1998 is ahead of its time. After watching it, I considered it to be an instant American classic. The movie starts off in modern day with a family walking with their elderly veteran of World War II in a Memorial Cemetery. They follow him to a grave labeled Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) where he breaks down and begins to cry. The story then flashes back to 1994 following Tom Hanks as he storms Normandy Beach on D-Day. If you want to see a movie that reals you in right away in the first 30 minutes, then Saving Private Ryan is that movie. The first half hour of this movie are the U.S troops storming Omaha Beach in Normandy, and I believe this is the best war action sequence of all time. It is shockingly intense as it portrays the horrific realism of war at its finest. It really makes your stomach weak when it gives Tom Hanks point of view where he sees men literally trying to survive the onslaught American Soldiers. After the first 30 minutes, the story then goes on to tell how Captain John H. Miller and seven other men must search for a paratrooper, James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of 4 who served in the U.S. Army. The opening Omaha Beach scene reveals the death of the other 3 brothers who were killed in action. The morale of all these men are at an all-time low after watching their fellow soldiers being slaughtered on Omaha beach. To make things even harder for them, they are now chosen to go on a dreadful mission that increases the chances of losing their lives. The possibility of finding Private James Francis Ryan is almost impossible or as Miller says, it's like finding "a needle in a stack of needles". All of the men have seen combat before except one, Upham, who is just a translator. They all have an internal conflict of why they have to put their lives on the line to save someone they don't even know is even alive. The movie is based off a flashback of a World War II veteran. The movie has the ability to suck you and make you feel as if you are in the battle yourself because of its realism due to sound and special effects of machine guns, grenades, army tanks, and explosions. What makes the movie so intense that there is no music throughout the story. Music is usually used to set the tone of a scene or hint things to the viewer. Adding no music to the story gives the viewer a hellish and gloom feeling for the characters. The only music is nondiegetic and is played before and after the flashback of James Francis Ryan. It is a brutal movie, yet that is what makes it so satisfying. This movie would not be what it is if the lead role was not performed by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks has the credentials after winning multiple academies for Best Actor in Philadelphia and Forest Gump and was nominated for Best Actor in this movie. He plays the role of a humble captain leading seven men on a nearly impossible mission. He does an amazing job displaying fear with his actions such as shaky hands before battle, and then shows great poise during battle. He still keeps in mind that the only way back to his wife is to find Private Ryan. The supporting cast does their job to create an epic movie, but do not nearly do as well as job as Tom Hanks. Edward Burns' Reiben, who appears to be one of Miller's best men in the film who uses pessimistic humor to cover up his doubts of the mission at hand. Jeremy Davies who plays as Upham, creates a character who will make you scream at his cowardice, but also makes it extremely believable and sympathetic because of the gruesomeness of war he witnesses. The climax of the movie is when Matt Damon, Private Ryan, is found. He plays his role very well as you feel compassion for the soldier after he hears the loss of his close brothers. There was only one little problem with the movie the movie although it still does not make the outcome any different about how I feel. When the men discover that Private James Francis Ryan was still alive, Private Ryan refuses to go home because it's unfair to the others. My grandfather was in the Korean War which was not even close to being as bad as World War II, and he left with no hesitation. My good friend told me his grandfather laughed at that scene because he said no man wanted to be there. If you talk to any war veteran they would say they would leave in a heartbeat. Especially in Private Ryan's case, he is the only remaining child in his family which should be motivation enough. However, one could depict it as commitment to military service or patriotism. Usually when I watch an American war film, it is either an action film of heroism or of tragedy. This movie contains both and that is what makes it unique and compelling to watch. The plot of this film is amazing because of gripping realism. I still cannot describe the outstanding intensity of the battle scenes throughout the movie thanks to the Direction of Steven Spielberg. As the men travel through Europe, you may ask yourself throughout the movie, "Is one man's life worth the lives of eight others". The movie is a must see for audiences of age 17 and older.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserves the title of film. It is not just a movie. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of instilling historical accuracy. He made it a priority and it paid off. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that will stand the test of time. I could show this to someone who knew nothing of world war 2 and they would be quickly caught up on the things that happened. The characters portrayed the actual feelings of soldiers during the time. Most soldiers were scared and unsure. Most war movies portray fearless and unquestioning soldiers, which is not accurate. After the Sullivan brothers this type of situation was more common. This is informative yet interesting. It is not dry like most other informative pieces. This is also addresses the fact that most veterans are still affected by the war.</fullReview>

The accuracy during the opening scene when Normandy was attacked was very well shot. Most movies I've seen are inaccurate because so many things go the way of the heroes. Saving Private Ryan took me by surprise because it shows the constant struggle, both physically, mentally, emotionally etc. Event though the story might not have happened as far as soldiers saving Private Ryan, it is a very good story and can be thought of as a great movie in my opinion. Saving Private Ryan will be added to my collection of my all-time favorites! Tom Hanks has got me interested in World War Two</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an awesome representation of D-Day and supplemental missions. I thought that the although 'fake' mission to save Private Ryan was also fairly accurate. People do not realize that war was a terrible place to be and that many people did not die as quickly and peacefully as other movies depict. I also must commend the director for portraying the character of Upham. Spielberg created a character that everyone absolutely hated. The screenplay as well as cinematic feel of the movie were better than any other movie to date in my opinion. The inaccuracies of the movie do not take away from the story and are all just minor things that most people overlook. The major flaws are not even that big of a deal, just things with emblems and the such. All in all, this movie shows a fairly accurate portrayal of WWII.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Saving Private Ryan was a well put together movie. It is very realistic to everyone that watches it, but especially to the War Veterans. This is one of those movies that will hit you emotionally, but at the same time you will want to watch it over and over again. The actors did a really great job, and Steven Spielberg did his part in directing this really great movie too. Anyone who reads this review should try to watch this movie, even though it was made in 1998 you would think that it was made just a few years ago or earlier, That's how great this movie actually is. I will never get bored watching this movie, and I give full respect for every person that has ever served in war, because it takes a lot of strength and courage to do what these men and women did, and still do today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves historical recognition. Private Ryan's story is loosely based on the story of the Niland brothers. The Niland brothers all went into the war, and only two of the four survived. When our guys landed on the beach, Steven Spielburg did an excellent job at making it realistic. He didn't have all of our guys ready to fight and kill the Germans; he showed that some or the soldiers wouldn't have been able to handle it. He showed their fear. He also did a very good job of making us not like the translator. I liked how Speilburg ran the story line of actually going out and saving Private Ryan. This way, the audience got a chance to connect with the characters, and it gave the death of Wade in particular a lot more of an impact. Like all war movies, they got stuff wrong. Some of the weapons fired more than they would have been capable of the time period, or blew up before they got hit. I think Tom Hanks did an incredible job of playing his role, and that the audience was able to pick up on that. Also, the ending was a complete blind side. I thought for sure the old guy in the beginning was Captain Miller because of how they introduced him, and to find out that it was actually Private Ryan who survived caught me completely off guard. I also thought that it was ironic that the soldier who wanted to leave the mission was the only one out of the eight to survive. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about how combat on D-Day actually went. Saving Private Ryan had to be one of my favorite war movies of all time.</fullReview>

I liked how they had to go find private ryan. The movie changed my moods a lot because of how realistic it was. At some points in the movie i wanted to cry. Now that i have seen this movie i understand why some people that served in the war did not want to see this movie, or had to walk out during it. Most of the movie was very accurate. I think this is a good movie to show to people if you're trying to show them how the war was, and some of the horrible things that happened in it. This movie was great and i rated it ten stars. I would love to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be enjoyable even though there are some historical inaccuracies. I feel that this movie does an incredible job of portraying the landing at Omaha. Even though the portrayal is not exactly how it happened, it gives the audience a glimpse of what it was like to be storming the beach. I felt that Spielberg did a good job in the way that he showed the explosions. In a lot of movies when a bomb goes off its just a big fireball. When bombs and artillery hit things in this movie debris actually falls and it looks a little more realistic. Another thing that a lot of war movies get wrong is that they show people die automatically after being shot. In this movie not everyone dies instantaneously after being shot, which in my eyes is more war-like. Another aspect I thought this movie did right was the amount of ammunition. You always see guys in movies shoot constantly without reloading or running out of ammo. For example, when the one German soldier comes up the stairs a hand to hand battle ensues because the two Americans were out of ammo. You can pick any movie apart if you look for errors. The big picture is what counts and this movie is accurate in the way it depicts war for the most part.</fullReview>

It showed how the soldiers acted, and most of the people today would be very surprised to see that. I thought searching for Private Ryan was a great story line. You got to know the characters and really understand what soldiers felt when they went into battle. Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies because of its real life action scenes. They actually have to reload in most movies it seems like no one is reloading and no one misses. Saving Private Ryan shows them running out of ammo, missing close shots, and throwing your helmet because that is the first thing that comes to mind. That is why i think that Saving Private Ryan is such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before beginning with this review I must say this movie is Tom Hanks BEST acting role out of all of all his many different roles he has played. As the movie progresses it show the bonds of brotherhood that are made with soldiers during a very dark period. As this movie continues, you (the viewer) also get caught up with these bonds and you almost feel like you belong while watching this spectacular movie. I must praise Steven Spielberg for his directing in this movie, as the bonds between the soldiers of war continues you are able to feel the pain, suffering and emotions that soldiers go through as they take their last breaths. Although this movie is based on a dark period of time, this movie becomes an eye opener to the general public of how painful and cruel wars can be. Although we cannot ever fully understand the pain and suffering soldiers go through in a war I believe that this film is the closest representation of the suffering and pain in a war that can ever be expressed in a movie. This is a very amazing and emotional movie which WILL leave you in tears.</fullReview>

No doubt that is one of the best ever war depictions ever made. We've never been to any war to vouch for something as real. But the first few minutes of the movie looks like straight from the battleground. A sheer raw terror is unleashed. The story is all about saving one person whose all three brothers are dead. According to a policy of the US government, the lone survivor of the family should be saved. The whole movie shows the efforts of the U.S troops to find out the person. There is some amount of banality in the movie. But overall the movie is a good one and considered one of the best war movies ever made.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are great, as well as the rest of the cast. THe production value is very hight, every explosion is great, and most importanly, I was never bored.Every thing kept my interest, the fighting, the struggles of the crew, by the end, I actually wished it had been a little longer, and that is the sign of a very good flick.</fullReview>

So the general orders Cpt Miller and his men to find him. There were some scenes that really made me cry. like when the medic died. And there were other scenes that warmed me like when Appam (he's the shy translator) was giving a cigarette to the German that killed Wayne the medic.

		<shortDescription>Great opening sequence, then downhill into overrated territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the WW2 D-Day Normandy Beach landing, a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks are dispatched on a glorified public relations stunt to locate and retrieve the title private from the front lines.Director Steven Spielberg can be a great filmmaker, but one must beware of his "serious" efforts designed to win over his detractors, film critics and Oscar voters. These "serious" films can run from the masterful like The Color Purple or Schindler's List (despite a few missteps in its final moments) to overrated misfires (The Empire of the Sun). SPR falls squarely in the overrated, mediocre category. Oscar voters actually made the correct decision in passing it over for the Best Picture Oscar.The opening moments - depicting the Normandy landing - are impressive. Unfortunately, the film loses that momentum the moment its story kicks in. For one thing, no one is rooting for a mission that takes these men into danger for what is basically a rather asinine publicity stunt. While it is true that the U.S. Armed Forces did attempt to return home men whose siblings had all died serving their country to avoid wiping out an entire generation of a family, this was done by sending word to that soldier's unit of his planned extraction and then doing so at a convenient moment. Entire platoons were never sent on glorified rescue missions for low-level serviceman that placed large numbers of people at unnecessary risk. So the plot is largely preposterous.While there are a number of great war films that can get away with presenting types in place of three-dimensional characters, this film is not one of them. There is very little camaraderie among these men and they largely blur together. We know them less as individuals than by the types they are presented as - and none of them are truly able to break out of these constrictions. For instance, we identify them solely as the second in command, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the newbie coward, the medic, the sniper, the jerk.Incredibly for Spielberg, who usually features rich cinematography, this film is ugly to even look at. Everything is filmed in shades of gray, washed-out blue and dirt colors, often using a jittery hand-held camera for a "you are there" feel that functions more to generate either a headache or motion sickness rather than any sort of authenticity.Once the men start off on their mission, the story repeats the same steps over and over again. One of the men will reveal something minor about themselves (i.e., a personality trait) and then be brutally killed in the next scene in the most drawn-out agonizing way possible. Then the men will trudge forth, another man will reveal something, and then be eviscerated in the following scene. One could almost do a Lawrence Welk to this - "And a one-a, and a two-a and BLAM!" The predictability of the action becomes wearisome and the only suspense lies in figuring what manner of unspeakable demise will pop up next. Will it be a bloody gunshot wound or will someone be blasted apart with Spielberg uncharacteristically allowing the gore and body parts to drench the jitter-cam? This predictable nature also allows to realize exactly where the film is headed.For instance, if the film remains true to clichés, then once the surviving men meet Private Ryan, we anticipate that he will be a sunny all-American young man impossible to hate. We also anticipate that he will be a stand-up guy that will refuse to abandon the other members of his squadron in their hour of need, so that the surviving members of his rescue mission will be suitably impressed enough to stay to fight with them. When the diminished rescue party does reach him and be turns out to be Matt Damon, drawing out his biggest aw-shucks grin and practically oozing middle-American likability, you know the film has no surprise anywhere on its repertoire.The majority of the supporting cast could change their roles and no one would notice so little impact are they allowed to make and so few are the facets to their respective characters. Two exceptions that stand out (and not in a good way) are Jeremy Davies' absolute descent into pure ham with his breakdown on the stairs and Edward Burns' unintended utter obnoxiousness throughout the course of the film. Tom Hanks is likable as usual, but he is playing...Tom Hanks. Only this time, with a slight quiver to his hand to key us in on the toll this war is taking on him.By the time the film rolls into its final moments, it has been an exhausting, unpleasant viewing experience - or something misguided people like to pretend is "powerful". Anyone with an iota of sense knows that "war is hell", but that does not mean we want to pay to have it inflicted on us for nearly 3 hours without break. I think I finally had enough at the climax when one of the men held on to a grenade too long and literally blew apart - with all of the gore that implies. I stayed to the foregone conclusion, but I think I had shut off from that moment on.And a foregone conclusion it is since Spielberg rather strangely opens the film with the elderly living Ryan visiting Arlington cemetery and then closes it again with him in another one of his clumsy codas. I have no idea what to say when Ryan turns to his family and wonders if the men's sacrifice was all worth it. However, I do know that this film, despite its most ardent admirers should not be considered one the great war films ever made. For all of its patriotism and attempts at realism, for all its brutality and in-your-face approach, its story and characters are just not worth that amount of consideration.</fullReview>

Boy, was I wrong. Still, though, I like really depressing and serious movies.Major spoiler: I love movies where one character dies for another. I find it absolutely moving. I loved how in this movie, Hanks didn't die to save Damon, but died to teach him to be a better man.Critically, this movie was amazing. The acting was fantastic. The writing was very well-done. The characters, while they could have been developed a little bit better, were still developed just fine in my opinion. The directing was great. Overall, this movie is very moving and I recommend it to everyone who can sit through blood and guts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful,emotional and uncompromising war epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half an hour of Saving Private Ryan is pure cinematic brilliance. Bullets whoosh past, soldiers search through the blood drenched sea bed for their broken limb, cry for their mums as their guts squeeze out of their stomach. It's scarily realistic, mentally scarring and utterly compelling. Although the rest of the film doesn't reach the dizzy heights the first 20 minutes managed to, it comes damn near close.Tom Hanks once again shows his charisma, versatility and range,in the role of Capt.Miller assuring us still that he is one of the best a-list actors around. The supporting cast more than match him, the pick of the bunch being Tom Sizemore as a reliable Sergeant. Spielberg's ambition and emotionally resonant directing makes sure that this film hits all the right footnotes, from unflinching battle scenes to emotional speeches. The only thing that holds this back is the script's nack of sneaking slightly into sentiment, especially in the prologue and the epilogue. But that is just a minor bum note in an ultimately groundbreaking, powerful war movie classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly a war film for the ages. The battles are long, bloody, and intense. In between, each scene is loaded with tension and suspense. In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible. It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me. Incidentally, it didn't make sense to the story's characters either, and as they discuss and find the value in the issue, the story works in its own bizarre way.Additionally, the scene in the middle of the film (where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity) struck me as dumb and unnecessary. The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything. Music is a little overly-sentimental at times, but good in other parts.Recommended.4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 5/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Spielberg in Action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's biggest hit to date is the epic war film, "Saving Private Ryan". The film follows around eight men in World War II, saving one soldier, whose three brothers were killed, and is the only brother alive. The film has powerful scenes of war and drama that teaches us the horror and drama of the war. Only Steven Spielberg, and his brilliant cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, &amp; Matt Damon, can bring an amazing motion picture that takes a deep step closer and closer until the film has its reaching point. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances of his whole career, Edward Burns was pretty impressive for his role, and Matt Damon had the shortest scenes in the whole movie, but those were good scenes. Steven Spielberg always delivers fine directing in all of his movie, but this one takes the cake. Everything about this movie, from the incredible cinematography, the intense film editing, to the explosive sound, "Saving Private Ryan" was one heck of a thrill. Though the war scenes were long and graphic, that does not stop the film's power. This film happens to be one of Spielberg's best movies yet. Also, the movie felt like a moving bio-diary of the many soldiers losing their lives in World War II. The movie felt personal, moving, emotional, and there are so many things to say about this movie, that I don't have time to say it all. This movie will always be a piece of history to me. Steven Spielberg really knows how to make a dramatic, well-acted war movie with a heart. "Saving Private Ryan", in my review, "Emotionally powerful, and completely excellent."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie at home does not do it justice. I remember being speechless and overcome with emotion at the end of the Omaha Beach landing. It was such a spectacle to see on the big screen at the cinema that I went to watch it on back-to-back nights. Spielberg does a fantastic job of putting you right in the middle of one of the most remembered and heroic days in American history. Those who do not have an appreciation for our fighting forces and the freedom they have provided us with will undoubtedly change their tune after the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is truly one of the best movies of the past 25 years. At the time, I did not think Tom Hanks could pull off the leading role in this movie. I was dead wrong. Hanks' brings a human element to the movie, which makes it work. Cast anyone else in the role of Captain Miller and I doubt the movie would have succeeded the way it did.I am not one to shed a tear during movies, but this one made me cry several times. Can you, as parents, imagine what it would be like to find out you lost a loved one during wartime? Well, Spielberg shows that when Ryan's mother crumbles to the ground at the sight of a priest coming to her door. What about the older James Francis Ryan dropping to his knees at the sight of Private Miller's grave? Asking his wife if he lived up to what Miller and his crew did for him? This is emotional stuff and at the very core of being a good human being. One who looks out and cares for others.The ensemble cast of this movie is fantastic. Each brings something different to the table and it works because Spielberg allows you to engage and relate with each character. Between battle sequences, you learn a little about each character, where they are from and who they are. This is what film making is about and there is none better than Steven Spielberg.I could go on and on about this movie, but I won't. I would suggest that everyone watch this movie and become more enlightened about the horrors of war, how it affects those within it and how these warriors share a common bond, ultimately making them brothers in arms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a movie that will make you cry. The movie is based on a true story during the 2nd World War. In the movie, Cpt Miller and his group of brothers brave the war in a mission that requires finding Private James Ryan, whose brothers have died in that violent Normandy beach invasion, and bring him back home to his mother. In order to find him, the group has to go thorugh hell, just to make sure that Ryan is found and sent back home.This movie may be disturbing to a lot of audiences, especially the first 30mins, even I was not prepared for that kind of action when I first watched it on the big screen. It looked almost real, and I could feel what the soilders felt when they were part of the 2nd World War. There are some moments that will make you puke and there are some moments where you will cry.I will give this movie a full rating, because it deserves it. But it should have won Best Picture at that year's Academy Awards. But to me, it is the greatest movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's best film (in terms of direction).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a person in Hollywood that doesn't know about Steven Spielberg. This director has dazzled people with masterpieces such as 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Indiana Jones Trilogy', and 'Amistad'. He's also known today as one of the most wealthiest filmmakers in the world.Tom Hanks is just an amazing actor. The kind that REALLY puts his soul towards his character/role and plays towards perfection. He's known for 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', 'The Green Mile', 'Apollo 13', 'Sleepless in Seattle', and 'Big'.Saving Private Ryan is by far one of the best war films I've seen, as well as one of Spielberg's best. It features outstanding acting, terrific cinematography, a powerful storyline, and of course, Captivating direction.Hanks doesn't disappoint as Captain John Miller. He plays the character with determination, fear, and dedication. One of the BEST performances I've seen from him. Matt Damon is great too, in his brief, yet convincing role. Edward Burns and the rest of the soldiers are simply terrific.Well-done cinematography is experienced throughout the film. The camera angles are just so dashing and terrific, that you simply cannot keep your eyes of this film. 'Horrific, yet gripping and intensifying'.Storyline makes this film what it really is. Its powerful in a brutal and unforgiving way. I almost cried in the end, but its a true story and highly realistic in a lot of ways. Unfortunately, its sometimes painful to watch the war scenes. Bloody and extremely violent scenes, but again, worth watching.Overall, this film is a must-see and CANNOT be missed by any movie-goer. The type of impressive direction Spielberg pulls of and Hank's astonishing performance are BIG TIME watching. Though beware again, this film is outright bloody, so don't go see it if you don't like these kind of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every casual movie fan knows the notorious first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan", and rightfully so. This introduction is just absolutely breath-taking, World War II has never been so close and in your face. However, a thing that's regularly ignored is that the other 120 minutes are really just as good. The characters are all pretty compelling, even Vin Diesel's performance is very convincing. You really manage to get to know all these people throughout the second act and you can sympathize with all of them, which in a way is kind of a bummer when they start dying on us. Screenwriter Robert Rodat puts in a whole bunch of war movie clichés (the inevitable emotional highlight!), but let's be honest, who doesn't love war movie clichés? I wouldn't say this is the definitive World War II movie because there's no such thing, but it does provide some really interesting angles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaker mired in slop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarded as one of the best war films ever made, it certainly qualifies. The opening twenty minutes are still as breathtaking, shocking and disturbing realistic as they were back in 1998. It is hard to imagine that it has now been over twelve years since Saving Private Ryan broke the mold of World War II film making.Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Director for Spielberg, Best Cinematography, and Sound, which was astonishing, even by today's standards, it failed to win Best Picture, losing out to Shakespeare In Love. Shakespeare In Love! Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but easily forgettable compared to Ryan, only proving yet again that if you touch upon the British monarchy you get Oscars.The film is a fictional account of four brothers, all serving in the U.S. Army, three of which were killed in action on or around the D-Day landings. The fourth, James Ryan played by Matt Damon is somewhere in Europe, and Tom Hanks with his platoon are sent to bring him home, to spare his mother anymore heartache.Tom Hanks, who was also snubbed at the 1998 Oscars for his perfect performance as Captain Miller, the everyman who was losing himself in the horrors of war, underplayed his role perfectly. He is believable on every level, emotionally, physically and has a sense of subtly with makes him of Hollywood's greats.The action is visceral, gritty and horrifying. But never played for crass effect. Scenes of soldiers intestines spilling out, limbs flying a sunder and brutal killing left, right and centre are recreated for one purpose. To truly demonstrate the horrors of war, and to change our perceptions of the global conflict which had almost become a joke, a setting for gung- ho action films, where the Yanks reign supreme and single-handedly win the war.This shows troops crying, hurting and making decisions which should not be made under any moral circumstances, but you understand why, whether you agree or not. There is no doubt that Spielberg is not innocent of making an American film, but it is about as even-handed as you might expect, with the exception of Tora! Tora! Tora! or The Longest Day.So, the action is first-rate, graphic and perfectly toned to recreate to horror of the last century's greatest and most of destructive conflicts. But that's only half the story.The other half is the talking, reminiscing and the almost sepia tone is more than a little cloying. The U.S. General's monologues, which seem to consist almost entirely of Lincoln quotations are overly sentimental, erring on the side of sloppy patriotism rather than Jingoism, which is hardly a bad thing but it isn't good either.The civilian scenes, such as Mrs Ryan, washing a plate as she sees the car drive down to road to inform her of her sons deaths are so sentimental that they jar against the realism of the war scenes. It's not so much contrast as it is as extreme as black and white.The action is obviously interspersed, as all war films are, with rest stops and moments of talking, pondering etc., but the scenes drag on too long and disrupt the tone of the film. On the other hand, the direction is brilliant when explaining the situations during and around the action, but Spielberg seemed to think that we needed these sloppy and often boring moments, such as The Church, and the outside the cafe in Ramelle, to express the emotional torment of the characters, but I think that these scenes are so boring and pointless that I' can hardly remember them, as my attention drifts off during them! But I do have an understanding of the soldiers, and this was achieved, quite adorably without these scenes.Overall, this is a film of two halves if ever there was one. The battle scenes and the journey through war-torn France are brilliant, gritty and educational, but the scenes of American sentimentality are in danger of derailing the whole film. Many feel that is the best war film of all time. I do not agree, favouring Black Hawk Down over this, but I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that Blank Hawk Down owes a debt to Saving Private Ryan, by opening the door to the gritty war dramas of the naughties and to the style itself.This film is on of the most important contributions to cinema ever, and has done so much to finally show to true nature of WWII and war in general. But even though I would rate this 10/10 if it was just for the war scenes, the slop just gets in the way and devalues what should have been perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful. (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Saving Private Ryan" may not be 100% accurate to the events of World War II, but we must remember it is a fictional movie that is based within real events and it isn't a documentary. I believe that it is an incredible film. There are so many powerful moments and brilliant performances from nearly every member of the cast.Giovanni Ribisi is the stand out to me with a powerhouse performance as Medic Irwin Wade, and also the most underrated performance in the movie. Every line he uttered, and every facial expression he gave during his time on screen was met with meaning and sincerity. Without a word you could tell what he was feeling. There are several stand-out moments, such as when the men were resting in a church, Wade is re-writing a letter that was covered in the blood of fallen soldier Adrian Caparzo (brilliantly portrayed by Vin Diesel), in which he had written to his parents. Wade begins talking about his mother, and tears glaze his eyes. Later, Ribisi has me reaching for a tissue as his character suffers several gunshots and calls for his mother.I think everyone should give this movie a chance. It may not be for you, but if you enjoy war movies, this one is definitely a recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie of all time, it beats apocalypse now by a long shot. I've seen this movie dozens of times now and the opening battle scene on Omaha Beach never ceases to amaze me. The realistic war scenes are gory and violent, but that's exactly what our great WW2 hero's had to go through.The acting was great all the way around by all the actors, especially by Tom Hanks. I've seen other war movies but none have compared to this, so why are there some idiots out there who say it's overrated? They obviously are jealous they don't have the talent to create a masterful war film like this.And by the way, I still don't understand why the Academy Awards didn't give this best picture in 1999, the voters to me were obviously paid off by the Shakespeare in Love producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistically great but grim!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the best movies ever made! If its not my favorite, then its definitely one of them! From the introductory D-Day scene to the final battle in Ramelle, Spielberg does a fantastic job making the viewers feel like they're in the soldiers' shoes. The horror these men have to encounter throughout the film's battles is something that has definitely changed the war movie genre for good, as for the audiences viewing it, making it a model for its genre.Even though it may occasionally seem patriotic (frequent when it comes to WW2 movies, right?), Saving Private Ryan portrays human beings as being fragile and not necessarily persuaded by the cause they're fighting for. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), for instance, only goes on with this mission that his men consider suicidal because he's fed up with this whole manslaughter and just wants to go home.The only problem I'd give to this movie would be that the German soldier who grimly kills private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) is the same one the unit encountered and nearly executed while taking control of the radar site. The fact that the same guys had to run coincidently into the same soldier again, out of the 100 or so other Germans in the battle, was kinda dumb, but that little problem was not enough to ruin the movie by a long shot!I can't believe this movie didn't get the Academy Award for best picture, but it definitely earned its 5 others for directing, photography, editing, sound and sound effects!I strongly recommend this film for about everything in it, from the acting and morality to the incredibly realistic special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Saving Private Ryan" is likely to remain in my Top 10 Favorite War Movies for a long, long time. I'm taking the time to post this edited version of a review I wrote back when I first saw the film (opening night, 1998) not because I think anyone on this site will care (or even read it), but because I feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site. I watched the film again a few days ago (probably at least my twentieth viewing), and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent one."Saving Private Ryan" is a film about honor, at its core, and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask. Director Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants, and raise questions for which there are no confident answers, if indeed there ever have been any at all.The structure of the film is symmetric, opening and closing in a Normandy military cemetery, where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade. Book-ended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questions.I say the film is about honor, and it is. What else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor? And in the process of doing so, the most difficult of all choices must be made--whether to sacrifice one's own life that others might live, or make "the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country." Spielberg's exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and, in keeping with the general tenor of the film--terrifying, numbing, disorienting, and possessed of a great sorrow--he never provides sophistic or glib answers. He leaves us at film's end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense, with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questions.Where is the honor in war? What is the relative value of a man's life? On a personal level, is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering? Other films have tackled these questions in the past, but rarely had such visceral impact. A sniper's duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe; a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective "sticky bomb": an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement. Critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded, bloodthirsty audience, but they miss the point. Spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic "Grand Guignol" that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message: killing people, especially ones that are trying to kill you, is a brutish, messy business, and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelled.After an opening 25-minute barrage that sets the tone, Spielberg and Rodat's story begins to unfold. Capt. John Miller (Tom "Forrest Gump" Hanks) must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a Private James Francis Ryan (Matt "Good Will Hunting" Damon), the sole surviving brother of four. Ryan is somewhere behind enemy lines, a trooper of the scattered 101st Airborne Division, who had dropped the night before the invasion. It is D+3 and Miller has orders from General George Marshall to bring Ryan out of the raging Normandy battle, to be returned to the safety of his motherland and his family. And so we set off on a trek through hell, a journey that will leave most of its participants dead.Each man in the squad is an archetype, and a symbol. Pvt.Caparzo (Vin "Pitch Black" Diesel) is Innocence, The Child. Wade, the medic (Giovanni "SubUrbia" Ribisi), is Mercy, The Angel. Mellish, a Jewish soldier (Adam "Dazed and Confused" Goldberg), and Jackson, the prayerful sharpshooter (Barry "61*" Pepper), embody twin motivations of Retribution and Righteousness, the Hammer and the Sword, while Sgt. Horvath (Tom "Natural Born Killers" Sizemore) and Capt. Miller serve as Fortitude and Conscience, dual engines of strength and courage that keep the small patrol on its fated course.These are the ones who perish--each slain in ascending order of significance within the simple tapestry of the plot--the human qualities that are inevitably stripped from a man as he confronts the implacable juggernaut of war. The only ones to survive the charnelhouse are Pvt. Rieben (Ed "The Brothers McMullen" Burns), the Witness, Chance ("I was born lucky, Captain!"), and tag-along interpreter Cpl. Upham (Jeremy "Spanking the Monkey" Davies), the Everyman audience surrogate, the Fool. Ultimately, it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the film."Saving Private Ryan" is not a comfortable film experience. Overly sensitive film-goers will probably be overwhelmed by it; if they can make it through the Omaha beach sequence, they'll do okay. For the rest of us, it's a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received. Personally, I was a bit surprised that it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture over "Shakespeare in Love," especially since Spielberg got the nod for Best Director. Such are the whims of the Academy. Never mind. It takes nothing away from the raw power of "Saving Private Ryan."Addendum: one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual. The stuttery, bleached-out quality of the film (primarily in the battle sequences) is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation. It's not a tremendous flaw, but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mission is a Man: A Epic War Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, US soldiers embark on the Ohama Beach in France of D-Day 1944. As the hatches of the U-boats open, hails of gunfire ricochets and hits the metal and soldiers. Many jump off the boat and into the water while the gunfire pierce through the water. Blood filled the ocean with dead soldiers dying. Loud screaming is heard as Captain John H. Miller arrives at the hellish beach with his eyes wide open. As he looks around him, soldiers are seen screaming and some are holding their lives on with fear while some finds out that their arms are shot off. Epic, pure epic. Saving Private Ryan is not a roller-coaster of action, it's triumph. It's a movie where you salute those who fought in Normandy on D-Day in World War II. Steven Spielberg delivers us the horrors, shock and amazement and triumph of World-War II since Schindler's List. I was amaze at what he brought to us. The sheer horror and amazement of World-War II is never forgotten. I have this movie on VHS, the Double Videocassette on DreamWorks, that shows the feature movie and the special edition of the movie. I also felt emotionally driven at the end when the older Private Ryan is seen looking at John H. Miller's cross and grave. He asks his wife if he was a good man and live a good life. After she answers Yes, the camera shows Ryan and his family family in the background. With triumph, he salute Miller's grave as the camera zooms in to shows the description of the grave. The last shot shows the American flag waving the sky. The film fades out. THAT is triumph and showing that American soldiers will never be forgotten. All in all, Saving Private Ryan is a epic war film that will never be forgotten and will be a war movie. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg is well-known for his big films. Saving Private Ryan is his best of the bunch by a clear mile. It is a statement in the genre of war movies. An absolute top. I'm an huge fan of war movies and this one is in my top 3 for sure. I like that there's a great piece of an human side in this movie. It's quite touching. It makes it powerful.Tom Hanks was one the best actors of the 90's. He capped the decade off with one the strongest performances of his career. He shows here why he is Spielberg's favorite actor. He has lots of talent around him. Most notably Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, a must-be guy in war movies. But others like Matt Damon, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore leave the mark too.War movies are good when they seem realistic. This one for sure is. A classic and a must-see in war genre. A masterpiece by one the most acknowledged directors of our time. Watch alone or with friends, does not matter, you get the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spielberg fantasy done horribly right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if the United States Military actually possessed a shred of decency and humanity? Shyeh! What if.In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the people who type the "Sorry Your Son's Dead" letters for the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die notice that three letters are addressed to the Ryan family of Anytown USA. Seems three brothers have been killed in the name of assuaging the small-penis insecurities of the American government. There is one more Ryan boy presumably still alive, and the Warmongers Who Send Sons Off To Die now send America's Favorite Son, Tom Hanks, to snatch the last Ryan from the belly of the beast, intending to send him home honorably. Shyeh! What if.Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the war movie by which all other war movies will be measured - not for its implausible premise (written by Robert Rodat) and typical propagandistic slant, but for its revolutionary depiction of battle scenes, more brutal than any ever committed to film. Visceral. Nightmarish. Incendiary. Words cannot do justice to the ferocious spectacle and gutshock aftertaste of the opening Normandy invasion.We meet the Yanks stepping onto the beach at Omaha, the sea more blood than brine, in a frontal assault on the Normandy coast that is going horribly wrong, as the German fortifications on the shoreline mow them down ruthlessly. Steel crossbeam obstacles called "hedgehogs" stick nefariously up from the sand in the low tide; planted to mutilate the undersides of boats as they attain the shore - if the tide had kept the hedgehogs hidden underwater - now they ironically provide the only cover for the American troops in a searing firestorm.During this blood and bone tempest we meet Captain John Hiller (Tom Hanks) trying to stay alive yet move his troops closer to the German machine gun nests and take them out. We are in the crucified heart of the battle, blood on the camera lens, rain dirt muddying the view, machine gun rounds slamming and pinging past like fireballs, gray-green desaturated filmstock and a kind of lens flare sheen around the film edges; internal body parts, severed limbs, ear-numbing explosions; a grimy, hellish, embracing maelstrom of frenzied death.Spielberg and longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski capture what has never been captured in depictions of battle - desperation, futility, the overwhelming randomness of slugs whizzing by and claiming lives, medics wasting morphine stabs on dying soldiers; confusion and screaming, bodily fluids and exit wounds, intestines mixing with mud - simply the most authentic Cinematic War we have ever seen.Hiller's mission to Save Private Ryan is painted as a spark of humanity illuminating the gross inhumanity of war. YET. The high command's decision to send a son home to his grieving mother can only be for one reason - not moral, ethical or humane - to make a future politician look golden.Hiller's ragtag squad consists of Tom Sizemore (scrappy adjutant) Edward Burns (cynic looker), Giovanni Ribisi (the doc), Barry Pepper (holy sharpshooter), Adam Goldberg (resident Jew), Vin Diesel (goombah muscle), and Jeremy Davies (scaredy cat Upham). And each man is created whole, as we discover whenever "characterization" sets in during quiet time.Captain Hiller feels every bladed inch of the Shakespeare axiom, "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown" (Henry IV). He is the victim of one bad decision after anther, not all his fault, but for his shoulders alone to bear. Each man who dies under his command takes him "one step farther from home." When Hiller's troop finds private James Ryan - he is Matt Damon, acting the hell out of the Concerned Face chapter of the Acting for Male Models handbook.To climax the movie - another skin-searing battle sequence. Spielberg is now just having the time of his life: his crew have the formula down and we are once again struck speechless by the construction of the on screen blitzkrieg that makes all other skirmishes on film look like Monty Python's Batley Townswomens' Guild Battle of Pearl Harbor.Chilling - as Goldberg's Jew struggles with a German and is stabbed slowly, deliberately; regretful - as Davies's scaredy-cat Upham could've stopped the stabbing if he had just had the guts to run up a stairway instead of tearfully ascending in fear; twisted - as Pepper's holy sharpshooter prays while he snipes that his lord keep his hand steady and his eye keen, "You are my tower, you are my shield" (which should be a morbid contradiction for Christians, that they will instead find reassuring - that "god" is supposedly on their side); disturbing - when Ribisi's doc is mortally wounded and he stutters instructions on how to "operate" on him, even as his liver is mutilated and the last of the morphine is stabbed into his leg as he expires; amusing - as Sizemore is shot and is madder at his gun jamming than at being shot; ultimately tragic - as Hiller's dying words to Ryan convey his confidence in the unproven worth of humankind, and a simultaneous indictment that Ryan could never hope to live up to: "Earn this!... Earn it." For closure, a general narrates a letter written by the People Who Send Sons Off To Die, to Ryan's mother on how the army is soooo generous for sending James Ryan home, misusing Lincoln's words about her other sons being sacrificed on the "altar of freedom" and making our flesh crawl with platitudes, euphemisms and shallow commiserations.Just think, if Franklin Delano Roosevelt had kept his promise of keeping America out of foreign wars, instead of antagonizing Japan and then entering WWII, he could have saved not only private Ryan, but also the whole godforsaken American army, navy and air force.But that would entail America actually possessing a shred of decency and humanity.Shyeh! What if.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Fine War Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made. There are some faults to it but most of the times the movie is just breathtaking especially the beginning scenes at Omaha Beach. Since this movie historical fiction, some of the aspects are not going to be real. People should stop complaining about that in not only this, but other historical movies.This movie is about how the 2nd Battalion led by Captain Miller tries to find the fourth brother to take him home because his three brothers died in war.The acting is very good here. Tom Hanks is a staple in every movie he's in. This is one of Matt Damon's early movies. This and Good Will Hunting were the ones that brought him to considerable fame.This was put forth a great effort by Steven Spielberg, my all-time favorite director. The war scenes were amazing. John Williams composed a great though small score.Overall, this is one of my favorite war movies. There is tons of violence and gore though. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most shockingly realistic battle scenes ever made in a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love war movies, Saving Private Ryan should be your favorite. The battle scenes at Normandy are outrageously shocking and realistic and it's beyond anything movie audience around the world has ever experienced before. Steven Spielberg's genius shines once again. His hand-held camera style makes you feel like you are actually there on the battlefield, in the middle of it all, bullets whizzing by, rockets exploding, soldiers dying in great numbers, as they are shred to pieces with all the heavy artillery raining down on them. It is quite breathtaking and also saddening. It is a story of a team of soldiers on a mission to save one Private, namely Ryan. Ryan is the last son of a family who already lost 4 of their sons to war. So the powers that be decide to do something nice for the mother and launches the mission: Saving Private Ryan. Rest is history. This movie took the war movies to a different level. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much more to say than this is an amazing movie. Spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the common brotherhood of soldiers in WWII. He was able to tell a story about war, death, battles, stress, and fear but also being able to capture a comedic element between the soldiers, which made the movie a bit more realistic. This movie won many awards for a reason. Overall the movie blew me away (no homo) and will always be one of my favorite movies. The war scenes in this movie where absolutely amazing and the graphic fight sequences rivaled that of the best war movies to date. This movie will defiantly be a classic movie.You would be smart to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man was this good movie. I can't believe I haven't seen by now, but now I have. I love this movie. The realism makes you feel like your with them in the battle, the conversations they have feel real, and the emotional strength it has is huge. My favorite movie from Steven Spielberg used to be Jaws, but this has defeated it. As for Tom Hanks movies this is so far my second favorite. My favorite will always be Gump, but this is still a great film. The first 24 minutes is in real time. These minutes are one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen. People die left and right. People have their guts hanging out, arms and legs are blown off, it really is a powerful scene filled with realism. Acting performances are all great, but the best as expected is from Tom Hanks. Overall this film is piece of genius.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'm a girl who is not a big fan of movies with gunshots and war, but I loved this movie. The first 20 minutes alone earned Spielberg the Oscar for best director, they are realistic, you can see and really infiltrate the horror of D Day, you can feel the despair, anger, madness and courage of the American soldiers. But what I loved the most was the fight of the principal characters for staying human and earn the right to go home after killing a lot of people, bad guys, but still people. It keeps you at the edge of your sit, wondering if they are gonna be able to find Ryan, and when they do, if they are gonna win the battle at Ramelle. The only negative thing I gotta say about this movie, is that I expected that a principal character would die and surprise! Tom Hanks dies.Going back to the beginning, the first 20 minutes left my jaw on the floor. I'm not American, but my country helped the American soldiers with supplies and nursing, and it makes you proud of pulling something right "out of this s**tty mess"Congrats Spielberg!</fullReview>

But the episodic plotting is naggingly formulaic, and the coda in a graveyard tips this nearly great film into unfortunate mawkishness. Saving Private Ryan grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing domestic film of the year.

		<shortDescription>Brutal and incredible take on WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many know Steven Spielberg as one of the most impressive and great film directors. He was the one who brought us Jaws, E.T., Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones movies, and Schindler's List( which I unfortunately haven't had the pleasure of seeing yet). However, Spielberg hasn't made such an emotionally empowering epic in all his life that is Saving Private Ryan. SPR is about eight soldiers who are sent into German territory in World War 2 to find and return home a Private Ryan who's three brothers were killed in combat. Everyone is great here, but the one person who stands out the most is none other than Tom Hanks. Once again, Mr.Hanks plays an Oscar-worthy performance as a troubled American army captain who just wants to return home to his wife. This film successfully captures the brutality and horror of war through up close and shaky, hand-held cameras. You really feel like you're in the battle evading gun fire and witnessing people losing limbs and dieing horrible deaths. In the end, I give kudos to Steven Spielberg for delivering us a gripping and brutal film that has to be one of, if not the best, WWII movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Execution...Beautiful Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read about how some people loved the movie and how some hated it. For those who didn't like it, well it is a movie. It is an effort to replicate the happenings of a long time ago when neither of us was around. Luckily, we do have a few directors who try to get real at such things ? they try; some succeed, some make a fool of themselves and some go beyond what the people of then could understand and depict a story they feel is true, complete and powerful enough to support reason.SPR is a beautiful movie. Yes, it does get a little slow and I did feel that Steven did try forcing out emotions a little in some scenes but that's me ? I hate any person who portrays army generals or commanders- I can never understand why do they have to be the wisest of the lot. I'd prefer a more humane leader ? some who'd be conflicted, guilty and in the spur of the moment resolve to send in a team, maybe of expendable soldiers to bring out a last son.So leaving the movie aside, I'd comment on the technicalities. Sound ? brilliant. I was way too small when this movie hit the theatres so I saw it at home on my Philips Dolby Surround and it hit me boom, bang &amp; centre. It was piercing, jarring, ambient and well placed. As for the music, John Williams could've done better ? it sounded very expected war hero symphony ? So far I've not quite found a soundtrack that could outmatch James Horner in Apocalypto; if you find one?let me know.Cinematography is beautiful. I've not seen a movie look like this. Very well set up and the reduced tones help bring out the sunlight and the serenity. You can see destruction and beauty side by side. The color disappears when it rain, appears in the mornings, the nights are darker so that distant firing can be made out. In all it was very well taught of.Direction, well I am not going to criticize the man who made Schindler's and Jaws. Steven is the God of film making and he knows it. He has shown it. He moves with the camera, talks through his actors and is super fast at execution ? you can feel the spontaneous takes in every scene. Still far from being Kubrick but I doubt there'd be anyone greater.P.S: Please do not make another Indiana Jones movie. You totally are spoiling what you've earned you know. That goes from me, Stan, Kyle &amp; Eric.My vote for SPR ? 8 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good World War II Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked Saving Private Ryan. Yes, it was quite long. But what do you expect?The subject was World War II. In case you didn't know, it lasted a while. Even so, I kind of like long movies. They absorb you and really provide an escape. What can I say? I'm a sucker for a good epic tale...Tom Hanks of course did a fantastic job, as is expected of him at this point. And he was joined by an amazing cast of some of my favorite actors - Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel (this was before I really knew who he was!), Ted Danson (yeah, I like Ted Danson, so sue me), Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farrina. Okay, I'll stop. Point is, these guys all played the part spectacularly.My family made the mistake of sitting down to watch this World War II bombshell while we ate supper. Let's just put it this way. The vittles somehow lost their savoriness amidst the storming of Normandy, what with the lifelike guts and gore. Mr. Spielberg was really trying to make you see the horror of the great war, which is too often romanticized. (Not that I don't like films like In Love and War; they have their place, too.)If you're weak of stomach or don't like the gruesomeness of trench warfare, skip this flick. However, if you're a stickler for an authentic war movie that delivers the reality of World War II, complete with ugly truths, you'll probably dig it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual experience 10 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was first released in 1998 and wrote a review which for some reason never got posted. 500 films later, and seeing Tarantino's very idiosyncratic war movie, "Inglourious Barsterds" I was reminded of this one, where the story is played absolutely straight in a way to give the average American patriot goosebumps. Yet the rescuing of Sergeant Ryan (Matt Damon) is actually a cynical effort by the High Command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy. Spielberg's battle scenes are really something ? ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach ? the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.Perhaps comparing this blockbuster with Tarantino is not fair, Both films entertain in there own way ? Spielberg, who gives us splendid visuals, is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and Tarantino does things his own way and doesn't care who he offends (though he does not make light of atrocity). Has the second world war movie run its course? Even if the answer is "yes" we have not seen the end of war movies in general. As long as there are wars there will be movies about them. "Ryan" at least tells a coherent story, and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting. Tarantino, on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism, but he does have fun getting there. Spielberg is more hard work, but "Ryan" has to be one of his better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To tell you the truth; I didn't know much about WW2 other than what I read in books at school. But this film really puts you there. How they were able to take control of a beach wired to explode really makes you appreciate my freedom. I just thought I'd start with that.Overall, this is an excellent movie. It really has a forties feel to it and it's really intense. From storming the beach in Normandy to the final battle. It's was good, but don't be fooled. The story itself; didn't actually happen. It was a fictional story mixed into a REAL event. We don't see this much. Titanic anybody? But the story worked.The plot is about a Squad of eight people trying to find the last remaining "Ryan" who's three brothers died so they can send him home. There's a lot of good battle scenes along the way. It might not be good for the faint of heart. I read that they actually used real amputees for when people got their legs blown off. So, be warned.Overall, I'd say this is a great film. Stephen Spielberg directing. Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamonti and Vin Diesel were in the mix. If you're into action, history or have a good heart; I suggest watching this. This film will break you down and make you feel for the people who put their lives down for your freedom.I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was generally very impressive. I liked the accuracy of the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms. The sets were very impressive, and looked just like France did in 1944, even though things were all blown up and so on. The most impressive part to me was not the main actors like Tom Hanks, but the extra's, the random actors who played random soldiers, whether they be dying on the beaches or fighting in the battlefield, or even just laying on the ground, dead. I was impressed by the actors abilities to portray the soldiers "FUBAR" attitudes, and then, if needed, portray a death with great realism. The amazing scenes to me are the scenes with any speech, just pictures, like the images of the blood running down the beach, or the dead bodies laying in the bunkers and beachhead, or the scenes of the towns, blown apart and in ruins.</fullReview>

With all the gore, dialog, action and emotion that only thing it needed was the smell. The camera angles did a great job showing what the soldiers had to do to survive. The view of the aftermath showed how terrible war was. The movie took time to show everything, even the things we didn't want to see. The only problem I had with the movie was the dialog between battles. I thought that some parts just didn't work and were to long. The dialog before and after the battles showed a lot of emotion, but between the battles were poorly showed. I Lost interest during parts of the movie because of the dialog. The movie was still good even with some poor dialog because it made up for it with it's intense action. I would recommend this movie to someone, but I wouldn't call it excellent.</fullReview>

I liked the character Up-um because I can see this happening to someone that has not been out on the field of the war.

		<fullReview>Saving private Ryan was a great representation of the events that occurred during D-day. Some scenes were hard to watch with the realization that events shown in the movie did occur in real life. I would like to have seen more in the movie about other events in the war. I thought that the characters in the movie showed much development on how they felt about the mission they are on. I thought that John Miller's role showed leadership and courage even in times of chaos. Private Ryan showed great courage and pride as he refused to leave the battle field when his services were no longer required. I thought that Upham showed fear at the end and was a disappointment as he failed to help his comrades. Upham didn't understand the horrors of war and therefore could not accept that he had to kill a prisoner in order to keep him from returning to the military even though it didn't seem like the right thing to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that depicts the environment that a soldier in ww2 would live in. It is a great movie. The way that all of the characters acted throughout the film was, in my eyes, perfect. Each had a large dislike for what they were doing but also, had an urge to do it. They all have small flaws in their character. For instance, Captain Miller has a shaky hand, probably caused by his life in the military and the stress put on by it. Also, it shows how most soldiers are tough, but also have a side that shows the true feelings of their character. Like before some of the men die, they are talking to their mom, or family members. Also, most of the men are smokers and it shows that it is brought on by the war because Upum claims that before he left for the army he never smoked, but he says this with a cigarette in his mouth.In conclusion, this movie is top 5 war movies of all time and should be watched by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very sad movie. It makes me think about what the war was about and weather or not war is worth the cost that is always paid. How would a mother feel if she had to receive a letter telling her that her son was killed in action? In the letters in the movie is was said that the people who died honorably to protect the freedom of this country. Does that justify young men being send into battle and killed? This movie does an excellent job of posing that question. It does seem to make the argument that it is not worth it. In the film the reason for the Captain wanting to go save Pvt Ryan is so he can go home to his wife. The other point this movie makes about war is that all of the soldiers, even the enemies, are all human. This is evident in the whole movie. The Germans are seen to be evil when they are fighting, but when they surrender they seem like every other character in the movie.</fullReview>

But Steven Spelburg did not back down, and stood up for what he believed in. He though that the only way to truly portray this movie was to have it include gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. This was the only way to get through to the audience how horrible a conflict World War II was, and why we should do everything possible to make sure it never happens again. Because if it does happen again, we will have to experience Saving Private Ryan firsthand, something none of us want to do. But I digress. The movie is extremely moving, and we can identify with these soldiers who are thrust into conflict without necessarily wanting to. They all have distinctive personalities, and are very original. The battle scenes really opened my eyes to how World War II was like, and the true level of the combat that took place during the war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at the beginning of the movie it starts out on the beaches of normandy, and the action and battle scenarios there are very violent but gnarly at the same time. The movie is very fast paced, with many epic gunfights, but there are also times when the actors show very passionate emotion which gives the story more feeling to go along with the constant killing. the men in the platoon sent to rescue pvt. ryan are goofy fellahs themselves and joke around with each other all the time so there is also some comedyish parts in Saving Private Ryan. the soundtrack to this movie is epic it is well directed and the acting was muy bueno (good) the end of the movie was well done with the fadeout back to the present time and his face changing from young to old!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie that i would recommend to anyone who wants a good movie, and has the time to watch a long movie. This has everything a great movie needs with action, a good plot, and a care for the characters in the movie. Also the movie has great picture and sound making you feel like your really there along with the other troops fighting to save the world from evil. Another important thing the movie does is it tries to stay close to a believable battle, and does not try to amp up the action by adding things that were not there before. Finally the movie makes great stride in allowing the viewer to connect its hero's in the past, to its hero's of today by showing in the beginning of the movie a character that is seen in the movie later in his life. With all these features working together in one great movie, it is hard not to want to watch it again and again, which can sometimes be hard with a movie of this length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best directed movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cant believe this movie didn't get the Best Picture Oscar.It's ten times better then Shakespeare in Love.I wont even mention that it's one of the best directed movies ever.The direction is simply perfect.Even though i don't usually like Steven Spielberg because he direct's a lot of science fiction movies but a got to give it to the man,he really can direct.I think he should hold on to the themes like this one.You know,World War-II and so...Every movie he made on World War-II is a masterpiece.Just look at Schindler's List for example!It's a masterpiece too.Just like Saving Private Ryan.This movie has the most realistic war scenes ever.The camera is shaky all the time and it fit's great to the movie.The battles are so...Wow!Really great.A truly remarkable directing Spielberg did.Remarkable!I think you have to be a very skilled director to make an extraordinary epic movie out from a screenplay that's written in ninety present action.Don't get me wrong,the screenplay is great too but the director is mostly responsible for this movie turning out to be so good.I also have to mention that the acting was very good too.I was mostly surprised by Giovanni Ribisi.He truly acted great in this film.Afcorse there was also Tom Hanks who is alway's great and so on...There is only one thing that i didn't like in the movie and that's the end of it.Not the complete ending but the part when they find Ryan and when they tell him that his brother's are dead!I don't know,his reaction was just too normal.I mean i would be thinking about a suicide an he barely cried!!!But what a hell,the movie is still excellent.Anyway,this is a movie that i recommend to everyone.It's great in every aspect.Just turn it on and as soon as you see the first war scene on that beach,you will be amazed!A-m-a-z-e-d!!!10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly The Best WWII Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the word "go", I felt immersed in the scene of the D-Day landings. These scenes were indeed frightening, but terrific all at the same time. The camera work was just excellent, and the acting was superb.One thing I noticed from people leaving comments, many people hold a hostility towards this film because it makes American's look like heroes. This is totally understandable, as we do often gratify ourselves too much. But, this movie was based on the lives of American's in the war, and the writer and Spielberg tried to make it as unbiased as they can, but the fact is more people look at the American fronts more than any other. This is a sad fact as nearly all countries suffered from this great (but yet horrible) war. It is clearly seen in the movie that surrenders of the German side were horrible because our American troops executed some of them, that stirred me in the wrong direction but yet it is true.And as for previous comments, the English and Canadians did help clear the beaches, but didn't play a huge role.Setting the issues before aside, this was possibly one of the best movies ever made. I know spots can get dry sometimes as will all movies, but other than that it kept me interested, and entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best WWII films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" was Steven Spielberg's tribute to the men who fought for freedom in the second world war. The film begins with the D-Day landing before moving on to a mission with the express purpose of retrieving a private whose three brothers have recently fallen in combat.The story is loosely based on a similar case involving four brothers by the name of Niland. However, Robert Rodat's screenplay also uses Ryan to represent the unknown individuals that these soldiers risked (and often lost) their lives for. The script is occasionally clumsy in its attempts at profundity but not enough to be a major distraction.The cast is a varied and well-assembled lot. Tom Hanks secured the film's only Oscar nomination in the acting categories but the entire cast upholds a high standard of workmanship. Even actors whom I usually don't care for, such as Edward Burns and Vin Diesel, deliver performances that fit in seamlessly with their peers and their surroundings. As a result, I have to credit the casting director with finding the right actors for the right parts.Spielberg's direction won him his second Oscar in that category and is everything that you would expect from him. The first twenty or so minutes in particular (the D-Day landing) is riveting while Spielberg continually shows himself capable of handling all situations and settings with aplomb. Of course, this wouldn't be a Spielberg film without a John Williams score. Williams contributes a fine score here, if not quite reaching the same lofty heights as his very best work.All things considered, "Saving Private Ryan" is quite an achievement. It boggles the mind that "Shakespeare in Love" beat this for the Best Picture Oscar. Surely that is a snub to go down in history along with the likes of "Raging Bull" &amp; "Apocalypse Now".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly amazing!! Saving Private Ryan is one of those rarities, it's a war film with heart. This amazing WWII film stars Tom Hanks as Capt. John Miller a solider who's seen too much and who is done with war, during D-Day him and his unit are ordered to find a single solider by the name of John Francis Ryan a private in the airborne division who just recently lost all three of his brothers in combat, now Miller and his men have to bring Ryan back alive while out running the Nazis and there conscious. Saving Private Ryan is a dedication to the men who died to protect there nation and there freedom they were soldiers who battled against oppression and evil. they fought for what they believed was right and conquered and this film shows that one man is just as important as the rest. I very highly recommend this astounding Motion picture. I hope my review helps ~ C.R. Lopez.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan: a monument of a film to the most egregious miss-planning of the second world war by a stupid military leadership who put thousands of men on a hot-beach without any air support or destroyer big-guns covering the landing - Monty/Eisenhower should have been horse whipped for this atrocity!Of course Spielberg panders to this memorial-to-democracy and shows the beach scene in all its horror - the bloody waves particularly jarring. After the actual reenactment, Spielberg strolls into a fiction where a troop led by Hanks seeks out Private Ryan (parachuted behind German lines and now lost) to return him to his Mom, as his 3 brothers have been recently killed in other theater Allied errors. 'Lets not leave Mom bereft of sons' the word from the highest admin. officer in the Allied force. As an aside, my Grandmother lost all six of her brothers in the First World War, and her only two sons in WW2 with nothing more that a series of belated condolence letters from the DOD.So, off goes 'Captain' Hanks and his motley crew on their 'highest-echelon priority' army mission - two separate incidents along the way diminish the unit by the time they catch up with 'Private' Ryan (Damon), who in no uncertain terms tells Hanks he has his-mission and will stay with his unit and defend a bridge! In the proper-Army, at this point the Captain would have clapped Ryan in irons for insubordination and returned him unceremoniously to the brig for court marshal - Spielberg permits 'none of this' as Hanks and his, now hapless, unit must face a couple of German Tiger tanks and 15 German foot soldiers equipped with serious hardware - our hero's defend with: machine gun, rifles (a pretty good sniper), sidearms and the makings of 'sticky bombs' - socks filled with explosives and covered with 'convenient' axle grease, so they will 'stick' to tank Armour. (The guys are now fighting sock-less, duh!) The battle commences - as furious as the beach scenes - and all in Hanks unit are killed. Ryan survives without a scratch, of course! Hanks the last to die (down to a sidearm now) as an Allied fighter drops a precision-bomb on the remaining tank that made it to the bridge - directly onto its turret, disabling it.Truly beyond-belief: precision bombing from WW2 fighters is utter nonsense, and where were these guys during the 'landing on the beach?'; why was Ryan not promptly removed from theater? i.e. why was US Army discipline a turkey shoot after the beach landing? Then, of course, we are treated to a return to the opening - a decrepit old man (Ryan now, we understand, we thought it was a geriatric Hanks at the beginning?) in a military graveyard (San Diego Pacific overlook, I think?) -- the surest testament to the stupidity of War -- looking for Hank's grave. Ryan asks his wife '... if he was a good man'? Clearly, this miscreant should have been hung or shot back in '44!Production Notes: Score inspired by the opening: "Fanfare for the Common Man", Aaron Copland which of course quickly descended into John Williams patented nonsense, yet again.Spielberg, wooden and pandering for cheap emotion as always, other than the action scenes which were probably 'actioned' by Spielberg's tasking of the 10 assistant directors on the piece. The beach scene (reality, it happened of course) pointless beyond belief and an embarrassment to mankind - what military leader would put men onto a hot-beach without air support or 10" guns blazing from warships offshore? A monumental blunder! Spielberg has Hanks report on the 35 of his men killed after we have see every one hit, egregious! Surround Foley outstanding, as expected.Character assassinations: excellent performance from Tom Sizemore (disciplined, got his Blackhawk Down chops here) and Barry Pepper* (sniper); Hanks quite adequate as Captain, but predictably too democratic to survive; Adam Goldberg (first guy to break down) should have been spared from doing the 'Juden' thing to German POW's; Giovanni Ribisi underused as was Paul Giammati &amp; Dennis Farina; Jeremy Davies' character, the last guy you would want around; Ed Burns superfluous, as was Ted Danson; Vin Diesel a joke to his end.* this role cribbed from Sniper: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108171/ but Pepper's role a template for 'Enemy at the Gates': http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215750/ the grisly dueling-snipers flick.After a film like this is released to such accolades (sic), why would family-men be put in harms-way ever again?

		<fullReview>When you think war movies. Now. Now you should only think of one, this movie. This movie is a true masterpiece, it truly signifies war in a realistic environment. There may be some Cleches or wrong historical facts, but that isn't whats truly important. What is important is that this movie is a turning point in how everyone should judge any war movie. Its compelling and rich and full of emotion and drama, it grips the viewer with significant empathetic features that only Spielberg could pass. As a youngster (when I first viewed this, and I still am compared to most on here I presume) the first bullet to bullet packed minutes captured my mind and didn't let go. It's the first thing that ever made me actually think about war in another light. Before (being young) we think its all wiz, bang, boom you're dead. After the first few minutes you can truly interpret what war really is. HORRIFYING. This movie is one of my favourites the casting was perfect in every way and the directing also perfect. I couldn't think of any better ways to make this movie better. 10/10 all the way.Thank you for viewing my comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 years later, still has impact and still unrivalled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this on the big screen, my senses were literally violently shaken, my heart pounded with fear and adrenaline within the first 5 minutes. No other war film made me feel like I was in it and feel the real horror that war is. It comes sudden and when it does, its relentless, leaving you breathless. On second viewing, 10 years later on a small screen, the shock element has of course slightly diminished but the impact and dare I say it, adrenaline rush is still there.I have since seen several war films which have used Spielberg's ground- breaking first person perspective war film tools such as Thin Red line, Band of brothers, Letters from Iwa Jima, Flags of our Fathers etc (in fact most of these. apart from Thin Red Line, were produced by Spielberg). But none has bettered the astounding execution of brutal warfare as Saving Private Ryan. I now view it as the greatest action war movie of all time. The mission to save Private Ryan is a riveting one as the 8 protagonist soldiers undertake detour missions to reach their goal. The soldiers are depicted as flawed, sometimes confused, sometimes disillusioned, brave, frightened, cowardly, rational, irrational...all the elements of chaos that war brings and burdens the soldiers minds including their captains. The squad comprises a typical range of characters, perhaps some stereotypical in war films but all played wonderfully, not over the top, not caricatured but like real people that we may know. Hanks as ever superbly holds the film together as he leads his squad into the chaos. My favourite character though is the clumsy, bumbling interpreter who has limited combat skills and struggles to be brave, a role wonderfully played by Jeremy Davies who later perfects those delightful hesitant mannerisms as Daniel Faraday in the Lost TV series). The most conflicting question being raised throughout the film and by each soldier was the worthiness of risking many lives (or indeed wasting valuable resources) to save one soldier who may or may not be alive. This really is the main theme, posing a great moral dilemma.Some complain that there is absolutely no reference to other allies involvement but why is that necessary? Every ally had their own missions. I am British yet I do not make any qualms. Britain has made their own war films with British only protagonists. America can do the same. They did fight too regardless of the fact they entered into it late but they did fight. And no ally won the war by themselves. The Allies as a whole won the war.But I digress. This movie can be classed as simply a great action packed war film but it is layered with moral conflicts, incredibly brutal realism and fine performances all round. A magnificent achievement that has yet to be bettered 10 years on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where I won't deny that it is a overall well made movie, I can't give it the acclaim it seems to have gotten from anti-war people gushing over it's so called 'message'. To me, it was WAY too in your face about it's anti-war message, it's like it was shoved down your throat and most of the movie leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. The violence, however realistic, is gratuitous and for me personally, takes away from the message of the movie. The premise and execution is also to me nothing special, it's everyone's vision of an 'American War Tragedy', it brings nothing special or eloquent to the table for me either. I feel that Hollywood only seems to know how to communicate messages by going way over the top, it's like they don't seem to appreciate the value of subtly or think people can't comprehend the message unless you have a 20 minute scene of soldiers being blown to bits. You don't have to hit someone with a sledgehammer to get their attention, and if that's the audience you are going for then it doesn't speak well of the intellectual value of the movie in the first place. I feel like the masses that will go on and on about how great this movie is are the people who only frequent the usual blockbusters and don't have especially high expectations in the first place. To me, it lacked a lot of valuable things that would have made it a truly GREAT story, but I will say it will most likely not disappoint your average viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg revisits WW2 with heroic honors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1993 saw the premier of "Schindler's List", Spielberg's bracing and emotionally scorching story about Oskar Schindler. 1998 he re-visits World War 2 and produces an equally powerful story about the saving of one man's life in the midst of post D-day battles. It is an appropriate temptation to compare his two seminal WW2 films, both such very powerful dramatic stories. Both concern themselves with salvation, with Schindler on the large scale and Ryan just one man. In the process of saving the many Jews he did Schindler was also somewhat successful in redeeming the moribund humanity within him. Tom Hanks' character in Ryan (Cpt. John Miller) does not need personal redemption or salvation because he is a good man who does not shirk from the weight of difficult missions and onerous responsibilities. However, in the midst of what appears to be an utterly mad task by his crew, we do wonder if any of them are transformed in a positive way? We know from the opening moments of the film that Private Ryan himself lived the remainder of his life with doubt as to whether the risk to save him and the cost to the small band of soldiers was worth the price paid? Carrying the survivors guilt heavily upon his shoulders, Ryan greatly struggles to lift the doubts as he confronts Miller's grave. It is a question that Spielberg leaves in an ambiguous state, left for the viewer to contemplate.As a drama I found the script believable, even if within the confines of a very important battle it stretches credibility to imagine that it could have happened. I do not know if it is in whole or partially based on a true story. I just had to accept that it might have happened even if far fetched. Spielberg has almost no peer as a story teller in film. I am reminded of the moment in the film where Miller thinks he has found the correct Pvt Ryan, proceeds to tell the hapless soldier the bad news, sits and watches him take the news with a wincing pain and then finds out he has the wrong man. The emotional roller coaster is incredibly wrenching to watch and think about. The actors handle it superbly and to Spielberg's credit, once the point has been made the scene moves on, with the story lurching forward to the point, the finding of Ryan.The special effects have been the subject of much praise. I'd have to say that the opening sequence is about as shocking and gruesome a depiction of war in it's ferocious misery as you can imagine. It sets the tone for what is to come; much close at hand battles and a lot of people dying. As the great Civil War Union General Sherman was known to have said: "You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it?." and "There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all Hell." These sentiments overhang the entire movie and limit the usual tendency of Spielberg to drift into sentimentality. We are given enough of an immersion into the gore of war and all that remains is hell.The movie wants to focus on Tom Hanks and from some points of view it does. However, I think that this is the obvious reaction. You watch this film a few times and you begin to notice how many fascinating and well developed characters come to life. There is so much room in this film to be inclusive and generous with character development and Spielberg takes full advantage. Even the German soldier that Miller saves (another soul saved at the least opportune time, in the most surprising of circumstances) remains much more than a cipher. He returns to duty and the duty is to kill Allied soldiers. Was Miller a dreamy fool, a morally rigid person? Why did he let the soldier go free when the battle had cost him a very valuable soldier in his unit? What is Spielberg saying here? Why save this man's life and also save Pvt Ryan's life? It is left unexplained and even as that characters resolution comes, we are left scratching our heads, wondering what to make of it. I think that ambiguity is appropriate for the madness of the battle. When in extreme moments of great stress, people often reach decisions that they would never consider if posed in a quiet moment. All of this sits firmly within the overall question that hangs over the film. Should Pvt Ryan be saved and at what cost? Should the German soldier not be saved and why shouldn't he have been taken prisoner to be given over to authorities later on? In one his strongest and finest roles, surrounded by outstanding actors who all deliver 100%, given a huge landscape full of boffo special effects, Tom Hanks carries an important film forward into a tragic but believable ending. War is the great leveler and who survives and who dies is an imponderable question. Coming away from this emotionally draining film, we do wonder. A classic, worthy of all it's awards. Stick around for the credits as John Williams ends the movie with a very stirring choral piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Judge or Not to Judge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen depicting the moral dilemmas man struggles with during wartime. I have seen this film about 10 times and it still impacts me in the same way. The bonds of brotherhood run deep, but seems to be squad deep. The squad led by Captain John H. Miller, played by Tom Hanks, struggles with the question of "Why do they have to risk their lives to save the life of one man." This struggle continues to become more painful with the loss of each man killed in the "line of duty." Miller's statement, "I just know that every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel." Give a glimpse into the emotional toll war has on the human mind and soul. This struggle seems to overshadow the deeper struggle Cpl. Timothy P. Upham has with the right the rest of the squad has with being judge, jury and executioner when dealing with a lone German soldier after being taken prisoner. After "befriending" Upham he wins freedom from execution, but this in turn comes back as a haunting reminder of the possible consequences of mercy in wartime. I found the scenes revolving around the return of the German soldier and his disregard for the men who offered freedom instead of execution to cause me to think about how I would have reacted. Upham's struggle with fear was painful to watch, but more painful was the realization of what his inaction had caused. The transformation of the man, from compassionate, concerned human being to judge, jury, and executioner. As the German soldier reminds him that they are friends and again pleads for his life, Upham asks him "What is my name?" After he answers Upham kills him. What went through Upham's mind? I can't help but wonder if he would have spared his life if he had not remembered? By remembering his name does the German soldier make a statement about his disregard for the gift of freedom he had received? I cannot help but wonder how I would react when presented with the same dilemma. To judge or not to judge, the choice to take human life or not, using rational means to justify one actions. The struggle to maintain ones humanity during war must be one of the greatest struggles man endures. So what do we do with the scripture in Matthew that says, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." ?????</fullReview>

Also, moving scenes like, George Marshal reading Abe Lincoln's letter helped add to the drama of this film. Another excellent part of this movie was John William's dramatic and chilling soundtrack. Songs like "Hymn to The Fallen" left me in tears. Also, sensational acting by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns was another major factor in this film's success.

		<fullReview>"Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much, my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is I get back to her, and how I'll ever be able to, tell about days like today. Ahh, Ryan. I don't know anything about Ryan, I don't care. The man means nothing to me; he's just a name. But if, you know, if going to finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well then, then that's my mission"I am sure other reviewers who have reviewed 'Saving Private Ryan' (SPR) have rated it as the "Best War Movie Ever Made"" and I agree. To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg used all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Greatest things about SPR are first of all the sensational, highly awarded and celebrated camera work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too. That's what makes the film such a thrilling, vivid and incredible experience.It puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to "out there" and puts him/her go through this hell and every nightmarish detail that's part of it. Other marvelous thing is a good story, little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have. That's what keeps the movie interesting all the way.SPR is just outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours). Also one of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. A brilliant innovation is the color reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.The storyline is a real strength and the characters &amp; acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad. But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one life. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered "brothers" in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, "Steamboat Willie" humanizes the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. Another historical inaccuracy people have noticed is the Church tower in Ramelle which, according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but I don't think it will detract from the film. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context. Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words: "James... earn this. Earn it." The question this film poses is: Is it truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person???? This is the same question which Private Reiben asks to Hanks. The whole dialog go like this: Pvt.Reiben: "You want to explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?"Capt.Miller: "Anyone wanna answer that?"Medic Wade: "Hey, Reiben think about the poor bas***d's mother." Pvt. Reiben: "Hey, Wade, I got a mother, you got a mother, the sarge has got a mother. S**t, I'll bet that even the Captain's got a mother........ Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have got mothers"You have a great weekend!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect Movie for showing the evidence of WW II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this movie is one of the least movies which succeeded in describing the Brutality of World War II from both sides The Axis forces &amp; the Alliance forces, thought Hitler was really magnificent in making a Real Strong Defence Bases in Normandy &amp; in all the countries whom he entered.But there is only something which I think it is not realistic, it is the story of the movie. I do not think that in this war &amp; people are dying everywhere, I - Alliance Forces - would risk the lives of a good party like John Miller's party to save one soldier behind the enemy lines - not any enemy, it is the Hitler forces - though there were millions who might be saved in the Airborn event.It may be taken from a real story, in fact I do not know, but overall It's an excellent movie I recommend it for anyone who wants to see the World War II realistic...Thank you very much...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think the movie was good, i did but the problem came at the very end where you see Ryan standing at the graveyard and then the Stars and stripes in the background... i think it was to much, it is too patriotic and it was saying "war is horrible, we know, but you do it for your country and we will remember you" the problem is... you won't. and that is why i think if he had kept the style about war being a bad thing it would help us realize that we must seek peace instead of warfare, so that you will not end up crying on a battlefield with your best friend in your arms.S?ren Iversen 16 Yo.

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan starring Tom Hanks and an all-star cast was one of the best war films I've ever come across. It's mixture of violence, gore, drama and brotherhood between the 8-man unit was a different view of World War 2. Most war films just get stuck into random violence and don't take the time to explore the lives and views of the soldiers fighting for their country and their allies. With Private Ryan (Matt Damon) loses his three brothers in other parts of the world, Miller's (Hank's) unit must track him down to bring him back home.Almost immediately Carpozo (Vin Diesel) is killed and the mission takes an ominous turn. After a false alarm, the team finally finds Ryan but not before their medic Wade is killed whilst trying to capture a German machine gun battery.At the end of the film, after a large battle, most of the squad is annihalated and Hanks is hit by two German bullets which, in the end, terminate his life. But his mission was accomplished, Ryan survived, along with Upham and Mellish.A great war film and a must see for any War film-loving fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the Academy was drunk when the voted Shakespere in Love Best Picture over this masterpiece. This movie was my favorite movie for many reasons. First of all, this is a lot better than The Thin Red Line. Saving Private Ryan had great acting from pretty much everyone. Tom Hanks should have won Best Actor for this film. His performance was excellent. He plays Captain John H. Miller. He acts strong in front of his squad to set an example for them, and he hides his emotions from them. He makes brave and stupid decisions during war, but his performance was great. Tom Sizemore did a great job in this movie along with Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, and pretty much everyone else. Paul Giamatti had a cameo in this movie. Cpt. Miller and his squad must go behind enemy lines to rescue paratrooper James Ryan, who's three brothers died in combat. In my opinion, this is Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement, and Tom Hank's best performance. I give everyone my highest recommendation, though the violence may scare people away. No doubt my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan has one of the best performances by all characters, while still signifying war as a bloody, gruesome and meaningless battle.The movie, unlike many other war movies (The Great Raid), or even (Pearl Harbor), Saving Private Ryan follows a group of soldiers, on a mission to save Private Ryan. The fighting scenes are very accurate, and very gruesome. Saving Private Ryan is not one that drags on, but one that you enjoy the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes. Tom Hanks has done a great performance, as well as all the others. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest master pieces.</fullReview>

The film's gore, language, among other vulgarities are extremely well represented, but it is the end that got me.During the final scenes of the movie, when Hanks and his men have fought a hard and difficult battle, Hanks' character John Miller has been mortally wounded and dies in the arms of one of his soldiers; incidentally, the man he and his squad rescued, James Ryan. Ryan returns to the grave of his superior officer years later, salutes, and the legacy of a heroic soldier remains, though he has been dead for decades. A film that made me weep like never before.

		<fullReview>Possibly, Spielberg's seminal work. I don't think that there have been any of his movies worth watching since Saving Private Ryan. This film was made at a time when Spielberg had great ideas, and knew how to utilize the camera without selling out completely to Hollywood standards. Nevertheless, Saving Private Ryan is very much Hollywood, but that being said, it's a very eloquent rendition of that.If you remember anything about war movies, it's the anti-war ones that make a difference and are the ones remembered. I firmly believe that Saving Private Ryan is up with the best of that genre: namely Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.Tom Hanks plays his role marvelously. He is forced to act as a liaison between his crew's demands with the orders given to him, and it is certainly isn't an easy task. This movie is probably one the most accurate vignettes of the American World War II experience yet made.RATING: 9/10 "Please tell me that I am a good man, and that I have lived a good life" ?

		<fullReview>This film is a heartbreaker, because 53,000,000 men died - all over the world - to prevent that deadly stunning Omaha Beach battle. Yet, came The Korean War; the attempted invasion of Cuba; The Vietnamese War; The Gulf War; The Somalian War (we turned-tail and ran); that mess in Afghanistan (which has never been conquered); and now the fiasco in Iraq, the cradle of civilization as we know it. There's a tale making the rounds that our president was upset because "they tried to shoot my Daddy", he wanted to get Sadam. Hmmmm.....how many times do you think we've tried to do that? Doesn't assassination go with leadership?"Saving Private Ryan" should have been a graphic lesson that all wars are useless bravado AND "hell"- except for those who win ! - because it is inhumane for one sovereign country to attempt to dictate to another. An anonymous commentator wrote "let's hope that this is the last war." Have they been living in a vacuum for a couple of generations, or perhaps too young to have experienced the horror of wartime? Perhaps WW 2 was supposed to be "the war to end all wars," but that completely dismisses man's inhumanity toward man. Some races just don't like other races, as we are seeing in Iraq - and they all are from the same race ! If you can read between the lines of the headlines today, the next war will be over the lack of water or a specific religion.....or some belligerents idiot will launch an atomic weapon that will destroy life as we know it. If that is going to happen, please let me know when so I can get right under it.No one has mentioned watching "Into the Breach", which depicts the basic training-period the actors were forced to go through.....just like regular "grunts". One of the actors stated he would not do that again. All of them hated it, but all of their roles were greater for having experienced it."Saving Private Ryan" is near perfect in all ways, acting through direction through casting through cinematography through realism. My opinion is that Tom Hanks underplayed his role to make a point that ordinary men usually get the biggest responsibility in battle. It's "the grunts" who do the fighting - the bigwigs are behind in a safe area: "Blackhawk Down" serves as a perfect example. Sizemore WAS the seasoned warrior, and played his role superbly. Barry Pepper (in an entirely different role than in "The Green Mile") gave us a believable soldier who took his fighting seriously, but asserting "The Lord in My Shepherd". Masterful. Matt Damon was brilliant, as he is in all of his roles; his statement "these are the only brothers I have left" was a natural turning to those who had become his brothers. "Upham" made me cry, because I understood his cowardice - he didn't try to hide it - it was palpable. Quite frankly, I didn't recognize Ted Danson, quite a star in his day, in the film. Spielberg knew what he was doing, and did it.The most specific demonstration in this movie is how different the fighters in "Saving Private Ryan" are from modern-day fighters: "Jarhead" will show you that. Recruiting our youngest men to become killers is criminal - except, some of them have no other route to make their way in our world.We needed this movie - to remind us that we are on the way to a collision with the rest of the world. Brits decried they were not part of this battle - they were up at another beach, being killed just as brutally. All of the countries involved made the same sacrifice. Our Memorial Day honors all of those who lost their lives for freedom. If we are looking for movies to merely demonstrate what a great sound-system we have, that's pitiful.Until another ones comes along, "Saving Private Ryan" IS the best war-picture we've had - everyone should see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war film since "Platoon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As well as praise,this film also received a lot of criticism at the time of it's release because of it's pro-American view.so what... This IS an American financed film,made BY American's,FOR American audience's with American actor's and the beach landing on Omagh were done BY American servicemen. I can't see why SPR should be snubbed at because of this,It wasn't the first and won't be the last war film to be made from an American point of view."Saving private Ryan" is an excellent war film and deserve's it's billing as one of the top 10 war movie of all time.The opening Omagh beach landing scene's are horrifically realistic,showing the viewer as best a film can what it must of been like for those men on that fatal morning in June 1944. When them landing craft ramps went down all hell broke loss and the US Rangers were just cannon fodder for the German's up above in their machine gun bunker's. A lot as been said about the miss-leading of the Normandy beach landing scene in the beginning of SPR,Some Viewer's of the film say that the overload operation lead by the British,Canadian AND American's were not as blood thirsty as has portrayed in this film. Yes this true,It is a fact that only 1 out of every 7 allied soldiers actually fired a weapon on D-Day. But Omagh was as chilling as it is seen in SPR.After the first 30 minutes of one of the most graphically violent battle scenes ever witnessed on screen the film moves onto it it's main story.8 soldiers lead by capt Miller on a mission to find a private in the 101st airborne division lost somewhere in Normandy so that he can return him home to his mother after the US top brass as learned that three of her sons have just been killed in combat.A bit of a PR mission so to say. Through the mission the GI's tell us of their views of the war and the mission they are on(whats the point of risking eight lives to save one?) Some are killed in combat along the way as they meet German opposition raising the pointless of the mission with anger among the men.Till they eventually find pvt Ryan who as hooked up with another platoon that are defending a bridge that the Germans want for their counter attack.All this lead's to a grand finale battle between the American GI's and the battle hardened waffen SS inside a bombed out Normandy village.The battle scenes in SPR are authentic enough ,first on Omagh after a pinned down onslaught the rangers make easy pray of the German troops,This is because the German regiment's along the Normandy coast were mainly made up of eastern European conscripts captured from German occupied territory in the east and forced to fight by the Nazi's in German divisions.Hitler thought the main landing zone for the allies would most likely be Calias.So the front line worriment were stationed there. But in the final battle scene in this film the GI's faced much more resilient opposition in the form of the SS who we see give the American's a real fight.(The GI's are only saved from being wiped by the SS thanks to an air attack on the German line by P51's)All in all "saving private Ryan" is an excellent movie if you like bloody all out war battle scene's.The director Steven Spielberg brings the killing scenes right up close to the camera.The script is OK but can be a bit sentimentally at time's(trying to reason war through the eye's of Spielberg..in dialogue from the characters by the way)but this isn't enough of a problem to spoil the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 1998! One of Spielberg's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may not be as good as 'Schindler's List', but this is still probably the best war film ever made! Spielberg has made the film with graphic war detail, and this can possibly be one of the best films ever made as well as being one of the greatest war films. One thing I don't understand doesn't have anything much to do with the film, it's more the question of why in hell did it loose the Best Picture Oscar to 'Shakespeare in Love', which was a rather mediocre film! This, on the other hand, is the peak of film-making; it just doesn't get much better than this! The film starts off at Omaha Beach, during 1944 on D-Day, when thousands of soldiers were brutally killed by the Germans. It seems during the lead-up we feel as if this battle won't be too bad, but as soon as the landing craft lands on the beach, we are in the middle of the action, in the crossfire of the war. Soldiers dying all over the place, and barely 5% surviving the event! Spielberg has used perfect camera angles and just uses sound effects with no music to give it an extra touch of realism. After the events of D-Day the Americans back home discover that the there were 3 casualties in the Ryan family, and there is only one more Ryan brother left, and in hostile territory with little odds of surviving. Now a platoon that survived Omaha Beach, lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who will now be sent into German territory to find Private Ryan and bring him home so he can spare his mother of loosing all her sons. Now the greatest danger for eight men is saving one man! Now the story thickens as the platoon travels through hostile territory, attempting to find Ryan so they can all go home.The story is surprisingly excellent for a WWII film, Spielberg has guts to make a fictional story set during events that have already happened. The way he has blended fictional and true events together and created something that feels so realistic! The realism of the death of soldiers is excellent, the make-up DESERVES the Oscar it was nominated for! I also admire the way that Spielberg took away some of the colour to give it a WWII type style, it worked brilliantly. The cinematography was also outstanding, a worthy addition to this mix.The cast is another thing that makes this film so great, and same with Spielberg's directing. Spielberg certainly deserved his Oscar he received! And also Hanks was just terrific as Capt. Miller, also other members of the cast like Damon and Sizemore, all the elements of the film combine together to make an amazing movie.10/10, this would have to be one of the best films ever made! You MUST see this film!</fullReview>

While not sentimental it is extremely powerful. Undoubtedly the Best Picture of 98""Spielberg's direction, is so incredible in this film, that makes the film so real it is unbelievable""One of the few war films that portray war as accurately as possible.

		<fullReview>Everything in this film is perfect. It's hard to criticise this movie.Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role of Captain John Miller, a Ranger in the American Army sent behind enemy lines with a small band of soldiers, each unique in their own way, to retrieve a private from the 101st airborne who's 3 brothers had been killed in the previous weeks.Saving Private Ryan is an amazing insight into the "soldiers war" with heart gripping scenes such as the opening landing on Omaha beach. It leaves you feeling overwhelmed and humble. One of the superb things about this film is that it manages to create a sort of relationship between you and the individual soldiers.This is by far one of Hank's best films yet, and a true masterpiece from Spielburg. You will not be disappointed with this. The camera work is outstanding, with shots seen through the eyes of a moving soldier. Every directorial aspect of this film draws out the horror and suffering experienced by so many young men during the War.There is none of the cliché "American Hero" bravado you tend to see too often in Hollywood. SPR shows the young boys of America at their ultimate test. It shows the darker, personal side, when a grown man cries and crumbles in the face of danger. A "must see"..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the best war movie ever, both in terms of story and visuals. No other war film has managed to convey the constant hell that was World War II whilst at the same time illustrating the bonds of comradeship between soldiers quite so effectively and movingly. The film manages to be realistically graphic in its depiction of war and its associated death and injuries, without being gratuitous with the claret. No punches are pulled.The story opens with the D-Day landings on Omaha beach, filmed with brutal realism, and then moves on to the mission of eight men who go behind enemy lines to rescue one man. Each of the men begin to question their orders, their place in the war, and the cost to their humanity.The film won countless awards for its realism and its harrowing story, including Steven Spielberg garnering the Best Director Oscar. At the same time however it never tries to present itself as historical fact, rather a historical scenario with a fictional story placed on top. The main mission may be fictional, but the sub-plots (such as the importance of defending the bridge) are definitely based on fact. Tom Hanks is superb as Captain Miller, the man assigned to lead the retrieval unit sent behind enemy lines. Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel all provide competent performances as brothers-in-arms, and Tom Sizemore is (unusually) the rather understated Sergeant. The men form a strong bond (a bond between men which would Spielberg would explore further with his Band of Brothers mini-series) whilst undergoing a dehumanization process with regards to their enemy. Matt Damon has little more than a cameo as the eponymous Ryan. The film is both moving and gripping, and the 150-minute running time is barely felt, such is the intensity the subject matter is dealt with. Further, such was the impact of the film that several scenes (in particular the storming of Normandy beach) were almost shot-for-shot recreated in the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The apparent waste of resources on this rescue mission (a waste which is highlighted and questioned by the soldiers in the chosen unit) is not only a poignant story but also serves to highlight the sheer frustration of the waste and pointlessness of war in general. Together with Schindler's list, Steven Spielberg has created two films which are probably the finest monument to the Second World War and its atrocities of modern times, and with these also cements his place as the finest director of his generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a large fan of war movies, I can easily say that this is the most realistic war movie I have ever seen. The sequences of battle, though gruesome, convey the horrors and intensity of combat surrounding World War II. Though the story is fictional, the invasion of Normandy was depicted accurately and powerfully in great detail. Mechanical and historical accuracy is evident most of the time. In the movie, Private James Ryan is a paratrooper during World War II. During the invasion, he is mislaunched and lands near a small French village. He has three brothers who are also fighting in the war that have been killed in action. When the commanders of the army realize this, they order a rescue unit to retrieve Ryan and bring him home so that his mother does not have to receive word that all of her sons have died in combat. The leader of this unit is Captain John Miller (portrayed by Tom Hanks.) The performances by him and the rest of the people he commands is outstanding and the drama of the war is not underdone or overdone. For those people who negatively criticize this move due to its gore should realize that World War II was like that and the facts are being shown as they are. They have not been tampered with which is an excellent thing. Spielberg combined his past experience with superb acting, special effects and history to create an incredible tapestry of absolute cinematic brilliance. Easily the finest war movie ever created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that many films have actually been realistic in showing the how utterly disturbing and horrific experience that war is. "We Were Soldiers" was utter propaganda nonsense, as was "Black Hawk Down" which solely focused on violence. "Windtalkers" and "Tears of the Sun" weren't great either. They didn't try and focus on how utterly disturbing and disgusting the war was, no; they tried to create action-films to be viewed purely as popcorn entertainment and on some levels they succeeded. But Saving Private Ryan was a bar above the rest; a disgusting, realistic, beautiful attempt to show how horrible the war was, also showing as an entertaining movie too. When it's Spielberg, you know it's business.After a stomach-churningly horrific opening 20 minutes, in which limbs are torn and guts are spread across the beach, the film gets right to the point. With one of my favourite actors, Vin Diesel, in the team, they set off after orders to find James Ryan (Matt Damon) as per instructions given to them by an army base. This disturbingly realistic film really shows what hell war is. Not just in the fight scenes (after the first one on the beaches of Normandy they are infrequent) but what depths men have to go in war to complete the task given to them (i.e. trudging on in all conditions) and it realistically portrays the madness of it all. Only Platoon and Apocalypse Now have had anywhere near the effect.Horribly graphic and Tear-jerkingly beautiful, Steven Spielberg creates another timeless masterpiece that will assure that the full 161 minutes stay in the memory for a long, long time.Overall: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very powerful depiction of real wartime action; gore minimized however.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan received accolades from the U.S. Armed Forces for its realistic depiction of D-Day. Common sense dictates that they could have gone for lots more bloody-stump scenarios without violating the prerequisite of "realistic". The fact that they made a profound statement and didn't go that route speaks well of this movie project.Anyone who desires to serve their country by going into combat should watch this one. The ideal of "Glory of Battle" would quickly be dispelled. Real warfare is gross, sickening, chaotic, disgusting, tragic. It must be a last resort, and one's motivation should be a very deep sense of commitment to the cause of democracy. Not freedom to do whatever one "feels like", but a concept of humanity that says everyone has intrinsic value. This is what our theocentric founders had in mind when they drafted the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.Tom Hanks...and a fine cast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed, reading the reviews that a lot of the negative comments are complaining that certain scenes aren't as good as similar ones in other movies.It's a great movie. You can't just say that because certain parts aren't as good as another movie that this one is bad. O.K. so what if it has been a little Hollywood-ized? (Is that right? :S) Aren't most movies?It's like some people think "I'm not gonna like this movie" before they actually watch it, so all through they're just picking any pointless little thing to bitch about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to says is that ABC deserves awards for showing an uncut version of this superb epic on Veteran's Day. ABC did this despite any possible FCC stuff coming back at them. 66 affiliates got scared. When you watch the movie, which you can't really call a movie, you don't even notice the language because it PUTS you in the middle of Southern France in June of 1944. Veteran's Day needs to be honored like Memorial Day in this country, as a real holiday, not some holiday like Lincoln's Birthday. People fight for our country and have died for it virtually every day for 3 years, the Persian Gulf, and of course the countless numbers from Vietnam, the forgotten war, Korea, and WW2 which is beyond well represented in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it my excess of cynicism or my tradition of dislike for anything Spielberg (or are they the same thing?) that leads me to wonder why there's so much hype about Saving Private Ryan?Sure the battle scenes are grippingly shot, but not more so than Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' was more than a few years back, and more annoyingly for all the MTV camera tricks, like strobing and tacky colors out of old Life magazines. Sure the sets and scenes are done up perfectly, with lots of expert consultants on hand, just as in Schindler's List, which seems to be the WWII partner movie to this one. (Must be another one on the way; Stone had three on Vietnam.) And sure the cast delivers up solid performances, led by Tom Hanks who breaks as far out of his light comic mold as his very respectable talents allow.But you can't forget it's Spielberg. The assault on Normandy is the meat of the story, just as the concentration camps were in 'Schindler.' But again, Spielberg can't just tell it. He make a sandwich, wrapping the meat with his specialty: white bread. As in 'Schindler', present-day survivors -- in modern color -- visit the graves of the dead who so bravely gave, or at least risked, their lives that others might live. In case your head is impervious to Spielberg's hammer, the deal is that the living owe it to the dead to prove they deserve the gifts of life and liberty.Get it? We owe it (BANG) to the greatest generation to be "good people" (BANG). That's right, because (BANG) we are Private Ryan! (BANG BANG BANG)Of course Spielberg being Spielberg, he leaves us with a reassurance rather than a challenge. Based on his wife's affidavit and his family's all-American good looks, our avatar turns out to be well-deserving.And so are we all, everyone! Now we can sink back into our smug torpor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good picture with unfortunate ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great film, however, I think the message of the film was to try and relay the waste and horror of war. This message was clouded by the typical Hollywood ending. To have a Panzer Division obliterated almost instantly by a couple of P-51's and to have dozens of German ground troops surrendering to the nerdy translator was very unrealistic, and typically American. The film would have served a better purpose if Hollywood had not insisted that the calvary once again saved the day. Had Ryan been captured at the end to become a prisoner of war would have allowed the film to maintain the Old Ryan/Young Ryan plot without all of the last minute heroics which made a very powerful film somewhat cheaper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hmm, Steven Spielberg was as phenomenal as usual with the directing of this epic milestone, Tom Hanks's performance was as intriguing as it can get, all the characters had their separate uniqueness. Captain John Miller, played by Hanks is a retired school teacher who struggles to accept the reality he and his men are in, even though he hides his true emotions from his group, he afterwards shows his feelings towards the mission, Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) plays one of the most important parts in this film, he's the captain's closest friend and companion, his respect towards the captain is more than acceptable, Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns) is the desperate soldier who shows his frustration and anger towards the mission, and another guy, Private Jackson (Barry Pepper) is the silent and confident sniper, his character is to me the best in the film, part of it is because of how he praises The Lord while blowing the Germans away. It all gives the viewer a sense of belief. The story characterizes the true monstrosity and utter horror that is war. Especially WW2, until i saw this did i realize the importance of knowing what our heroes went through every day then, something to admire. Plot, Cast, (only minus was the apparently non-existent allies) but nevertheless, great film. The large content gives the viewer an overwhelming view of reality and how gruesome people can be during war time, its an emotional film and definitely one to remember. 10/10.</fullReview>

I bought the DVD to see a good movie, and I got a good movie. A movie with touching emotion, gory battle scenes, and an unrealistic tragic plot that warms the heart.That's what I'm looking for. Now, while I'm not asking you politically correct legions to change your minds about how you perceive this movie, but for heaven's sake, how fun/touching/whatever this movie is has nothing to do with how many non-American soldiers are included.Get off the "let's hate America" boat. Just because some loser thinks going to war for oil is fun doesn't give you licence to insult Americans who did die for a good cause. (No bad feelings meant for those who do give the American soldiers in WWII credit.)And for the record, I'm not American, nor have I ever set foot on European nor American soil.</fullReview>

The photography the scripts the acting the visual effects are all 100% brilliant, in both these films. Saving Private Ryan is about one man( Tom Hanks ), leading his troops into the depths of war; to save Private James Ryan ( Matt Damon ), and bring him home to his desperate mother. A warning to all those people who can not handle GRAPHIC WAR scenes, this is the most horrific and brutal war movie ever made. It depicts war at its worst. This film will make you think twice about supporting 'any' war at all. However Spielberg directed this, will be a mystery to me; it looks SO REAL. Tom Hanks is brilliant, 'as always' along with an up and coming actor who steals the show BARRY PEPPER, he is most powerful.I advise people who want to see a 'master at work' see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!!!!!Paul</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For sure one of the most realistic war-movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving private Ryan is according to me one of the most realistic war-movies ever made. In the beginning of the movie we see an old veteran visiting the graves of the people who lost their lives in an effort to save Ryan. In this movie we see the madness of war and the traumas which people carry all their lives with them. In this movie a group American soldiers get the mission to save Ryan because in his family already some brothers fell on the battlefield and the code wants that the last brother must be saved. This movie shows actually the madness about the fact that more people have to die for saving one life. The beginning of the movie is very realistic when the Americans reach Omaha Beach and i think that in that time it was like that because thousands of soldiers did not even have the chance to reach the beach but after a long battle the German defence breaks which meant the beginning of the Liberation. The Germans expected that the Allies should cross the Canal so the most troops were stationed over there which coursed weak points in the German defence at Omaha Beach. The actors like Tom Hanks delivered a very realistic movie about the madness of war which some personalities create in this world, even today. A 9 out of 10 they deserve for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is not a mindless charade of "the glory of war";it goes much, much deeper than probably any war film I have seen. It explores the fellowship of men banding together to save one private so that they ("can go home to (their wives)"), and the brutal obstacles they encounter, in the unpredictable situation of war. We witness an unforgettable, impeccable account of the most notorious siege in war history, "D-Day" in such personal, graphic, and unflinching detail that we find ourselves aboard the ships, swimming to the bloody shores, in the scorn of relentless battle. The direction throughout the film is superb: sincere, unapologetic, and poignant, as Spielberg takes us on a historical journey through the plights of these heroic men, and we witness every horror, every tragedy, and every act of courage which comprises the uncertain, the most fatal of situations, war. We are compelled by these soldiers' personal stories: their desires to someday return home and tell of their heroism to their grandchildren, to live happy, complete lives after this dangerous task. We are emerged into battle as the Americans and Germans are desperate and unrelenting in witnessing the others' demise, as this is the constant case of war. The ruins of the towns and its horrified citizens crying for mercy cause us to shudder with graveness and sympathy, as we encounter the unfortunate cost of war. The music is hearty and reverent, the sounds of the trumpets saluting those heroes, survived and fallen, and victims of war; from the brutal plights of battle, to the starking realization of survival being the only hope, to the grim deliverance to a mother a notice that her child has fallen in war; it is beautiful, passionate, and reinforces a theme of elegy prevalent throughout the film. This is one somber, reflective, and honest account of the last great war, and it is touching, engaging, and uncompromising in its infallible homage to a time of sacrifice and the men who comprise that honor. The best war movie I have ever seen. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in "Saving Private Ryan," one of the best war films ever made. Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers: Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James, who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once.The opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience. I have seen "Saving Private Ryan" many times and I always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me. It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. He continues to produce box office hits along with Tom Hanks and the legendary director Steven Spielberg. "Saving Private Ryan" is one film to watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the single best movie ever made, bar none. Besides being an absolutely exciting, realistic, moving, scary experience, it also manages to show the sadistic evil of the Nazis. The American Captain (Tom Hanks) is being ruined by the war, and he knows it. His hands shake more and more. Still he carries on. Ten Americans die to save one. It seems to make no sense except in that they do what they have to, regardless. It shows how hundreds of thousands of Americans died to save us, and the world.Every scene is a gem. Perfectly directed, acted, and staged. From Normandy beach, to the encounter with the German half track, and the final battle scenes, they are all perfect. There are a lot of great movies, but this is the absolute pinnacle. They should show this to all high school history students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is an art form, as well as one of the best movies ever made. Taking us on a journey from beginning to end, and attaching us to the characters in such a way that we feel true grief when they meet their end. Their may be inaccuries, but as in most films, they happen, and the story is told with merciless precision, and brutality. War is not pretty, it is death, and fear, and despair, and those who complain about the gore, should not have any say on this film, because that is the way it was. My grandfather was actually on Omaha Beach, and he saw his friend taken out by a mortar shell, and I have never seen my Grandfather cry, before he saw this film. The movie is great, the acting is flawless, even from Vin Diesel, and despiute what some dilweed said in another comment, I saw no clichés, and I have been critiquing movies for years.

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie that has not been said already? I saw it in the theater with my father and my grandfather who was in the US Armed Air Forces (8th) during WW2 and retired a Major to raise a family back in the US. The Army wanted him back for Korea but he had already served voluntarily since Pearl Harbor was bombed. Three of his brothers also served in combat and luckily all made it out alive. I loved this movie so much, it had the saddest but also happiest ending and so many terrific scenes in between. In the beginning we are not informed that the reason the US had so many casualties was due to errors made by those planning air drops and bombings, the troops should have had more support but the Armed Air Forces was apparently 50 miles up the coast from Normandy. The characters in this film are well formed and as a viewer you feel a connection to all of them. There are so many heroic actions and stories that came out of WW2, Saving Private Ryan, will remain a great one for all generations even if it is not based entirely on true events.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan will certainly be a film well-remembered for generations to come. But why? Perhaps because it took place during a crucial stretch of such an important conflict. Perhaps because it was so gory. Perhaps because Tom Hanks was in it. Who really knows?I like this film quite a bit. I sure as hell have never been in combat, but I'm sure this film paints a fairly realistic picture of it. If that opening footage of the Normandy invasion doesn't stick with you, nothing will. Talk about balls. Charging onto that beach. When I see these old timers that took part in this war, I always think of that scene, and wonder if that person was there or not. But overall, this film works best as an action film. It really does. I didn't connect on a personal level with any of these major characters. Maybe I wasn't supposed to. Maybe these characters were supposed to be just a metaphor for average joes from all over the USA. You have the Jewish guy, the hick who prays before he shoots, the tough-talking guy from Brooklyn, and the ambiguously ethnic guy (Vin Diesel) to name but a few. I just didn't get choked up when any of them died. Except maybe that poor little medic who died about half-way through. That was truly a sad scene.What I liked the most were the gun fights. They were truly exciting. At times I expected AHNOLD or someone to join in the fray. This action was compelling, but I think it robbed from the dramatic angle somewhat. The battle to take that bridge at the end was outstanding.This is a very good film to be sure, and it pays a fine tribute to the Americans who died in WWII. If nothing else, it's a hell of a lot better than The Thin Red Line. That film is AWFUL. It is an insult to those like my grandfather who served in the Pacific. Way too artsy to be taken seriously.Saving Private Ryan gets a solid 9 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film twice in the theatre and countless times on DVD at home. It never fails to incite deep emotion within me.The film is riveting as you follow the actions of 8 soldiers through Normandy as they try to find and retrieve Private Ryan.The opening scene on the beach although brutal and relentless is ultimately satisfying as the men eventually knock out the German positions and move inland. The cost is very high but they achieved their goal and have made the beach behind them safe.I must admit I never truly accepted the argument of whether or not it was right for the men to risk their lives to save Private Ryan. They were given an order (by General Marshall no less) and it must be carried out. If they weren't fighting the Germans to reach Ryan they would just have been fighting and risking their necks somewhere else in France.I can't think of another film that manages to bring the true horror and destruction of war right into your face. From the opening twenty minutes of the film right to the final battle the audience is never given a chance to rest or catch their breath.Great performances by several actors including Tom Hanks, it is a film that will surely be highlighted when Tom Hanks receives a lifetime achievement award near the end of his career. He is the calm and methodical everyman caught in the maelstrom of war and conflicting loyalties amongst the men he leads.Ironically I cannot bring myself to watch the final battle any longer. Here the sacrifices don't seem to lead anywhere and the action is so real I can almost feel it myself. Anyway an amazing film and truly a feather in the cap of Steven Spielberg as well.</fullReview>

Before getting all emotional, think about the far-fetched premise of the movie (and don't say it was based on a real story, the Sullivan brothers story is different after the first line), the silly fight between the (previously released) diabolical German and the Jewish US soldier, etc.Then go see some other good war films (Gallipoli and Das Boot are among my favorites).

		<fullReview>Ever since I was 12, I've read hundreds of books, seen dozens of movies and did almost anything that has to do with the second world-war. For me, this period of time which changed the world forgood has also changed my life and my view on the world as it is today. Almost 4 years into my WWII obsession, I heard about this project from the same director who made Shindler's list. Then the first screenshots... M1 carabines, MP40's and Tiger-tanks... I couldn't wait. Sitting there, in the pitch-dark, The movie starts with the absolutely great sound's from the orchestra lead by John Williams. Seeing the old man walking towards the huge graveyard, with his family on the background, with obviously increasing emotions, the camera hides behind one of the graves, not revealing the name on it. Fade out.What came next is almost indescribable. A group of extremely nervous American soldiers are standing in a landing-vessel, bouncing on the waves, a last walkthrough of the tactics&amp;objectives and then the words no-one wanted to hear: 30 SECONDS!! CLEAR THE RAMPS! Never ever had I experienced such an intense scene. I seriously totally forgot I was in a cinema. I felt like I was flying above the beach like a ghost. Absolutely uncomparable to any other scene I had ever seen.If I go on like this, describing all scenes, i would need 225 web-pages and 2 weeks to write it down. Since I lack the time, i'll give a short summary. From this scene on, Spielberg lets us join the march of some survivors, who are send by High command to find the youngest of 4 brothers, 3 of which died. He must and will return safely to his mother. We follow these soldiers, move with them and inside them. Encountering only some Germans (which, after Omaha itself, are all Waffen-SS which is weird, since the main force of the Waffen-SS did not join the fight until several days later). As the search for Ryan continues, so does the search for the answer to the question of questions... why do we fight? Spielberg brilliantly links the search for that answer to the actual deeds of all the individual soldiers. He shows, better than any director before, that soldiers are not blindly-orders-following-men, but individuals who are thrown into a war and fight it their own unique way. After a both sad and hilarious mistake, they finally manage to find Ryan.. who turns out to be unwilling to return home until he completed the task he and his team were supposed to do with the few remnants of his battlegroup. That task is to defend a small bridge in a small town -the only remaining bridge in the area- until reinforcements have arrived. Captain Miller is forced to stay and help until this objective is reached.The final battle that follows is again a masterpiece. Spielberg obviously wanted to reach the highest level of historical accuracy. Everything, from the socks they wear up to the tanks they fight, is historically correct (I must note that the Tiger-tanks are not real ones, but are in fact T-34 (russian) tanks converted to tigers- only the running gear gives this away, but hey, there are no real Tigers which move available up to today, so still great job). This final battle again shows the true horrors of war: all but 3 or 4 die.Alltogether, the mixture of hand-held cameras and static ones, the moving characters, the music, the brilliant storyline and the breathtaking action made this movie one worth of viewing 25 times up to today -and more often to come- for me. Even for those totally uninterested in WWII: Just go and see this one, with theatre-surround of course. You most certainly will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done combat movie from the maker of ET. I like the way the color is used in this. Not overdone and just grayish enough so that uniforms appear olive green hue instead of money or blade grass green. The opening sequences showing the GIs' taking bullets are probably as accurate as any filmmaker can get. Nevertheless these opening sequences seem to imitate and improve upon the opening sequences in Cornel Wilde's excellent "BEACH RED" from 1967. Both films exhibit harrowing and exhaustive combat openers showing beach storming American troops taking bullets in nearly every part of their bodies'. By showing blood and severed limbs and the like the audience is shocked into understanding the cruelties of war. Saving Private Ryan, or Beach Red for that matter, are not for the squeamish movie viewer. They are perhaps best enjoyed by those who've 'been there' and perhaps the most ardent war movie buffs..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>masterpiece! the best war movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it has been said a lot of times about this film showing the truth about war. yes, there are splattered blood all around. yes, some scenes are unbearable to some. yes, i saw that guy cry "momma!", and was disturbed by it. but it is war. here we see what soldiers undergo, what they encounter before we call the heroes, be it dead or alive. spielberg has a keen eye on detail, like the first part where the soldiers go underwater, where you could hear gunfire as the soldiers head goes above the water, then silence when underwater. i can't see anything wrong with it: the story, visuals, sound, all are top-notch. movies like this are what make directors legends, just like mr. spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality Check</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good thing about this film is the realistic depiction of the landing. Even that, though, comes off as patchy and episodic; you aren't really left with a good sense of what happened. When you consider Cornelius Ryan's book about D-Day, this is the polar opposite: there are no details. One minute you see people being blown up and floating in the water, then people getting their guts blown out on the beach, then the tanks are moving inland.Actually, to me, this film continues to have a core strength that is very interesting very far into the film. When I saw it, I was realizing that the ending was coming and I didn't hate it yet, and was frankly amazed. But then, all the cheese I expected of the Spielberg/Hanks combo came out with a vengeance in the finale. Steven Spielberg is a hackneyed stooge. He's lucky that he came up at the same time that the movies were turning into titilation machines. He'd have starved in the '40s. Five minutes of Orson Welles' worst film make his career look like a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie! Recommend to Band of Brothers fans..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie. I've seen it a couple times but appreciated it even more after watching the Band of Brothers series. In fact after watching Band of Brothers and seeing Saving Private Ryan afterwards I noticed that Ryan and his group were all part of the 101st Airborne Easy Company. They mention it a few times later in the movie especially when they first meet up with Private Ryan in the field. Interesting link. Probably why Tom Hanks put the Band of Brothers series together in the first place. I recommend Saving Private Ryan. Excellent effect and camera work! Put you right in the battle especially at the beginning of the film. Not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very accurate war epic, with a inaccurate storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a superb war epic that will probably be remembered in the far future, revising the Second World War very accurately. It begins with the title character, James Ryan as an old man surrounded by his family; whereby are visiting the grave of a very important person in Ryan's life. The film then very quickly takes a new approach, as we begin to learn the story of the beginning of the film, and just who this person is.Moving onto the famous D-day landing; an event that very few war films have portrayed, especially in such graphic detail, then moves beyond the beach, and through wrecked towns and cities in France. The film then progresses as the title of the film is explained, and new characters are introduced and lost, demonstrating the real horror of war.The film in general is about a solider, who has been unlucky enough to lose three of his brothers in combat, leading to a special, dangerous mission. Captain John Miller, (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, an American solider situated somewhere in France. The men question their orders, but continue to embark on the mission. As Ryan, becomes nearer, the mission becomes harder, and soon, most of the characters are suddenly killed, including Captain Miller, the name on the grave at the opening sequence of the film!Although very well acted, and involving a gripping story line, it is fair to say the story should be more realistic as this story is extremely unlikely to happen in the real World War 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good war movie - but too simple, straightforward and obvious to be regarded as a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A whole family of young men are killed on D-Day bar a front line solider (Private Ryan) who must be pulled back from the battle field for the sake of his poor mother.Steven Spielberg is a director that I feel is vastly over-rated. While I admit he has produced both classics (in artistic terms) and blockbusters (in commercial terms) is he really that good? Is he really able to rise above the budget, acting, technology or script? Does he believe in anything? Have a grand message for the world other than it is good to be rich and famous? A nice guy, sure, but so is my milkman.Call me a hard man to please, but I don't believe that Spielberg has put anything really new in the cinema pot and he has dipped in and borrowed plenty: Hitchcock, Scorsese, Kubrick and Kazan have all produced mini-masterpieces from nowhere with no stars or budget to speak of. Spielberg hasn't (although Juggernaut was above average for a TV movie).As has been said a thousand times before, the opening takes a first hand look at D-day and is quite brilliant, but when it ends the movie droops. It is then a bog-standard war-is-hell product with a lot of extra emoting and men-can-cry to show that we have turned the page. (Actually we haven't - many European films and B's have explored war from a first hand and more down-and-gritty viewpoint, but the mass audience haven't actually seen those products so they just think they are getting something new.)Tom Hanks is a great actor. He is the first and only modern star to play weak (or even stupid) and improve his box office standing. I praise him for it. No one could be better than him here, really bang on the money. But no one else needs to do much other than mouth words and Ryan (despite being the title role) is a star walk-on. I am glad I saw this film and I recommend it to you. But I wouldn't want to see it again no matter own it. Money has been well spent and its heart is in the right place, but at the end it wants to get you in a headlock and push emotions down your throat. Further proof - in my book - as to why Spielberg isn't really the master of his own game, just a little above average at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speilberg's WWII Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films ever. It starts off with the beach landing, which is so realistic. The sounds of the waves crashing onto the beach is magnificent. I love that bit. You would think it was an actual war on the T.V. The beach landing is gruesome! Arms being blown off, guts hanging out of people, soldiers being shot, people getting blown to bits etc. It is the most violent films ever. The story is about 8 (I think) U.S. soldiers that set out on a quest to bring Pvt. James Ryan back home after his 3 brothers were killed. On there Journey they have more firefights, which are again very violent.It stars, Tom Hanks (Capt. John Miller), Tom Sizemore (Sgt. Michael Harvath), Edward Burns (Pvt. Richard Reiben), Matt Damon (Pvt. James Ryan), Jeremy Davis (Cpl. Timothy E. Upram), Barry Pepper (Pvt. Daniel Jackson), Adam Goldberg (Pvt. Stanley Mellish), Vin Diesel (Pvt. Adrain Caparzo), Giovanni Ribishi (Pvt. Irwin Wade) and Ted Danson (Capt. Fred Hamill).And that's about it, I recommend Saving Private Ryan to any war film lovers.Rating - (10/10) *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing that Steven Speilberg has done has been half assed. But if i had to choose his best film this would be number one. The only thing that annoys me is all of the films that came after it about WWII. Sure some were good, but none were great. I just wished that they would stop following in Speilberg's footsteps, trying to top his film. Because it will never be topped. I am glad that this film was made when it was, because pretty soon there will not be anyone left who was there or even was alive during WWII, this is going to be the same in 100 years or so about September 11th. But not to stray off subject, this film was the most accurate depiction of D-Day I have ever seen. I don't need to go into detail about other reasons why this was great except to say that this is a must see, must own, must worship movie, that will remain timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Essay on Americanism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidden beneath the spectacular and involving action sequences in this film is Steven Spielberg's vision of just what it means to be an American. For Spielberg, its not just the flag-waving patriotism of the armchair soldier, but the true heroic notion of sacrifice for fellow man. Time and again during the battle scenes, we see his emphasis on the anonymous "dog face" who has given his own life to further their cause. Medics die saving the wounded. Others die saving children. And an entire mission is dedicated to save one man.The contrast is shown in the form of Corporal Upham, the tag-along interpreter, who has not yet learned this notion of sacrifice. His inaction in crucial moments sets him apart from the rest.Captain John Miller is the ultimate embodiment of Spielberg's theme. He is an uncommonly common man, as plain and unremarkable as his name, but with a steadfast sense of purpose, and humble in his brilliance. His final instruction to Private Ryan is a message to us all.While touched on in many of Spielberg's other films, this is his most consistent rendering of that belief. A magnificent film which should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan! This was one of the most authentically made World War II movies ever made. Tom Hanks did a fantastic job playing a soldier during WWII who did as he was told, regardless of how he personally felt about the task at hand. My husband retired after 30 years of Army service and loves to "critique" military movies (being a military buff himself). Even he was hard pressed to find a "mistake" in this movie! The movie takes you from the landing on the beaches to the impossible task of locating a single man, Private Ryan. In between the search for this man, we are delighted with excellent character development of the company sent out to search for Private Ryan. We are able to gain a little insight of what it might have been like for men of various backgrounds coming together and united for a single cause. Their banter, individual histories, prewar occupations, state of residence, &amp; individual thoughts made each character feel so real that by the end of the movie you felt like you knew them - they WERE real. Movies like "Saving Private Ryan" are wonderful for your adults to watch. Kids don't appreciate history or really take in the events they are taught in school. Movies such as "Saving Private Ryan" help to generate interest in history for the young. For the older population, we simply appreciate (or remember) the time period and feel proud of our spouse or a family member who served during WWII. Warning: have plenty of tissues by your chair for this movie!</fullReview>

In Behind Enemy Lines, Owen Wilson's character is funny and he shoots stuff and the special effects are outstanding. This movie is sort of dark at times on the screen and its hard to see sometimes. The beginning part was too bloody and I don't think that the is appropriate for some people because it grossed me out. Tom Hanks isn't very good in this movie, he seems like he doesn't even care about the movie. I would of cast Owen Wilson in the lead role, and if not, I would of tried to get Dennis Quaid. This movie was dissapointing and boring. See Behind Enemy Lines instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To many the story of Saving Private Ryan starts with the landings at Normandy and the incredibly realistic depiction of D-Day June 6,1944,however there is first the subtle and unexpected deliverance of James Ryan to the headstone of Captain John Miller whereby the story is told of a time past when something of what we love was lost forever.The emotional place where this very fine movie goes is to our ability here today to talk to each other as though this was merely a motion picture and not the roll call for our honored dead.Though we are through James Ryans eyes taken back to when Captain Millers company is approaching the beach head at Omaha in one of those Higgins boats we are drawn into perhaps one of the most incredible movie scenes ever done.It is almost to terrible to elaborate,however thats the way it is.I do not feel this was meant to be an anti-war theme however if you want to know what it was like or perhaps what it might be like this is a good film to watch.This is a no-holds barred look at that action.For the record,this landing zone was called Omaha,and I believe it was the most difficult of the 5 landing zones.However we did establish a beach head and as the dates of history will show within 1 year we were to meet with our Allies in Berlin.This is a unforgettable war movie that should not be missed.I will express only a reservation about some of the attempts at a protest position against war.The inability to properly put a prisoner of war permanently out of the action was not I believe worthy and when that big bad Nazi did that deed to kill one of our guys and was not killed as a result was cowardice under action.I think that was pretty bad and in fact cost us because he could of engaged the enemy before the enemy even went any where near the staircase.Some of the emotional purges seem very much over the top but it seems to provide a very convincing ability to convey the deadly seriousness of what we were involved in,when a voice says to Captain Miller,"thats quite a view,"and Miller says "yes it is,"That is when we get a view of what is forever lost,a sacrifice which on the field at Gettysburg,Pa Abraham Lincoln said that these honored dead should not have died in vain but gave there full measure so that we may increase our devotion and know a new beginning in defense of the republic.The banter is hard to predict but perhaps that was then this is now,however the final battle scene is hard to handle that was a very demanding challenge and boy did things heat up.Excellent war time footing and you dont loose concentration.I actually thought that If I could we would want God to know that we love each other for the bravery,honor,and life that we are being asked to provide so this Private James Ryan might know a future,and his decendents as well.If you had paid attention Jim Ryans family was there, children and all.A job well done Captain Miller,Thank You.To you Rangers of the Omaha Landings,my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan, a film that covers material that has been both harnessed and flauntered, is a rarity. Ryan, as a jarring, gripping war film manages to address and touch nine of the ten human emotions without losing site of the story. The film grabs you off the screen, as Tom Hanks plays the captain of a platoon, which, as noble, brave, and righteous as they may be, are nonetheless a band of young men. Capt. Jon Miller embodies the man whom we all would want to be - a courageous leader of men who has earned the respect of his subordinates - without blurring the fact that he is a man - one with a life outside such a hideous display of humanity. Very rare are movies where we follow a group of people and feel like we have gotten to know each and every one by the end - at least to the degree which the excellent script permits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies star in one of the best war films ever made. Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers Sean, Peter, Daniel, and James who fought in the war. What makes this so hard is that three brothers, Sean, Peter, and Daniel are casualties of war and the Ryan mother was to receive all three letters at once. The opening scene is one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film. Only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance it has on the film and the effect it will have on people. I saw "Saving Private Ryan" many times and I always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me. It was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as I did.Saving Private James Ryan turns out to become something more than what Capt. Miller had bargained for. Tom Sizemore is Miller's loyal right hand man Sgt. Horwath. Sgt. Horwath's loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way Sizemore portrays Sgt. Horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation. Wars are one of the worst tragedies of America and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me.The way Steven Spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eye-opening view into the real thing. At first, I hated this part since it was long and drawn out; but when I saw it the second time, I understood why it was done. Spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen. Matt Damon was superb as Pvt. James Ryan. He continues to produce box office hits along with Tom Hanks and the legendary director Steven Spielberg. "Saving Private Ryan" is one film to savour over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Ain't fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read enough of the comments on this film to know that they run the gamut from praiseworthy to apocriphal to derogatory. I'll go for the first one. I know this film isn't meant to be historically accurate, or even based on an actual event. The only truths are Normandy, the tone of the fighting, the region of the fighting, and the equipment and tactics. There was no real Pvt. James Francis Ryan with three brothers killed. But there was a Nyland family, four boys, three of whom were killed in WWII and one survivor, who was brought home. This is the basis for this movie, but since Nyland's homecoming was less than dramatic, Spielberg needed a bit more punch, And oh, Lordy, did he give it to us! I've seen hundreds of war films, from the sterling 'Gettysburg,' to the appalling 'Pearl Harbor' and all in between. But SPR is a truly realistic film. It does a splendid job of bringing the viewer into the horrible and frightening arena of modern foot combat, with the sounds, sights and fears experienced by the men who slugged it out in the fields, towns and hedgerows of Normandy in 1944. I'm not a veteran, but a lot of my friends are, and not one of them has been able to watch this movie without deep, profound emotions. One Vietnam veteran commented to me, after we walked, our eyes blinking in the bright sunlight outside the theater, "God, I never thought combat could ever be done on film the way it really was." He's right, God Rest his soul, now that he's gone to be with his buddies in Valhalla. The only thing missing in this film is the smell and taste, of mud, dirt, gunpowder, blood, sweat and tears. This movie makes you hate the cruel randomness of battle, the men who you've come to like, (Capt. Miller, Pvt. Jackson, Sgt. Horvath), and the ones you hate, (Cpl. Upham, the German who went back to fight) being killed in stunning moments and passing into memory like lightning flashes. The impact of bullets, the CRUMP! of mortars and artillery, the ear-ringing echo of near-misses, are all realistically shown. In a theater, I found myself ducking instinctively from whickering Mauser bullets whining past my head. I left the movie exhausted, emotionally drained, and deeply moved. And with even more respect for what Peter Jennings called 'The Greatest Generation.' Well, done, Spielberg, and well done, GIs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Quite A View"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Saving Private Ryan" the greatest war movie ever made? I don't think I've seen one better. If there is one better, I don't think I could manage to sit through it, anyway. Though it is intense, violent, and bloody, it is also entertainment, albeit of the profoundest kind. Even those viewers who normally pass up opportunities to be shocked and appalled by on-screen violence should not deny themselves the chance of seeing this great film at least once.People discussing this picture tend to agree on one thing: The Omaha Beach sequence that starts the story proper is the high point of the picture. I concur. It throws some awful imagery at the viewer, making you feel like you are a part of the landing. As bullets rip into the innards of men around you, you almost feel like you are in mortal danger. But the sequence works not because of the bloodiness, but because of the pacing. Despite the objections of some, director Stephen Spielberg doesn't push your face in gore unrelievedly, but creates a story in this sequence that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Spielberg makes you feel the human cost of the battle in some small way (he never pretends to be capturing all of it) but keeps the camera focused on characters like Tom Hanks's Cpt. Miller and Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Horvath who you feel are going to make it through at least this fight. Much of the carnage is shown in small flashes, or in the corners of the frame. At the risk of trivializing the actual conflict, the result is like a rollercoaster ride, a mighty daunting one that you feel some measure of achievement after you sit through it once, and actually grows more powerful with repeat viewings, which is not as horrible once you have seen it once and gotten a good idea who lives and dies.The rest of the film can only pale in comparison, and is often unfairly dismissed for losing some of the momentum of Omaha. But how could any director, however great, sustain such momentum? And who would want to?Instead, the film goes into a section that I think is even more affecting, when we see the typing pool where female clerks rattle out pro forma letters from "Joes" who speak in male voices about how each casualty was the finest and best soldier they ever had the privilege of serving with. Then one woman notices her letter is addressed to the same mother as another she just finished typing, and the central plot is set in motion. Three brothers have been killed in action, it turns out, and a fourth is missing in action and must be found. Harve Presnell as George C. Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recites from memory a letter sent by Abraham Lincoln nearly a century ago, in the process giving one of the most powerful performances in a movie full of them, and then we get a sequence that visually quotes Norman Rockwell as Mrs. Ryan wordlessly gets word of `the sacrifice she has laid on the altar of freedom.' Watching her collapse on her porch as the priest emerges from the black sedan is not easily done with dry eyes, because we understand by then how commonplace this sort of thing was.There are moments of humor in "Saving Private Ryan," too, much of it from Tom Hanks' central performance. His laconic comment when a German on a loudspeaker announces "the Statue of Liberty is kaput" is priceless, and even as the body count mounts, there is a sense of this somehow being made endurable by the company of Miller and his men. Hanks keeps his schtick in harness most of the time, but when he does allow for some jocularity, we are actually grateful.The film slips a couple of times, but not in any major way. The biggest misstep for me was when Miller goes off and cries after losing one man. It's the one episode of actorly indulgence in a film that otherwise steers clear of such theatrics, though it may work for others.Even the final battle for the town of Remmel, though fictional, is done in a realistic and committed way. Some of the most violent and gruesome moments occur here, and they are all the more difficult to endure because we now know the soldiers fighting and dying in a way we didn't at Omaha.The music by John Williams and the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski are simply brilliant, neither calling your attention as they serve their scenes in an efficient manner. The sound, the editing, all are of a high order and will no doubt inspire moviemakers for generations to come.People who say `Saving Private Ryan' is not war but Hollywood are right, but miss the point. This is an example of Hollywood getting it right, and creating something enduring. I will always be thankful I managed to sit through "Ryan" once, because it made me want to see it again. Give this film the same chance, and I bet you will agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does anyone remember seeing Saving Private Ryan for the first time? When it opened in summer 1998? Before all those good reviews and history teachers guilted you into watching it? Before it lost Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love?Most people, I think, don't. So much praise was heaped on this film on its initial release and so much outrage was expressed when it was passed over in favor of Shakespeare in Love, it's hard to enter this movie "clean" and with a fresh mind. It always surprises me when a fellow movie buff calls Ryan "overrated", and I can't help but think that they're judging this movie on its reputation rather than its quality.Yet watch Saving Private Ryan without the critical baggage: this is truly a great film. The much-discussed, stunning opening- and it is stunning- is followed by a war narrative that's every bit as good as Schindler's List. Anyone with a soul should have a powerful response to this movie, and positive or negative, there is little denying it is a testament to the profundity of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Saving Private Ryan displays the some of the many horrors and consequences people experience while at war. This movie is so good that it should be mandatory for people to watch this movie at least once. Don't like bloody war movies, then too bad. You still need to know what it was like for those many brave soldiers who encountered those harsh experiences. Saving Private Ryan delivers what should be just as close to what war is realy like. You'll be touched more than you've ever been touched by any other movie in your entire life.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How some people can be ignorant. I have no problem(Well, I admit I have some problem) with people who dislike great films because the films did nothing for them. I have an incredible lack of patience with people who dislike something and believe their lousy opinion actually means something. I love film. And I watch great films. And I have, at least, as much love for real movies as anyone here or anywhere else. And when I watch something that affects me like this, then it's a real movie. I saw this film twice in theaters and each time I missed the first 5-10 minutes. I missed the man in the beginning and I missed the beginning of the best war footage ever shot(By far. the scenes in Platoon and the helicopter scene in Apocalypse Now cannot even live up to this and those are among the greatest of all films). This film is an absolute Masterpiece. I rented the film when it came out and I've owned for a few years...Very few films have ever had the effect on me that this. It is one of the very best films ever made. It devastates me every time. And I have to say, I have an incredible incredible dislike for people who think they know about films. These arthouse freaks get to me(And I can be an arthouse guy, myself) when they not only dislike a film but when they TRY (But without knowing it fail) to take away from the meaning of the film for the people who were impacted by it. This isn't some dumb sell-out movie. This is not the Linkin Park of movies. Sorry to burst your bubbles wannabe film buffs, but Spielberg is, along with Scorsese, as good as it gets-BOTTOM LINE...If you don't feel the same way about his work, then I apologize because you are really missing out. Spielberg may be the most popular and most amount grossing (Interesting use of words) of all-time but he is a genius and the other geniuses(Scorsese, Kubrick, Coppola, Fellini, Leone, Eastwood, Stone, Lee, etc etc) feel the same way about him. So all you fools who not only dislike Steven's work, but label it as popular nonsense, go tell the directors you admire that one of their great heroes of the cinema is nothing but a joke. I always wonder how people will respond to that (Someone is gonna tell me they don't care what anyone else thinks, it's their opinion-Opinions are stupid).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE definative war film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dare you to find a better war film than this. It is the most historically accurate war movie there has been. The cast is top notch, with some of the biggest names taking all the parts, providing the best mix of people becoming a new family on the battle field. The plot is as real to life as any. The reactions potrayed by each actor to the near pointless mission they are sent on shows the contrast between the people sent to war, yet they all pull together and march to the beat of the drummer.To sum up, watch this film. If there was a list of film that had to be watched before you die, this would be number 1 on my list</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in a darkened theatre, i was destroyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Devastation - there are many things that can, and will, devastate a person in his or her life. Akin to the devastation of this movie going experience, in a darkened theatre, is the devastation of its lack of power, its lack of damaging, its lack of emotionally caving power, to destroy me, on home video release.in a darkened theatre my heart wept for every living man, who had to fight in any war, of any year in the existence of this world. The horror and the hollowvacuum that my heart was drenched and sucked into, during the first quarter of this film, was unlike anything that had ever become of me. The experience was in fact so upsetting and demanding of my soul, that i repeated it - once again on my own, and once more with a friend. And the beginning, THAT beginning, beatmy heart faster as it crept into the cut, to the past, to the horror, the second viewing, and once again, the third viewing. At this point, this movie was the only movie, and it stuck with me, and moved me so much that it was at this point, the most amazing thing i had ever witnessed.So why is it no longer even close to meaning as much to me?in a darkened living room, as it crept into the cut, my heart barely beat a beat faster - at home, in comfort perhaps, this movie did nothing - and becamenothing more than a Spielberg movie, with Tom Hanks trying to save MattDamon. All i could think, was how? How could this be released onto video, into thecomfort of homes, the comfort of bedrooms? Releasing this on video hasdestroyed the movie. I only pray that one day, i will own enough equipment, to bring the heart out of the magnetic tape, out of the glossy DVD, bring the pain beyond Tom Hanks face, beyond John Williams music - and once again watchthe ghost of a battle, that terrified and took so many lives, as it once destroyed me, in that darkened theatre.</fullReview>

The atmospherics and realism (I guess) of the battle scenes (Omaha Beach) was mesmorising and not equalled by other recent war films. And surprisingly for me, I felt that Hanks carried the role well - with another fine performance by Tom Sizemore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Personal Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it, I'm a big fan of "Saving Private Ryan." In my humble opinion, those who don't appreciate this movie are a bit too nit-picky. Some say it is an anti-war movie. Others call it "flag waving b@llsh*t." In truth I don't think the film was trying to be either, although you could feel the respect Spielberg has towards military veterans. Also, just because the movie doesn't portray everything exactly like it happened doesn't mean it lacks realism. I believe most people who saw the movie could relate to the characters and their displays of emotion. You could feel the fear in the battle scenes, the grief when Ryan's mother fell to the porch after seeing the chaplain get out of the car. You could relate to the homesickness of the troops who had gone months, if not years, away from home fighting a war on foreign soil. I have never seen another movie that had as large of an emotional impact on me as this one did. "The Thin Red Line" doesn't even come close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm stuck in Norway at the moment. These people just can't stop being ironic and ignorant and poppin' my chops over the Gulf War. Luckily, there was an article the other day about fine, T3, model chick, Kristanna Loken, and how she has a couple Norwegian roots. This was able to steal the wars attention.Anyway, the question is, after all the American war movies that have been coming out, how can you blame 'em for this anti-America, world cop crap.Some are just action movies in disguise, searching for reason and realism. Others are more serious and want to show us that war sucks. Right. Heard of that before.So, we're at war, fighting people all over the world. Something that often isn't clear enough is why are we fighting? The characters are heroic but robotic. They sloughter with no questions asked.Saving Private Ryan does ask these questions. The characters want to follow the system and obey their orders, but they can't help but question and doubt it. The military isn't a machine which is oiled and fueled. Soldiers are not robots. This is are army and it isn't perfect, but we're doing what we can and we're proud Americans.Besides this is WWII. The one war where we had support of most of these big European countries, so we don't need to explain to them what we're fighting for. Some of the other sides involved in this war even complained that we were hogging to much of the credit in this movie. That's when you know you're doing something right.So, we need more war movies like Saving Private Ryan because it gives you the naked thruth about the military. A relief. It will make you a man, not a robot. So, war movies should be walking in the footsteps of this masterpiece or we'll be coming up short on manpower.But the machines are taking over anyway, right? Just look at Arnie back down in Cali."My mission is to protect you."</fullReview>

Would ALIEN have been better if we had seen the film from the alien's view? The horror of war is that we DON'T know the enemy. They are faceless foes. In GETTYSBURG it made sense to show both sides since the entire battle was the point. In other films like DAS BOOT, the British are never shown close up.

		<shortDescription>WHY?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand some of the issues raised by people after viewing this movie. They seem to bring their own agendas.Some people ask why no Brits were portrayed.....why should there be? Okay, there were Brits (and Canadians etc) invading France....but what do they have to do with the efforts of an American squad ordered by American superiors to locate an American paratrooper who was with other American troops so he can be sent back to his American mother who had lost 3 other of her American sons. If the movie were about Brits fighting on Sword or Juno and some Tommy was lost inland and the Brits needed to find him to send him home to Liverpool or Dymchurch....I wouldn't moan about the film not showing Omaha Beach and Americans not being shown.Now, yes,there were Hispanic and Black soldiers there. Many blacks steered the landing craft. Spielberg COULD'VE added a black landing craft driver and a hispanic soldier blown to bits...but aren't we all a little tired of tokenism? I know I find the inclusion of a white character in "black" movies like DRUMLINE kind of cheap and pandering. Would the inclusion of a Hispanic soldier in the squad made it a better movie? Would the sight of a Hispanic soldier dying on the beach made it a better movie?And again, would someone please explain the comments about Germans being portrayed as stupid and/or evil? During the film, we see AMERICAN soldiers:Gleefully laugh as they shoot Germans attempting to surrender at NormandyA soldier so frozen with fear that he neglects his fellow soldiers in their time of needA soldier threatens to desert the squad and disobey his officersAnd what do the Germans do that's evil? They shoot Americans (no Brits) and they stab them and Germans manning tanks fire at Americans......that's not evil...that's WAR!Then people say that after the first half hour,that the movie becomes routine. Well, I don't get that. They are on a quest. Just like in LORD OF THE RINGS. We DID get to know each soldier. Not as much as the soldiers in a mini-series like BAND OF BROTHERS but then, did we really know more about them than the guys in SPR?If the entire movie were like the first half hour, some of you would be complaining that there wasn't enough quiet character development.And how could anyone say Tom Hanks is a bad actor?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's something I never quite get. People say that the German are made to look evil in WW II films...and I'll grant you that in some of the older ones they do. But where in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the Germans made to look evil?Sure, they look formidable and that uniform makes them look scary. But they are hardly portrayed as baby-eating, snarling sub-humans. They kill Americans but that is what war is about. I don't see any scenes of torture or laughing Germans as they gleefully kill our guys.Also, the plot was based on a real event. There was a brother pulled out because his brothers were lost. It might not have happened exactly as the movie depicts it but hey, that's what movies do...There is also some confusion as to people thinking that the German who is allowed to leave by Tom Hanks (called Steamboat Willie in the credits) is the same guy who plunges the knife into the GI's chest...it's not. Spielberg regretted not making them look different after he heard that there was the confusion.The whole point of the movie, to me, is that WE are Private Ryan...that is, we are the ones that so many gave their lives for....we, the generations of Americans then and now who are free today because of their sacrifices. So, like James Ryan, we must ask ourselves each day, what did you do with this freedom...did we do something to "earn" it...lead a productive life when so many in the world can't. What will we do with what has been given us? WE are Private Ryan. Each of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound, moving, and a reminder to thank the Veterans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time. Initially, seeing the headlines and the trailers, I expected a typical wartime drama. Plenty of blood, guts, heroics, and swearing. Well, naturally, that was included. Spielberg brought the reality of war to the screen. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, it may be a movie, but this is something that real boys went through. Something our troops today are going through right now in different nations across the world.I felt that the film asked us all a question: Is our life and the way we live our life, worth the sacrifices that past generations of Veterans fought for and gave their lives for? Are we worth their sacrifice? It is a reminder that our freedom, the freedoms we take for granted, even forget, came with a very heavy price. A price we will continue to pay until the entire world can agree to respect the freedom of each and every soul on this earth.The film was wonderful, and it left an impact on me, as was its intention. It had a powerful storyline and was amazingly well directed. Even the look and style of the cinematography was superb. I rented it, but I will be looking into buying it. It's a story that we should all be reminded of every once awhile. Even if you do not prefer war dramas, at least remember the story and remember the brave men and women who strive every day to keep us free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely the best movie ever made. It was simply a brilliant peace of work, Steven Spielberg has actually made a better movie than Schindler's List. Everything about the movie was superior to all other movies, the acting, the camera shots, the war scenes, the music, and just the overall story. I loved this movie, it shows the ultimate American spirit, and if it shoves patriotism down people's throats, well so be it. If you live in the United States you should feel patriotic and blessed to live in America. The graphic nature of the movie is so necessary for one to get the feel of war. The movie wouldn't have been as good if it didn't have all the blood and carnage, no one knows what war is like unless they've been in war, or if they've seen Saving Private Ryan. Easy 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I did not witness, nor was I even alive during World War II, I- as an American- count this as pretty much the best movie I've ever seen. I look at it like this... if even one TENTH of the movie is accurate as to what our soldiers endured, count me among those who are forever indebted. I cannot even pretend to know what they experienced and what they undoubtedly relive every day, but I am so thankful. I am free to enjoy my life, regardless of my religion, my race, or of my sex because of these heroes. I personally did nothing to earn this honor except to be born an American. Saving Private Ryan reminds us of the sacrifice so many men and women have made in so many wars and battles- we should each live our lives "well" and be "good people" if for no other reason than to honor those who paved the way that we may do just that without repercussions or fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on the big screen on opening day. While the show before mine was clearing out, I saw a guy I knew coming out, his face a mask of dried tears. He's not the kind of guy who cries for anything, so I figured that I was in for something I might not be able to handle. I went in and sat down, shivering with anticipation. The movie starts with an old man in a military cemetery breaking down at the sight of the hundreds of crosses marking the graves of his fallen comrades. I was already near tears by this point. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the infamous twenty-five minutes of the Omaha Beach landing hit me with the force of a speeding plane crash. To put it mildly, I have seen enough violent movies in my time to say I've been pretty much desensitized to violence, even though the occasional violent, gory scene can still get me on occasion. While watching the beginning of this film, I remember thinking at one point, 'This has to stop. Please God, make it stop.'. The rest of the movie doesn't stray too far from the in-your-face style of the first minutes and when all is said and done, you walk away realizing that Spielberg, no matter what his detractors may say, is indeed a genius. I consider this movie to be the reason I wanted to get back into filmmaking after dropping out of film school. This movie makes its points and makes you question the validity of the senseless slaughter of so many innocent lives in the face of war, no matter what side of the fence you speak of. I never gave the WW2 vets a second thought until I saw this movie. Now I think of them and their hardships, especially around Memorial Day. The cinematography here ranks among the best I have ever seen. John Williams score is phenomenal and if you don't believe me, listen to the very last piece of music played over the end credits. It is an incredible piece that can only be described as beautifully patriotic. All of the performances in this film were spot on, though it did jar me a little to see Ted Danson pop up out of nowhere with a smoking machine gun in hand. I cannot recommend this movie enough, though I'd suggest that anyone unnerved by extremely realistic, and at times sadistic, violence should avoid this because it's pretty upsetting. I can only say that like my friend, I walked out of the theater a sobbing wreck. On my way out, I noticed that there were many vets in the audience. Many of them were crying on the shoulders of their wives, who were busy consoling them. Along with the film as a whole, it was a sight I am sure I will never forget. Rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

Not just because it doesn't want to, it doesn't need to. This film already has pure emotion and drama with it's basic theme, anything added to it would only dilute it.It has so many standout moments, too many to mention here, that had me in tears and images of which stayed with me for days.I'd like to see anyone top this excellent war film, it'll be hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIELBERG'S BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw SCHINDLER'S LIST, I didn't think Stephen Speilberg could top himself. This man is such an incredible director who has given us such classics as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T. and now SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.I still can't understand how this film did not win Best Picture in 1999. (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE won) This movie is very violent, but it is violence that is needed to tell the story and make the story realistic. From the opening battle of Normandy, you feel like you are right there on the beach in the battle.The performances in this movie are outstanding. This is Tom Hanks in his best role since FORREST GUMP as the leader of the platoon assigned to find Private Ryan. One of the performances that was underrated was that of Jeremy Davies who played Corporal Upham who makes a fatal mistake with a German officer that comes back to haunt him. Edward Burns was teriffic as well as Private Reiben, who wonders out loud why risk the lives of several men to save one. Tom Siezmore is equally as brilliant as Tom Hanks' #1 man. Even Matt Damon, who I normally do not like, was outstanding.This is such a terrific film because the characters are developed so well and you feel like you know them by the time the movie is over. The battle scenes are outstanding as well. This is the best war movie I have ever seen.I give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN four stars. (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eight for One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Eight for OneThe five-academy award 1998 Steven Spielberg film Saving Private Ryan stars Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), and Sergeant Michael Horvath (Tom Sizemore). The movie begins with World War II D-day invasion of Omaha Beach. As the troops approach the beach in infantry pod boats, they are swept with heavy fire as they struggle to the cover of the hills. Germans sweep the beach with their machine guns, stopping hundreds of American soldiers in their tracks. As Captain Miller leads his troops up the hill to clear a path for the second wave, his troops overcome many obstacles. After taking out the snipers and clearing the bunkers, the infantry rests. In the U.S., letters are being sent out by the hundreds to the families of the soldiers lost in previous battles. It come to the attention of a typist that one mother was about to receive notice of three out of four of her sons were killed in battle. She takes the letters to her superior, and this information immediately makes its way to Washington, D.C. A decision is made to find her last son (Private James Ryan) to relieve him of his duties and to bring him home. Captain John Miller's assignment changes from taking over Omaha Beach to finding Private Ryan and getting him home safely. Angry and confused, eight men set out on this task. The question going through the soldiers' heads is `why are we risking eight for one?' The answer to this question is not simple; orders are orders; and do not question authority.Along the way, they meet many confrontations of troops, snipers, and bunkers. They stumble across a secret radar bunker. Captain John Miller makes a decision to take the bunker rather than sneak past and go on with the mission. By making this decision, he upsets the crew. `The crew states that this is not our objective!' Captain Miller replied, `Our objective is to win this war!' In doing so, this results in the loss of their team Medic by machine gun fire. After taking over the secret radar bunker, Captain Miller leads his troops to another battle site where they join ground troops to find the whereabouts of Private James Ryan. They find Private James Ryan at the bridge along with his troops. Ryan is told the news of his three brothers. Captain Miller orders Ryan to come back with him and his troops. Heartbroken and distraught, Ryan refuses to leave his fellow troops. Captain Miller makes the decision to defend the bridge, then to get Ryan home. Miller's troops prepare themselves for a battle in which they knew could jeopardize the original mission at hand. Fighting begins again with the arrival of German Troops at the bridge. Miller loses his men one by one as the Germans attack. A bullet strikes Miller in the chest, and he falls to ground. Staring at the sky, Miller sees the U.S. air troops bomb the Germans to win the battle. Turning his head to see Ryan standing before him, he utters his final word: `Earn this!'The film in my opinion was fantastic. The scene when the boats landed at Omaha beach was extremely gory. The graphics of color, sound effects and the showing of everybody being shot to death was a real as it comes for me. Great movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't watch this movie without feeling traumatized. To think people had to make life and death decisions in similar circumstances is impossible to imagine. If the one of the reasons for watching a movie is to glimpse life experiences unlike your own, this movie is in an elite group.

		<shortDescription>Saving Ryan's Privates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since today is Veteran's Day I decided to review Saving Private Ryan.Directed by Steven Spielberg this masterpiece War film contains perhaps the most realistic battle scenes captured on film. You see anyone can do an accurate war film but not many have the courage or patience to create an accurate war scene battle. Now while most war films, especially WWII movies tend to focus on the political side of the war this one focuses on the people who fought the war. Which is why this movie is so great. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with doing a war movie centering on the political side but when you focus on the people it gives the movie more of an impact. Which is perhaps why Vietnam movies make some much have an impact on the audience. My theory is that WWII was such an accomplishment to the United States that Producers tend to focus on the political accomplishment.4(****)out of 4(****)starsHAPPY VETERANS DAY!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserved every award it got and probably more. The Acting is excellent, Tom Hanks along with the rest of the cast, Vin Deisel, Edwards Burns, Matt Damon, ect, do an excellent believable job. The Direction is beautiful, great camera shots and everything. But anyone who says this is just another war movie is wrong, this one has a plot, and there are other great war films with plots but, hardly. Yes it still has the big wars scenes of course, but it has something more than just a whole load of killing and explosions, Steven Spielberg always finds a way to do that but still leaving enough energy to keep us interested. Overall this film is accurate, entertaining and powerful enough to make the people in the theater i was in start crying because of their memories, oh the memories. My Vote is 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not just about the war. It is more about the human values and how different people have different ways of valuing life. All this is set at the backdrop of the world war. Tom Hanks as the captain does not hesitate to kill enemy soldiers for his country. On the other hand, he leads his team to find one man because he believes that this job earns him the right to go home. The war is shown exactly as it is in the battlefield. Some of the scenes are gross but real. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon (as Ryan) deliver extraordinary peformances. The sniper in the team who prays to God before shooting his victim, the corporal who fires only one bullet in the whole movie have their own ways of looking at the war and also on their individual roles in the war. Overall, the movie is excellent. The absolute reality of the war as shown in the movie makes us think if anything good really came out of the whole war!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carnage, Destruction and unlimited special effects budgets are what I've come to expect from the so-called "War" films I'd seen. Having not been introduced to the immortalised "Platoon" or even the original run of "All Quiet on the Western Front"; my knowledge of the genre was, to say the least, somewhat limited in 1999. So, with my cinematic background of Rambo-esque classics, I sat down "en-famille" to watched the much-hyped "Saving Private Ryan" when it was released on video. After the opening sequence, you realise that for a film like this, no hype was necassary.Perhaps it's bad etiquette to write a review along this lines, but in simplistic terms, you cannot praise "Saving Private Ryan" highly enough. An enormous staff of set-designers, costume-designers and other assorted specialists mean that you are, truely, sucked into the world of 1944. No detail goes unchecked.Having watched the recent pop-up carnage of Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down", it's clear to me that from a directorial viewpoint, "Saving Private Ryan" is something other filmmakers should truely aspire to. Granted, Speilberg's use of "Shakycams" is borrowed from the great Doctor Strangelove, but the addition of colour footage gives it a completely different perspective on the "world" that is created. You will feel every bone-chilling explosion, every face-numbing gunshot, and watching it on VHS only made me regret my decision to not see it in the Surrond Sound glory of the cinema that much more.Perhaps it's ironic that "Saving Private Ryan" can present such a literally "Incredible" storyline, yet produce perhaps the finest representation of war in history. Individual performances, and most espicially that of Hanks, give us a window on the utter chaos raging around what were ordinary men; and perhaps stands as a tribute to those who fell in the pursuit of freedom. The members of the small unit also contribute a great deal of depth to the film, the bonds between these men being portrayed to the fictional degree that the History Channel consistantly overlooks. Perhaps the group are stereotyped a little, but the mix of personas again adds to the atmosphere; much to the same effect as it does in "The Shawshank Redemption".I'm not often reduced to tears by films; tending to supress my emotions in a true testosterone-fuelled, 16 year old: "Hardman" epsiode. Philidephia? Dry face. Casablanca? Not a drop. And yet, despite being with my family, I openly cried as the screen faded to black in "Saving Private Ryan". It represented an epiphany in the way I watch films: Never before had I been so moved; and, in my view, it deserves the praise it gets as quite simply, "The Greatest War-Film Ever". That is, unless you choose to discount the Rambo trilogy :p</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most accurate representation of warfare, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right, let's get this out of the way with first. Yes, this film is often sickeningly patriotic and it does not give a fair representation of how the soldiers of other nation's (including Germany) suffered dreadfully in the events of June 1944. Good, now that's settled.I first saw this film when I was about thirteen, I'd like to make two points before I go on.1)Before I saw this film I thought war was 'cool'. 2)Before I saw this film I knew little or nothing about the most momentous event of the 20th century.I wasn't expecting much, then the ramps went down on the landing craft and the first twenty soldiers were cut to pieces in a hail of bullets, obliterated in an instant. I was appalled, horrified, all the more so because I knew that this had actually happened, I had seen countless movie deaths, in countless ways before, but nothing like this. The sheer ferocity of the opening beach landing is horrendous. You are one of those soldiers on the beach, desperately tying to find cover from the death raining down upon you from above. The maimed, screaming as medics attempt to operate on them in the middle of the most hellish chaos imaginable. Human instinct would be telling those men just to hide, but they had to do more than just stay alive, they had to take that beach at all costs.This is not just a superb war film, it most definitely is a good drama. The sheer trauma that the common soldier experienced, the fact that young men who had never known death, had to watch their friends slaughtered before their eyes, is skillfully translated. The audience cares about each one of the characters, the death of Wade, the medic, as his friends tried to help him, reduced me to tears - it was so awful. As the search for Ryan progresses the characters begin to develop also. They are ordinary men caught up in the most terrifying events imaginable. Hanks gives an excellent performance, one of the best of his career.The film is possibly the closest thing to war I have ever seen on screen. It pioneered the use of 'shakey-cam' and the use of washed out colours give the film a terrifyingly gritty and dirty realism that dispels any notion of glorious combat. The very sound, the ominous screeching made by the 60ton Tiger tank approaching the town, a hail of machine gun fire slamming into a human body, makes is horrific. Some have complained about the 'faceless enemy' of the German soldiers. If anything this added to the terror, at the film's finale, I remember upon first seeing it, even though I knew it was just German soldiers approaching, it was frightening - those were ordinary men just a few hundred yards down the street, not monsters, but they would kill you if they found you - I can't begin to explain it properly but this particularly a profound effect upon me.The film is emotionally and physically draining, at some points you just want it to stop, but you can't take you're eyes off it. It prompted me to find out as much as I could about the Second World War and for this reason I am now studying History A level on Nazi Germany. It is not perfect - no, but because of seeing it I am now eternally grateful and fully aware of the tremendous sacrifice that that generation made for those after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best war movie I have seen. The filming in general was great, the accuracy was, to me incredible. I've never been in a war and this looks like a very good representation of what it was like in World War 2. From the choatic opening sequence of D-Day, to the final skirmish with the German Soldiers have me hooked and interested in the horrors of war. I liked the whole movie but I have to comment again on the beginning and end war sequences. (Not implying the movie in-between is bad at all, it never bores you and it's still good) The beginning sequence was a great performance of acting of the main cast and a lot of extras, working all at the same time. At the end, you got to follow individual soldiers on their fight with the camera following them. The color tainting, and the authentic weaponry and sound effects makes "Saving Private Ryan" the best war movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg. That name should almost be sufficient. This film is a masterpiece when it comes to showing the brutal sides and consequences of war. How much should an individual pay for the freedom of his or her country? That is an essential question here. The film starts in the present day and ends there as well. The majority of the action takes us back to the days of WW2, where the mouth of a gun made most of the political statements. If you're into war, it doesn't come much better. The casting is excellent. The sound is very realistic and I recommend seing the movie in THX or surround. The length of the movie helps to create the right atmosphere. It doesn't stop, when you think you were just getting started. You should experience this movie rather than listen to what I have to say about it! If you can take the heat of the shells and bullets falling all around you...There is nothing like a movie, that dares to make a statement and puzzles you with the consequences of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** Spoiler country ahead **This film has proved to be one of the more devisive that Spielberg has made and along with Schindler's List, it's certainly the most harrowing. When I first saw this in the cinema, 95% of the audience couldn't stand up as the credits rolled. The trauma induced watching the battle scenes seemed to disconnect everyone's brain from their leg muscles. If you ever want to make anyone realise that war is not a good idea, make them watch this.Many have said that this film doesn't have a plot. Rubbish, the plot is that 8 soldiers go off to rescue the last remaining brother of a family so that some high ranking officer doesn't have tell his mother the worst possible news without something positive to add at the end. Sorry, bit of cynicism there. It don't care if the plot is true, made up, plausible or a steaming pile of cow dung, it's still a plot. To me the number of soldiers who died in WWI to gain 100 yards of ground seems totally implausible - but it happened. In was lots of crazy things happen and sometimes the focus needs to be on the detail rather than the big picture.I agree, the plot is something to hang this film on. It's a bit flimsy but it isn't why the film was made. I think this film, like the gravestones in Normandy, is a monument to the fallen. It's an attempt to do an honest war film. No punch pulling. No batteplans, just individual soldier's stories in one huge story there players within. To do that well you need a simple story and that's what you've got. Now the big controversial bit. Patriotism. Yes, it's an American film made by Hollywood with American actors and money. It's about Americans at war. Maybe everyone should treat it as such. Das Boot is an excellent German war film about Germans and the number of British war films made in the later half of the 1940's about Brits does not need mentioning.But...The rest of world is starting to view America as a bit schizophrenic. On one hand very insular and not really wanting to interact with the world; certainly wanting to be safe from the rest of the world's problems. On the other hand American culture, values, interpretations of history, art, music are everywhere around the world. Indeed most of the world are a little bit American. That's fine as far at is goes. You don't like, you don't eat at McDonald's. However when a brilliantly artistic and truthful film that we all want to share in fails to do this and goes all insular and US-patriotic on us, we get a little bit disappointed. Yes this film tells the truth, but it doesn't tell the whole truth. It's subtle, but it's rewriting history. That gets people's backs up and leads to tension and arguments.The association of the universal truths with the US flag and US soldiers seems to be stealing something that we all own for an individual nation. War it a horrible thing, that men can commit the ultimate sacrafice for another man, that fighting brutalises, that the freedom to make this film was won on those beaches and fields; this film has a message for all of us, not just the US.Films should have an affect on you, they should haunt your thoughts for days afterwards. Saving Private Ryan still haunts my thoughts over 3 years since I saw it. Please see it regardless of where you come from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not an American perspective?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems moviegoers either love or hate this film. Most Brits look down on it for neglecting the Allies perspective. Yes, it is a decidedly American film and why not? Yanks coming ashore at Omaha were not hand in hand with Brits nor did they care. They were with their buddies and they were there to stay alive and kill Germans...not just Nazis...Germans...the enemy. The five Sullivans were real and their tragic deaths ripped the heart out of most normal Americans at the time, and to this day. Americans would never again risk that heartache upon a single mother. Perhaps this did not occur with any British family, making it difficult for the audience to relate to this premise of the film.Many say the first 25 minutes are excellent and then the film fades to standard. I believe the original hoopla is generated by the very real special effects. Few can deny that this film raised the bar for moviegoer battle sensation. The scene in the village, at the end, where Hanks, et al are awaiting the Panzers and the rubble shakes beneath them still sends chills up my spine. Hollywood movie? Sure! American as apple pie! And Hollywood will continue to make "Yank" films because...we will still find those eight Yanks today that will risk their lives to save one.</fullReview>

At the same time it brought the horrors of war and the wonder of film making together at the same time. This is matched with an end battle sequence again that gets the pulses racing and the emotions rising. People have actually complained about the middle segment of the film, claiming it to be clunky, boring and cliche but this is just the unwinding of the plot. The scene where they storm the radar base and capture the German pow is one of the most powerful in the film.

		<shortDescription>Greatest War Movie - Despite What the Germans Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant film. I have never seen a film that gives a better sense of what it is like to actually be involved in combat, in all its shocking and horrifying reality. It also is rare that a World War II film comes along that actually shows American soldiers as real people, who sometimes do things they'd rather not talk about under the intense stress of combat. Take, for example, the American soldiers who shoot the two Germans who are trying to surrender during the D-Day landing. Or Corporal Upham, who is too scared during the final battle to save one of his comrades from being killed. Scenes such as these help lend a humanity to the movie so that, while still rooting for the main group of characters, you realize that sometime, during war, men act in a way that they never would during peace.Now, as for the issue of the portrayal of the Germans during the movie, first of all, I don't see how some people are complaining that they were portrayed as "stupid". I can't think of a single scene in which the German soldiers are shown to be acting stupidly. Are they shown losing the battle? Yes, they are. But guess what? That's what actually happened! News flash: The Germans lost the war! A film that shows brave German soldiers successfully stopping the Americans and British on the beaches and driving them back into the sea would be nothing but a giant work of fiction, because it never happened. And as for all out German "friends" complaining that Germans are always portrayed as the bad guys and evil in World War II films, I have news for you: Germany was the bad guy. Germany acted in as evil a way as a country can act. Germany tried to conquer an entire continent because it felt it was it's destiny. Germany mercilessly butchered millions of Jews and other "undesirables" because they weren't "pure". If Germans don't like being portrayed as evil during World War II, then maybe they shouldn't have acted evil during World War II.</fullReview>

This scene sets the tempo for the whole movie.Legs are blown off,a man is blown in half and a man tries to push his guts back into his body as he screams in pain.In its own way this scene deserves to be compared to the Odessa steps in Battleship Potemkin, the final shoot-out in The Wild Bunch,or the shower scene in Psycho.This introduces us to the characters.Theirs Reiben the smartass New Yorker,Wade's the medic whose mother is a doctor,Jackson is a devoutly religious sniper who prays before he shoots,Mellish is a Jewish kid who knows his enemy,Upham is the bookish rookie translator,Horvath the non-com whos totally devoted to his captain,and Capt Miller...well nobody knows his story.The young squad of men are assigned to find and rescue Pvt. James Ryan whose 3 brothers have been killed in combat and the generals dont want this to turn into another Sullivan like tragedy.The men question the logic risking the lives of 7 men to save 1.Through battle scenes in a destroyed village and one in an open field.The squad is saved by a group of paratropers defending a bridge from the enemy.It turns out that one of them just happenes to be Pvt Ryan. But he wont leave his comrades.So the squad stays and the Germans attack.Men are blown to bits,a head is blown off and the fighting gets up close and personal.the Americans retreat and thats when reinforcements come.This is the most realistic,bloody and best war movie ever.The hand held cameras make the chaos of battle even more in your face,And the men are acted out well,all except Miller(Tom Hanks)who acts out his character so well that you get to understand him and the reasons why he does the things he does.His queit character only wants to go home,and in the end thats what this whole movie is about, men who just want to go home.Overal:10/10 Sound:10/10 Special Effects:10/10 Realism:10/10 Acting:9/10 Story:7/10This is an excellent way to spend 2 hours and 50 minutes.It may be that long but it doesnt feel that long,cause its so good.Just watch it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind that this movie should have won best picture. And it is probably one of the top 25 greatest movies ever made. I loved it. Every actor from Giovanni Ribsi to Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance. But, I could go on forever and ever telling you how much I loved it.It starts out with one of the most powerful opening sequences in film history... the D-Day invasion. Then after, Tom Hanks must lead a small group of soldiers to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon) behind enemy lines.Please watch this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the closest thing to combat from your armchair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of war films and I seriously doubt that any will ever show combat better than this Speilberg offering. I dont subscribe to the view that it ignores us brits, as clearly we were not involved in that area. The aside about Montgomery is not particularly fair, even though I do not rate him as a general, he was playing the part dictated by overall strategy. The first time I saw SPR I rather think I held my breath for the entire landing sequence. Certainly, I remember heaving a huge sigh of relief when it was over. If there is a more intense 20 odd minutes of film anywhere in existence I have never seen it. The film loses many points for some really stupid continuity errors but makes it up hands down for the action sequences. The technique used to film on the beach has had its critics in my circle of friends but I really do think it lent great realism to the action. Many parts of the film were a little twee, some tactics used considerably less than competent. I have never been one to let such things stand in the way of good entertainment. Overall, SPR sits on my pedestal of 'best war film' on the basis of its action sequences. Better war films are out there if you want a really good story, historical representation or total accuracy. If you want to see what it was like to be a soldier in WW2 when the lead flew, then see it on the big screen and be prepared to duck. What a shame that Steven Speilberg did not make 'Enemy at the gates'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry. A tribute to the mothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't watch the movie because you're afraid of watching horrifying scenes, you could try to reconsider your position. All of the blood scenes in this movie have poetry behind them, and they should be understood within their inherent duality: External horror, yet warm at heart. The figure of the mothers is referenced several times in the movie. I think this movie is (at least partially) meant as a tribute to the mothers of the soldiers.This is not a typical war movie. It's not Platoon either. It's very different from what a war movies fan would expect. I guess many war movies fans will dislike this one, while people who usually don't like war movies will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to review something that leaves the viewer speechless?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never knew. I knew that my grandfathers' generation did remarkable things during the war, but I never knew. I knew that we fought a tough battle during D-Day, but I never knew. I knew that people risked, and lost, their lives to fight for our freedom, but I never knew.The reason why this movie is important, especially to my gen-x generation, is that none of us really knew what others sacrificed for our freedom.I walked out of this movie and saw an elder gentleman as I was walking out. I thanked him. After viewing the movie, I went to my car and just rode around for a while, collecting my thoughts. If this movie does not give you a punch-in-the-gut feeling after walking out, then you have missed the point. The point is plain and simple, ordinary people did extraordinary things so that we have the right to be free. Some of my generation take these rights for granted. I did. I no longer do.The rest of this, for the most part, goes into why I disagree with others who did not like this movie. By doing this, I hope that I have also explained why I DO like this movie. I have heard many of the complaints about this movie. I disagree with just about every one of them. I add a disclaimer about this at the end.I have heard that this movie is not "anti-war" enough, that "The Thin Red Line" is a much better anti-war movie. This misses the point of the movie. The movie is not essentially anti-war. It is about the sacrifices that others made to give us our freedoms.I have heard that this movie is too gruesome. I can understand why people say this. But, in order to portray truthfully, the bravery that others made on our behalf, the movie needs to be gorry. I believe that this movie was not so much written for the WWII generation, but for their children, grandchildren, and on down the line. We NEED to understand what others have done.Some have claimed that the movie, beyond the first 20 minutes, does not have enough action. The movie is not an action epic, beyond the first twenty minutes and is not meant to be. The movie is meant to display that these people were ordinary. This is called character development. The characters are not as developed as some would wish, but I believe Spielberg did this with a purpose. The characters are developed to the point that we know that they are ordinary. We are supposed to see that they are just like us (the generations after WWII), yet they did extraordinary things.Some have claimed that the characters are too stereotypic. Well, we are a stereotypic society. We have cultures from all over the world, and they all fought in WWII. While many units may have been homogeneous, many were not. There are no African-Americans in the story, and Spielberg did hold true to the realism there as, sadly, African Americans were segregated from fighting with white soldiers.Some have said that this another example of Americans being jingoistic. Well, we did fight separately from other countries' units. Spielberg did not say that other countries did not fight in the war, but this movie would have been twenty hours long if we chronicled each countries' contributions. Beside that, Spielberg is American, and made a film about the contributions that Americans made. Why others feel that he should make a movie about each countries' contributions is beyond me. If he does, that is his prerogative. If a French director makes a movie about the French resistance, I say, "Good job," not "What about America?"Finally, after fighting off attack after attack, I wish to say, that is fine. That is your right, thanks to the bravery of others. I only wish to say that I hope that those who dislike this movie are still able to see the efforts that others made to give us this right.PS: Thank you Poppop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is hard to describe in words, much like Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. To date, it is the best war film that I have ever seen. With a gutwrenching performance by Tom Hanks, the film is extremely well acted. It is a shame that this film didn't win Best Picture over Shakespeare in Love. Saving Private Ryan was superior compared to its competitors that year. The opening action sequence, the invasion of Normandy, was so bewildering, I really didn't know what to think. I was speechless, especially at the end of the film. This film may make you cry, but it definitely will make you feel powerful human emotion on many levels.

		<shortDescription>Best Pure Filmmaking I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is simply the best pure filmmaking I've ever encountered in a lifetime in the Biz. The Normandy sequences use every technique possible to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, and maybe hiding their heads. Spielberg uses solarization and strobing combined with hand-held shots to put the viewer in the living hell of the invasion. The story, the characters, rung true. This is the way people were before PC and during WWII. Ethnicities that seem exaggerated, were very much in evidence at that time and Spielberg wasn't about to make a post-modern war picture. This is Sands of Iwo Jima / Guadalcanal Diary but realistically portrayed. It made one think if they would be so brave as to ride those tiny LST's to the beach, knowing what was waiting for them.For those who wonder why it didn't win Best Picture, I say, wake up! Do you think the Academy is a pure democracy? Is it not possible that other less talented members are simply jealous of the consistently fine work that has put Steven Spielberg atop his profession? Academy Awards are simply the product of the likes and dislikes of each member of the Motion Picture Academy - nothing more. They weren't handed down from Mt. Sinai and anybody who believes the world is a fair place should open their eyes. 10/10 ***** An experience.</fullReview>

"Black Hawk Down" is a load of bull compared to "Saving Private Ryan", perhaps the most prominent difference being that the former is like 3 hours of propaganda and bad acting and the latter is without doubt the truest and most beautiful portrayal of WWII yet.The cast were excellent: standout performances from Ed Burns (Reiben), Giovanni Ribisi (Wade), Barry Pepper (Jackson) and of course Tom Hanks (Miller).

		<shortDescription>Stunning; should have won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said about the opening scenes of "Saving Private Ryan". Here's all you need to know about it; at preview screenings of it, some veterans who survived D-Day had flashbacks of their unimaginable experiences. Some couldn't bring themselves to watch. That being said, anyone who wasn't there on D-Day should see this film so they will have some small idea of what those brave soldiers went through. After the opening scenes, we get to the plot of the movie, the search for a young man whose brothers have all been killed in the war. A troop of soldiers is sent to bring this young man home. On the way, they question the validity of their mission; why risk a whole group of men to save one? It is a question that has no easy answer, for the characters or the audience.This is, in my opinion, the greatest movie about the Second World War ever filmed. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but lost to "Shakespeare in Love". Why the Academy snubbed "Saving Private Ryan" is a mystery and, again in my opinion, the biggest mistake the Academy ever made.</fullReview>

We Americans like seeing Americans in our movies but we also enjoy a good foreign film. I think DAS BOOT, BLUE MAX and CROSS OF IRON are among the best war films of the 20th century and...SURPRISE.... no Americans. So, lay off, non-Americans.

		<fullReview>I watched "Saving Private Ryan" the other for the third time hoping I could find it better then I did the first two times. I got nothing. The only things about this film that are worth mentioning are the battle scenes and the acting. Everything else about the film is badly done, I didn't care about any of the characters, I felt nothing when they died because I wasn't able to get to know each character and understand their feeling of the war. They (the soldiers) were just there and did nothing but talk and talk and talk. The film is dull and badly written. An excellent war movie is one with great acting, a great plot, great battle scenes, great direction, great dialog, and likeable characters. This movie only has good acting (not great), good direction (not great), and great battle scenes. It lacks everything else needed to make it a great war movie. This war film is not the best ever made, it doesn't even compare to better movies like The Thin Red Line, Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, and All Quiet On The Western Front. If you want to rent or buy an excellent war film that won't bore you half to death then get any one of those films that I just listed. With them you can't go wrong, with Saving Private Ryan you go wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes i enjoyed Saving Private Ryan. Although it was full of Spielberg-esque drama, and not exactly a history lesson here. SPR is very short on the facts that took place during this period in WW2. This movie is basically a story with a plot, that took place during the turning point of WW2. Unlike most war movies, SPR is a movie with fictional characters and the realism of the battle scenes is the only realistic part of SPR. The opening scene was amazing. Better than "The Longest Day", which depicts ultra realistic scenes of the infamous D-day invasion of Normandy France. But if your looking for a really great WW2 movie, then purchase A Bridge Too Far. That is by far my favorite WW2 movie of all time. I thought Stephen Spielberg copied the Kubrick method of hand-held camera style filming he used in Full Metal Jacket. It had a documentary feel to it, and Spielberg definatly copied that. But the battle scenes in this film are unmatched, with the excepton of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down...however..*** stars out of 4..well worth the 25 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie again last night as a dutch network premiere. I have to say it strengthened my impression after my first viewing some years ago. As war films get, it's one of the best, most realistic and exciting there are. And yet, I don't really understand the big deal that people sometimes make of war films. In my opinion, they shouldn't always by revered as "important" films, or be taken with dead-seriousity. After all, no matter how realistic, they are made for entertainment value and little more. This is a movie that has terrific, bloody action, a realistic setting, superb cinematography and production design, well-developed characters, and some emotional moments. But people, is it really anything more than that? It is certainly not a lesson in history. Did private Ryan or captain Miller ever really exist? No. In Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, an obviously superior film, many of the characters shown really did exist. But SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is really just a work of fiction, crafted to manipulate and excite the viewer. I'm not saying that there are major historical innacuracies in it, since I'm not a historian, I'm just saying that it is in no way an extraordinary or transcendental movie experience. It is also far from Spielberg's most accomplished work. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., and JAWS are all clearly on a much higher level, as they all transcend their genres and become something truly extraordinary. PRIVATE RYAN may be a very good war film, but lacks that extra bit of magic to make it truly extraordinary and a masterpiece in ever regard. Like so many war film, it doesn't truly leave an indelible impact on the viewer. And this is a member of the war film genre in every bone of its body. It doesn't surpass films like PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, as the Ultimate War Movie. If you want to see a true masterpiece, a film that is truly unforgettable and extraordinary, don't look for it among the war movies, trust me. See 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. See THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. See RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Those are genuinely extraordinary pictures that transcend the limitations of their genres and bury themselves into your subconscious, never leaving your memories. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, as well as every other war film ever made, can't possibly have that resonance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, the greatest war movies of all time are those that address the issues of why war is fought to begin with, the psychology of the people who fight it, and human nature in general. Saving Private Ryan simply does not address any of this. Spielberg instead packages World War 2 into a neat commercialized container for mass consumption. The movie, although perhaps more realistic in it's depiction of the violence of war than previous films, has stereotypical and flat characters, little character development, too many stupid one-liners and attempts at humor, and a cliched feel-good ending. 'Saving Private Ryan' is maybe a decent drama, but in no way is it in the upper echelon of war films which ask and attempt to answer the real questions of war. If you want to see a good war movie which does address the real philisophical issues of war and human nature, and doesn't have a Hollywood-ized happy feel-good ending, go rent 'Platoon' or 'The Thin Red Line'.</fullReview>

Montgomery wanted to go careful to lessen casualties, nothing wrong with that - after all the British and their Commonwealth allies had been fighting since 1939.The Americans created their own difficulties at Omaha, by landing away from the original beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>let down by a poor script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle scenes in this film, particularly the vivid recreation of a beach on D-Day, are surely the most realistic, vivid and gory battle scenes ever depicted. Spielberg shoots the action as if a camera crew were there amongst the men. The first 20-odd minutes are extremely powerful and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, the great technical merit of the action scenes are let down by the rest of the film. The script is flat so the characters are stuck with being either the cocky Jew, the medic who loves his mum, er mom, or the wise guy new Yorker. The scenes in between the action sequences tend to drag, because there's lots of talking, but no one has anything interesting to say. The scene in the church and in the French town near the end seem to last for hours. There's none of the depth of character or analysis of human behaviour that was apparent in Schindler's list. What made that film so shocking was its objectiveness and absence of sentimentality. The same cannot be said for Ryan. The film has been criticised for only depicting US soldiers in the war, but this is unfair, since its a film about a squad of US soldiers. Its not about the war Germany, the war is just its setting. But all in all, I would recommend this film just to see its reproduction of the horrors of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand and heavy! But only to see once!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all of those who like to see a very well done war movie, realistic and faithful to reality. The Best: The performances, directing, the script and the realism of the war sequences might be for many hard, but... that's the way it was! The Worst: The movie was very long and it's one of those movies you only have to see once, which isn't necessarily bad.During the hard World War II US soldiers risk their lives, beyond enemy lines, to save private James Ryan, (brother of a bunch of killed brothers on action) that should be saved before his mother loses everyone she has in the world.Once more, and not as a big surprise, Steven Spielberg directs this movie majestically, I'm used to that, his muscle for tense and dramatic and action sequences was once more set in motion, wholeheartedly and greatly directing a remarkable cast lead be Tom Hanks. If to you Tom Hanks seemed to you exactly equal to himself again, that's because he is, but that's just me because I believe that Tom Hanks is nowhere near that great actor that everyone makes of him and that's not the only one. America seems to `canonize' some Hollywood actors like Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks and Will Smith, I like neither of them, specially Will Smith, who bugs me immensely, as of Jim Carrey he doesn't bug me that much, what bugs me the most is that Carrey always makes roles of jerk or idiot. Carry on Ryan, the cast his great once more, Matt Damon again proves to be a great actor again.After all this, Saving Private Ryan, is still a must see, wasn't it one of the greatest movies ever made!My verdict 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"POSSIBLE SPOILER"This is a good movie with good performances and superb production values, but hardly the "best war movie of all time". Some scenes deserve notice, however, as truly devastating movie work. And one connecting scene still confuses me.The opening leaves us with, what we will learn later, Ryan as a grandfather many years later visiting the cemetary in Normandy. He is kneeling by a tombstone in tears with his family around him. At the end of the movie, we return to see Ryan now at what seems to be a different part of the cemetary with his family in the distance. His wife comes over and he says tearfully "Am I a good man?" (Referring to the sacrifice others made to save his life). Well, I thought, he should have figured that out by now. Manipulative and cloying, I thought. Then he stands straight, comes to attention, and I think to myself "Oh, no. Don't salute. It's too obvious. Please don't salute. Don't do it". He salutes.The twenty minutes devoted to the Omaha Beach landing are surely the most gruesome, bloodiest twenty minutes ever put on screen. Spielberg captured the horrible reality of war. Bodies are cut in half, limbs are severed, young dying soldiers cry for "Mama". This is what is was REALLY like - not a thing was sanitized here. You have to be emotionally dead not to be affected by what those brave men did at that beach, and what they suffered. And by extension, all the men and women who have died in all wars.For me, the most devastating scene was the little girl being passed down by her father to the well-meaning soldier, both somehow trying to get her to safety. The soldier is killed, and the little girl scrambles over the rubble to get back to her father. Her father lifts her back up, but she stays an arm's length away, crying uncontrollably, the father trying to draw her to him. She is crying and screaming, and then slaps her father hard in the face. Still crying and yelling at him, she slaps him again. For her, it was the ultimate, unforgiveable sin. For him, he was trying to save her life. But war destroyed this most indestructible bond imaginable between a father and his trusting little girl. This was the greatest horror of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mishmash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on TV last night, so I missed a lot of the sound effects that I'm sure contributed a great deal to the atmosphere. But based on what I did see, I thought the film had some great things in it, but was still flawed.Spielberg seemed mainly interested in re-creating the "feel" of fighting in WWII, and in many ways he did an excellent job (as far as I can tell, not having been there). The camera work and stunt choreography was often simply astonishing, and I'd like to give a special jaw-drop to the stuntmen who worked on the film. But Spielberg's goal of verisimilitude interfered in some ways with the storyline. I agree with a previous commentator who said that the handheld camera was sometimes distracting and difficult to watch. Having a bunch of extras stroll in front of the lens whenever possible did add to the sense of "you are there", but it also made it hard to concentrate on what the main characters were saying. When the screenplay suddenly jumped from cinema verite to heavy symbolism (STOP here if you don't want to learn any details about the plot), with the agonizingly slow death of an American Jewish soldier at the hands of a representative German (while a terror-struck American Goy lies powerless outside), the transition was awkward. (Though such heavyhandedness would have been annoying in almost any film.)I didn't think the characters were particularly well-drawn--in fact, I couldn't tell them apart much of the time (though I suppose uniforms contribute to that). I got the impression Spielberg didn't want to waste too much time exploring character when he could be terrifying the viewer. In fact, I think some of the film was sadistic, though I'm sure Spielberg would argue that he was simply trying to show the actual horrors of war.I could have done without the couple of misogynistic anecdotes from some of the soldiers (although probably many soldiers talk like that). One of the previous commentators thought Private Ryan's story about his brothers and a neighborhood girl showed his "humanity"--I thought it showed that he was an a**hole. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater; I wouldn't want to know how many people laughed at that story. I was grateful for the "you-disgust-me-but-I'm-trying-not-to-be-obvious-about-it-given-the-difficu lt-situation-we-are-in" expression on Tom Hanks' character's face when he heard it. (At least, that's how I read it.)Overall, I think Spielberg took on more than he could chew--he seemed to jump back and forth between epic reenactments and the storyline of his main characters, rather than finding a way to fuse the two into a coherent whole.I appreciate the war movie recommendations that other commentators made, and would like to add my own: "Europa, Europa." But it's really a civilian story, so battlefield fans might not find it so interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but not the best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As well as giving a brief review of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, I would also like to give a little bit of the history behind it. Granted, I have not read all 1300+ of the previous reviews that are already here as I begin to type, but I did read one review that I feel I must correct. Somebody said that the film was loosely based on the Sullivans, who were five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa who all died when their ship, the Juneau, was torpedoed off Guadalcanal in November 1942. This person was misinformed. The Sullivans were indeed real men who died in the PTO of the war, and were even mentioned in "Saving Private Ryan" (their deaths were the reason that the four Ryan boys were supposedly split up into different units), but the story was in no way based on them. It is, however, loosely based on the Niland brothers. The real Private Ryan was Sergeant Fritz Niland of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (P.I.R.). He is mentioned in Stephen Ambrose's novel "Band of Brothers" as a friend of Donald Malarkey's and Warren "Skip" Muck's (played by Scott Grimes and Richard Speight Jr., respectively, in the HBO miniseries.) Shortly after D-Day, Sergeant Niland learned that his brother Bob had been killed. Bob was part of the 82nd Airborne, which was another regiment that jumped behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day. Niland then discovered that another brother, who had been a platoon leader in the 4th Infantry Division, had been killed at Utah Beach. When he returned to his company, a fellow soldier was looking for Niland to tell him that his third and final brother had been killed in the China-Burma-India theater, and that he was supposed to be sent home immediately -- and he was. No secret search mission. No babysitting bridges. No defying orders. However, like Private Ryan, he did return home to a mother who had recently received death notices for three of her sons. There might be some spoilers here, I guess. Nothing that ruins the ending of the film, though. Saving Private Ryan's realism is undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to war films (I think "Band of Brothers" outdid it, though... then again that came three years later.) The opening D-Day sequence is spectacular, and it really gave the sense of what it was like to be there. Random moments stuck in my head much after the movie had progressed into its search for Ryan ("These're all we've got between us and the Almighty!" --referring to the cross-steel objects that had been placed on the beach by the Germans in order to rip apart landing crafts on a high tide but actually worked to the advantage of the invading Americans; Captain Miller's (Hanks) shouting "tell Shore Party this, tell Shore Party that!" only to find out that the radio man had a giant hole puncturing his face and that the radio was busted; one soldier getting shot in the helmet and Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) saying "Lucky b*****d," then the soldier takes off his helmet and is shot in the head; and of course, the terrifying "Mama!" screams.) All of these elements, plus the incredible special effects, sounds, realistic-looking beach and amazing costumes make the scene one of the best combat sequences ever filmed. I really did feel like I was there. The rest of the movie went downhill. The first time I saw it, I thought the whole movie was fantastic, but on later viewings (the seventh, the eighth... the twelfth, the thirteenth... yes, that many) I realized I didn't like it as much as I originally thought I did. Captain Miller and seven men, who are undoubtedly part of the stereotypical combat squad (the hick sharpshooter, the Italian guy, the Jew, the worried guy, the annoying guy everyone hates, the brave Sarge, and the medic who is more concerned about the safety of others than the safety of himself) are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan who has lost three brothers within a week and is to be sent home immediately. Ryan jumped into Normandy with the 506th P.I.R., part of the 101st Airborne (the same Airborne our friends of Easy Company in "Band of Brothers" are in), but he's been misdropped and is lost somewhere behind enemy lines... as were about half of the men dropped into Normandy early on D-Day. Misdrops were everywhere. Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) calls the mission "finding a needle in a haystack" and Miller corrects him, "It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles." The rest of the movie is fantastic in realistically portraying the horrors of war, and the acting is superb by every actor who commits themselves to a role. The actors portray a bunch of World War II Army Rangers as accurately as they can. Much of this is probably thanks to Captain Dale Dye, who put them through a boot camp before the movie began shooting. Dye makes a brief appearance as the War Department Colonel in the beginning of the film (and for "Band of Brothers," which he also helped with to transform actors into soldiers, he had a much larger role as Colonel Robert Sink, and does a great job representing him.) However, as I watched it more and more, the plot grew weak and boring for me. That's something I never thought I'd admit, but I'm admitting it now. I guess I like things of this measure to have actually happened, such as Band of Brothers actually happened... I don't know, it's something about eight guys wondering through all of France to find one guy that begins to disturb me now. I can't put my finger on why. Oh well. It's still a great film, but simply not the best... Check out The Thin Red Line for a more philosophical approach and Band of Brothers for a brilliant approach to real events and real characters.

But , hey, Ted Danson and Steven Spielberg - how dare you disparage the British effort both in the landings and in the D-Day campaign? We don't need ditsy Hollywood glamour guys making pat judgements about the courage and sacrifice of the British Army in WWII - and passing it off as coming from character won't wash You only make yourselves sound foolish. If you want true realism as opposed to brittlle Tinseltown hogwash, check out the brilliant Russian film Come And See instead - Spielberg appropriated much of its horror for his story, and needless to say , his ain't half as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan, quite simply, is extremely overrated. Oh, the movie isn't a total wash, in fact, about 1/2 is fantastic, but there's also 1/2 total crap. The battle scene that begins the film is fantanstic, especially since it goes on and on for a full 20 minutes. Without a doubt the highlight of the movie. In addition, the men's journey to find private Ryan is usually quite engaging, and the performances, particularly those of Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, and Tom Sizemore, are excellent. However, all that good stuff is surrounded by weak sentiment and logic that rings completely false. For starters, the scenes of the old Ryan that bookend the film are Spielberg at his most cloying. There's nothing more annoying than a director pulling every trick possible to get tears out of his audience. Besides that, the film is extremely manipulative and is derailed by some ridiculous logic at the end. Despite all this, Saving Private Ryan is still a sometimes engaging film, and is worth seeing. But #26 all time? Please! The Thin Red Line, which was released with much less hype the same year is much better. In fact, after you see this movie, track down the HBO film When Trumpets Fade, an extremely underrated war film from the same time with much less phony emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 20-30 mins of war are breath taking, one sits there in wonder as to "could I have done this?", or "what the hell was it like to be there?", which is where the film for me personally falls down later on, because no matter how undeniably advantageous the presence of the US to allies during the war was, they were'nt the only allies at Dunkirk!! Now admittedly it could be deemed more offensive to have British, Canadian troops etc as guest stars, or bit roles, but I think what nulls this argument is the stars and stripes we are drowned in at the end of the movie!! Now unfortunately comparisons will always be made to the thin red line, if no other reason than because they were released in the same year. There you have an engagement where Americans were the only allies present!!, yet this fact isn't driven down our throats by a flag pole!! The other main gripe is the villian of the feature, the German soldier who we see begging for his life, and who we are made to realise is a human being after all. Quite a moving piece of cinema, which later on is ruined by the reappearance of the said German, all suited up and ready for killing the main characters. "y'see they should've killed him after all" a phrase undoubtedly uttered by many people watching, but don't those people hate Germans any way?, wasn't it a bolder move to let us feel sorry for him and leave it at that? Overall an over-hyped film all explosions and fairy tale, from let's face it the most over-hyped director in the world. "I liked jaws but....."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American, overlong, sentimentally contrived, brutally realistic, overrated but still worthy of high praise, `Saving Private Ryan' is a testament to what can be done to highlight moments of a country's history.Okay I admit I am British-born and I am going to mention the lack of any other nationality in the film, so I shall start with this obvious moot point.What annoys people is that Tom Hanks' unit never comes across someone of another nation as they move inland and not the superlative and startlingly realized opening. Anyone who knows the slightest bit of history knows that the airborne forces were miss-dropped all over Normandy. Having said that if we British complain so much about the non-representation of our forces in American films why don't we make something equally as jaw-dropping, after all most of the technicians on the film were British? I'll tell you why not. After the release of his film `A Bridge Too Far' in 1977, director Richard Attenborough said he would never make another film whilst participants in the historical event were still alive. Why? Because veterans of the Parachute Regiment complained that they had been made out to be TOO heroic. Hollywood makes `U-571' we make `Enigma', go figure. We should stop taking pot shots at our American cousins, who did bail us out of the war even if it was late in coming, and make some films to redress the balance.What rankles the most is the underhand way in that Spielberg comments on Field Marshall Montgomery. So he was egotistical ? show me a military leader who isn't but to have two field officers passing judgement?? Come on. The soldiers I spoke to were more bothered about keeping themselves alive than worrying about how they rated their commanders. Most of my family were killed in China, many of my South African relatives fought in Africa and Europe. My grandfather and father's friends included bomber pilots, paras and Chindits, so I understand the need to honour these men. I have visited Pointe Du Hoc and I have full admiration for the Rangers that tackled their objectives. But I digress.The opening is phenomenal and is being recreated, derisorily, time and again in computer games. Nothing has captured the sense of what it must have been like but this goes some way to accomplishing that. The first time viewed I don't think I breathed out.Unfortunately after such a visceral experience there is always going to be a comedown, physiologically this is what is going to happen with adrenalin and thus the viewer is unwittingly experiencing what an infantryman might have gone through. The comedown for the audience however, is in the film's pacing.The mid-section does drag and yes maybe this is to show the lulls between the fighting etc. But if I wanted to experience boredom and nothing I would do nothing. Or I would watch `The Thin Red Line' a truly dull experience. Indeed this lack of pacing is noticeable on repeat viewing.The characterization is not fully realized for such a running time and many of the characters remain clichéd eg: dependable Sarge, the coward. Nevertheless this does not detract from the film as the casting compensates in their visual appearance. From just their looks we are compelled and can empathize.The cinematography, editing, and sound are all first rate, as we have come to expect from Spielberg although the shafts of light were unnecessary. The washed out colours added a texture of reality and, with the age of digital film-making, the look of the film is far from the normal sheen of fantasy - an edge of documentary lending itself.On a technical note, and perhaps superficial, there are a few errors that irritate. Firstly why do they use the mortar shells when they have grenades on their belts, which stay unused? Having practised fire support team drills why does Mellish not carry the spare ammo? The unit has two bazookas and yet they leave one lying around. Lastly continuity should have picked up the fact that Tom Hanks' pistol suffers stoppages twice consecutively when he is firing at the Tiger tank, an impossibility. But these are minor complaints.Overall ****/***** far better than `The Thin Red Line' and on a par with `A Bridge Too Far'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is the most over-rated film of the 1990s. If you were to see the film according to the reviews you'd think it was the best film of all time, which is far from the truth. The first 30 minutes, for one thing, have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie! While the opening is admittedly the best part of the film in terms of accuracy and its intensity, it simply shouldn't be there. It appears that the Normandy scene is just there so Stephen Spielberg can tell us what a "great" director he is. While the opening scene may be accurate the ending is right out of the Dirty Dozen in its implauabilty with something like 12 soliders taking out no less then what seems to be 75 nazis! I will say that I enjoyed the film and it is by no means bad, all I am saying is that the film is not as great as people say. I believe that in the summer of 1998 critics simply saw who was directing and starring in the film and thought right away it was going to be a 4 star movie which it wasn't. If your looking for a great war film see Glory, Gettysburg, or Spielbergs own Empire of the Sun. I give the film 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst SPR might not be the be-all and end-all war movie, I take great humor in reading most of the negative reviews on this movie. Many have nothing at all to do with the movie per se, but more with people's gripes about how other nations were portrayed in this movie.GET OVER IT!The movie portrays the efforts of the American Rangers on Omaha Beach. That's O-MA-HA. Not Gold, not Sword, not Juno. That's why there's no portrayal of French, Canadian, or British troops.It seems to me, that any time there is a movie that shows what the US did in WWII, and doesn't give equal time to the other allied troops, everyone needs to kvetch. What most seem to forget is that the US lost more troops than all the other allied forces combined, that they spent more than all the other counties, (which still have not paid the US back) and were it not for the US's involvement in WWII, all of Europe would today be wearing lederhosen and playing the accordian. This from a country that was not directly affected by the events taking place in EuropeSimilarly, I read many reviews taking umbrage with the negative comments directed towards Montgomery.GET OVER IT!Monty was a megalomaniac with a serious case of p*n*s envy because he couldn't run the whole show. Patton proved that he could out-battle, out-tactic, and out-run Monty in any theatre of war. Granted, Monty had some success in Africa, but he spent the rest of the war whining to Eisenhower for equal authority, and supplies, which (I believe) Eisenhower gave him to shut him up, at the expense of Patton's troops, who were taking names and kicking butt. What did Monty do? Why Operation Market Garden, of course. An operation that pretty much decimated all the allied forces that took part in it.Next, I read about so many people finding the middle of the movie boring. Do these commentators forget the adage about war being "long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror?" What did you expect, that they fight a gazillion troops all the way to Ryan, and fight their way back out again unscathed? War IS like that. It is NOT like the current action movies out there today, where the hero might get grazed by a bullet and continue to fight, only to get the girl in the end.I also read about the Germans being demonized in this movie. How quickly they forget Auschwitz; how quickly they forget Dachau. How quickly they forget that as an occupying force, the Germans raped whomever they pleased, shot whomever they pleased. Millions of Germans bought into Hitler's promises. They willingly went to war for him. They tried to conquer the world, and cared not for the innocents they were slaughtering along the way.So don't whine about it. In this politically-correct, liberal, UN "Peace-Keeping" day, we forget that soldiers were encouraged back then to HATE their enemy; to believe him the devil. They called the enemy "Krauts," and "Nips," and "Eye-Ties," so that when the time came to kill them, soldiers were able to do it. Back then we fought until they were defeated. Today, we do it until they say "I'm sorry," and then pay them billions of dollars to rebuild. Finally, remember the scene after the US took the beach: The scene of Americans carelessly shooting surrendering enemy forces. Don't try to say that it was one-sided.Lastly, I saved the D-Day beachhead for last. Too many people have commented that this was too gory, too long, too dully filmed, and not an accurate depiction of how war really is. To that, I can only offer this: Why then, did so many veterans of that invasion feel the need to walk out of the movie, stating that they couldn't watch it because it was too real? Why did many veterans cry during this scene? As to it being too dully filmed, please check your history: The invasion had been postponed several times because the weather was too rainy, and as late as the day before, it was pouring rain up and down the French coast, and in England as well.Saving Private Ryan might not be the best war film ever made, but it is the best war film made TO DATE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what the-!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just saw this movie today and i am totally upset about the beginning. in the first ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan there is more blood, violence,and gore of which are all terribly graphic. i am not against violence in movies because i love films that are hailed as violent films like A Clockwork Orange and Reservoir Dogs. but no one hailed Saving Private Ryan as a violent film its called a masterpiece. and i am bothered by this. they showed more bloody/gory violence in it than i have ever seen before. it makes the most violent movies i've ever seen look like kid movies.don't get me wrong i thought that it was an o.k. movie but the plot was stupid and only there so Spielberg could make a bunch of long, violent, and dramatic WW2 battle scenes. Seriously, the US government would never risk a bunch of lives so that a women could not have every one of her sons die. it's just not likely.now i know that the movie was trying to be realistic but i think they went to far. and the drops of blood on the screen itself is disgusting. Spielberg, as usual, messed up again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trifle disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna make a bucket-load of friends with this review, but I'm sorry, Saving Private Ryan left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. (Note:one or two spoilers ahead!)Firstly, the story is, well, stupid. The American army sends 8 men, under the command of Cpt. Miller (Tom Hanks), to go behind enemy lines is Normandy (just after D-day), to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), as his mother has already received telegrams informing her that her three eldest sons have been killed. A)It's simplistic; B)The army is not that compassionate. I'm sorry, it wouldn't happen, not then, not now.It's a shame, as the film has loads of qualities, like most Spielberg movies. There are the battle scenes, which are immensely realistic. The beginning 'beach scene' is like watching a documentary, it seems so real and true to reality. In fact, most of the battle scenes are great, they're all very exciting. This is due to the great camera work: hand-held, and to the effects: the sets are fabulous, the music is absent during battles, for realism, and the scenes are bloody and realistically disturbing. Saving Private Ryan best invokes the chaos of war. Full Metal Jacket evoked war's stupidity, Paths of Glory was about the wastefulness of combat, and Deer Hunter (my favourite war movie) was about it's heartlessness. Bur 'Ryan' creates scenes of madness and chaos, in keeping with the madness of the mission. With the exception of Hanks and Damon, the acting is terrific. Adam Goldberg, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi and Tom Sizemore are great, as is most of the cast.Yet these qualities are wasted by a lot of drawbacks. I can make my peace with the story, it can be called poetic license, although, the supposingly compassionate American army did send hundreds and thousands of G.I.s to their deaths by making the land on and storm the beaches of Omaha and Utah, which were surrounded by easily-defended but hard-to-attack cliffs, from which the Germans easily massacred the advancing American troops. If they had chosen a duned beach like the English and the Canadians did, the casualties would have half those suffered. But I digress. What I don't like is the reckless clicheing. There's Upham, a detestable character, seen in about every war or adventure film ever. He's wimpy, feeble, and never uses violence. Oh, and his complacent wetness results in the deaths of several of his squad-members. Yet he's a corporal. Let's face it, he wouldn't have gotten past training. Also, the Germans are pictured to be monsters. They are the enemy, only there to be killed or to kill, and they are always more treacherous than the good old trusty G.I.s, who all have hearts of gold, even the aggressive Rieben (Burns), who is another cliche character, by the way. I mean, just look at the German they release, who comes back and cold-bloodedly kills a couple of our goodies, and is made instantly hateable. While watching it, my mum cried 'Kill that b*st*rd German!' I rest my case. Finally, the ending is awfully twee. The death at the end reminds me of every sappy film on earth: the tears, the whispering voice, the brave face, the honorable death. My God, it's like E.T.! I admit it, I laughed! Radio Flyer is less Sappy! As I said, I don't like Hanks or Damon. Damon is sort of smartass, big-headed yob, just like in Good Will Hunting (why did everyone like that movie?). And Hanks is just being Hanks. He's just reprising his Philadelphia persona, but at least it was original back in 1993. You know, he's all goody two-shoes, all honest and pure, and he's a tad over-weight, I hate to say it. He's almost as twee as in Castaway, which is a dreadful movie. I've only enjoyed watching Tom hanks in two movies: Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. At least in those, his performances were original!It's a shame that Spielberg leaves realism behind halfway through 'Ryan', and turns to sentimentality and sappiness, because the beginning announces great stuff. A shame. 5/10Uppers: 1)Great camerawork; 2)Realistic battle scenes; 3)Great sound; 4)Dramatic portrayal of the chaos of war; 5)The supporting castDowners: 1)Hanks and Damon are a four letter word rhyming with trap; 2)Riddled with cliches; 3)Upham's character: what a stereotype; 4)What is this, The Dam Busters? Why don't they just run up screaming "Filthy krauts!" and "Dirty Jerry!"? What a manichean portrayal of the Germans! Quite tasteless; 5)The ending is downright trite!A quick note: It's amazing how, in the U.K. and France at least, Spielberg avoids severe certificates. Jurassic Park easily warranted a 12, it is a PG-13 in the U.S. After all, a man's arm does get ripped off! In Schindler's List, we witness the horrendous mistreatment and murder of Jews, plus several scenes of nudity, yet it remains a 15. And in 'Ryan', people are disembowled and shot to bits in grisly detail, yet it is also only a 15. I agree that we need to be more liberal, but why does Spielberg alone get this special treatment. I see it as a tribute to his talent as a director (apart from Saving Private Ryan and E.T.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to write about historical innaccuracies - this is an American film for Americans ( bit like Forrest Gump in that respect ). I thought the first 30 minutes with the assault on the beach was great and very effective - probably the best piece of action I've seen. However the next piece of the film is very average and verges toward sentimentality - if you want to see what this bit could have been like check out "Cross of Iron" - and it just seems to peter out toward the end. I wasn't that bothered about what happened to any of them or whether they saved Ryan or not. I think it would have been better if "mom's apple pie" had been kept out of the last half and it would have been a more honest film.</fullReview>

It has you clinging to your seats all the way through I would recommend this film to any one that is not younger than 17 because of the intense violence. But over all I would recommend if you have not seen this film to go out and rent it. It is touching film and will have you crying your heart out at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one thing bothers me about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a very good movie. It isn't entirely historically accurate, but it is a movie and doesn't really bother me.I'm Canadian, {For anyone who is wondering what country a Canadian comes from it is Canada, the one above the U.S.A.} and it does bother me that there isn't a Canadian or British soldier in sight. Truth be told only Canada reached its D-Day objective, though it was a single tank unit. Anyone who is fuzzy on history, there was more than one landing at D-Day, there was five in fact. Two by Britain, two by American and one by Canada. So other than omitting the existence of two countries that was fighting WWII long before America got into it, I liked the movie. Also Tom Hanks was in the movie and, I think he will go down in history with names like Gregory Peck or Jimmy Stewart. The Omaha Beach invasion is most definitely the goriest scene in any movie in history. Even last years Gladiator doesn't even come close. A spectacular scene that is breath taking in the fact that it actually happened and real men were doing what Tom Hanks did. This is a very good movie. Simply put it is the best World War movie I have ever seen {Not saying much I'm young}.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that has suffered from backlash (and pretentious reviews here)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning spoiler alert! You can't fault one for claiming that every thing that occurs after the tumultuous D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan is anticlimactic. True one supposes, but not really apposite. The remainder of this Spielberg tour de force would have made an exceptional film, but the opening sequence must truly be judged sui generis. That particular maelstrom on the Omaha beach is as impressive a display of controlling disorder as any in filmmaking. The obstreperous milieu, the frenetic panic (adroitly interspersed with slow motion to show the effect of the fulmination), and the recherché violence (to the point where many vets have claimed that the auteur went beyond the actual level of blood and gore) are all here in sobering collusion and detail. The rest of the film is still well worth viewing, it simply cannot carry the same weight in motion picture achievement that the D-Day beginning does. The plot and dialogue are good and the acting is well done (no standout performances, the historical background is the star). Also several scenes are striking: General Marshall's eloquent reading of President Lincoln's letter, the mother losing her strength on the porch as she meets the announcers of her children's demise, the morphing of the young Ryan into the older man. It is a fantastic picture overall, but just doesn't seem to reach the epic standard of, say Braveheart, that it seems to be reaching for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a toss....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll start with something positive. Those scenes - you know, *those* scenes, which everybody would not stop crapping on about being so bloody brilliant, that is the opening battle scenes of the D-Day invasion - are done, yes, almost brilliantly. Perhaps it was merely the choice not to pull any punches in portraying graphic deaths and mutilations, (or maybe it was just the fact the volume was cranked up to extreme rock gig levels at the cinema I was in), but the battle scenes of this movie were actually done very, very well. I - and I say this as one who has watched one hell of a lot of war movies over the years - was quite impressed.That being said, the rest of the movie was an utter crock of s**t. I've probably seen worse, but when it's accompanied by the kind of hype this one came hand in hand with, it's hard to remember that fact. I think the problem for me was that it purported to be so much *more* - more of what I don't know, 'art' maybe, or serious historical narrative, or cinematic realism, perhaps - but really, it wasn't even just a good old shootem'-bangem' war movie. Personally, I like my war movies best when they're high on the intellectual ponderings of the ambiguous nature of good and evil and all that pretentious style jazz. However, I'm also rather partial now and then to a good old, superficial war action flick with lots of fake violence and intriguing plot twists of the Alister Maclean variety.This film failed on all accounts. It tried to be an intelligent, thoughtful movie about the horrors of war and the nature of heroism, but frankly, it stank. Here's the litmus test for this film - take out the aforementioned well done battle scenes, and what do you have? A tired, old, extremely cliched, badly written, and above all, boring, war movie of the kind we all thought the war movie genre had moved on from decades ago. But hey, I shouldn't just bag it out without some reasons, now, should I?Firstly - if you're going to hype up about historical accuracy in the promotions for your movie, at least make sure the damn thing actually is historically accurate. Yet, as far as actual history goes, this movie is so inaccurate they may as well claimed WWII consisted of martians invading New York and the Americans fighting them off (oh, hang on, that was the season before's blockbuster). Now, I understand that this is a movie, not a documentary, and certain dramatic elements are necessary to sustain interest, (not that they worked). It's fiction. Fine, I'm happy with that - in fact, I'll go as far to say that in normal circumstances I don't give much of a toss whether it has any historical accuracy at all. Only in this case historical accuracy was one of the selling points of the damn film.For all you kiddies who may get your history lessons from the movies, let me just repeat - this movie is very, very badly HISTORICALLY INACCURATE. If you want to know exactly how, as I don't have time to go into every detail here, go look it up. You know, in a *book*.(Scary aside here: I used a military metaphor with a bunch of fifteen year olds recently, who looked at me blankly at mention of the Gulf War and had no knowledge whatsoever of the social, cultural and political circumstance surrounding WWII. Yet their eyes all lit up with recognition when, in desperation, I turned to Saving Private Ryan to illustrate my point. Ugh.)Yes, before you ask, I have studied the period. Extensively. And frankly, if the Germans were as dumb as they were portrayed in this movie, why did it take so long for US to win the war? Oh, and another thing - just where was everyone else? I know criticisms of Hollywood being overly US-centric are so common as to be cliched themselves these days, but really, as far as I can see from this movie, the Americans were the *only* ones in the war. I'm sure they only let the Germans in because to have Americans fighting Americans would have produced just a tad too much ambiguity, and we couldn't have that, now, could we? (I must admit, I'm getting a bit bored with the whole America saves the world again thing... though at least in 'Armageddon' I could laugh at Bruce Willis' sacrifical ending. One of the top ten hysterical film moments of the decade, that one.)The acting was pretty much as you'd expect, Hanks was fine, the rest backed him up without any major problems, I didn't truly notice the performances to tell you the truth, either good or bad. The sets were, of course, wonderful, to back up the elaborate battle scenes. The rest, well, what else can I say?Characters were cliched, badly so. The nature of war was reduced to a very superficial good Americans versus evil Germans, and - *shudder*, dread I say it, - a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Not even cheap, b-grade action flick war films rely on that foolish mantra anymore. We've seen it all before, it's boring, and it's above all, *dumb*.(Talking about dumb, another scary aside: Walking out of the cinema after seeing this film, a twenty something couple were walking arm in arm just ahead of us. She asks him: "What war was that?" He replies: "The Vietnam War, baby." Oh, the humanity.)All in all, maybe I'm a fool for expecting something worthwhile to come out of all the money and effort spent on this film - I should know better, big budget blockbusters rarely, if ever, deliver. This one purported to be more than just a blockbuster, however. It promised thoughtful intelligent treatment of the subject matter. Unfortuantely, it failed. Miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War what is it good for?.... An amazing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I commend Steven Spielberg on this spectacular movie. Saving Private Ryan is, or at least it should be, one of the best war films ever created. From the beginning and until the end of the movie i hardly blinked (or even breathed during some scenes). One of the reasons which made me appreciate this film more is that i saw it with my grandfather... who happens to be a veteran of WW2. Even though he wasn't at Omaha Beach, or even saw as much action as the men in the movie did, i could tell how he felt by looking at how he watched the movie with his eyes and how his posture was. This movie was also one of the only movies i have ever seen him not fall asleep during. That is only one of the many good reasons why this film was enthralling. The characters were also well picked despite the fact that alot of the actors in this movie were actors that don't star in many films. Not only that but Spielberg made these actors live as actual soldiers lived at that time so that they would get the feel of how a soldier really felt. Tom Hanks was also phenomenal for his part (as always)and each other actor acted so well that you feel terrible when one of them gets killed or hurt because you like each one of these soldiers... err uhh actors i mean. The cinematography was top notch and that goes for costumes,sound,graphics,backgrounds, and any other things that would make a movie worth seeing over and over again. Of course this film isn't for everyone... especially those of you who are squeamish or sensitive and this probably isn't for children either. But for those of you who are in the mood to see an amazing, well-done, action packed, heart felt, movie then rent this one anytime. Oh yeah this is also one of those movies that are alot greater on big-screen.. if you know what i mean. Enjoy every scene!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an okay movie. It looked very good and the direction was well done, but it just seemed a bit trite to really push it beyond the average.The story was pretty lame, and all through the movie you get beaten over the head with morals and messages about how war is bad and peace is good. The big battle scene in the beginning starts out well but by the end it becomes a case of "yes, we all know war is bad. Could you get on with the movie now?".The characters seem pretty false and boring. They have the usual hollywood moments (when they want tension they make the characters yell a lot, when they want a big cathardic climax they have string music and a short, "deep" sentence) which make it seem less a serious work and more a money-making device that uses "tricks of the trade" to make audiences think they are watching a good movie.And all the jingoistic flag-waving was a bit monotonous ( i don't think American filmmakers realise how scarily fanatical it makes Americans look). And the total absence of any other allied country in the picture was notable.It looks good but has no real depth or substance, and hence no real credibility when it claims to be the greatest war movie of our time.</fullReview>

And I feel sorry about wasting valuable time of my life watching scenes from a butcher shop - a clear intention to shock us - and b-class drama. It's not a waste. It has some bigtime stars and even some good actors in it - few of them perform extremely good too. It is rich (and that shows) in every aspect of the film, it is technically perfect, it is made from the stuff "intellectual block-busters" are made of. So, why did I hated it? Because, there is something more in a good film than all the above. There is feeling, there is genius, there is passion, there is more than kindergarten morals. And none of them is present in "saving private Ryan". You want to watch a film about how horrible war is? Watch "Jonny got his gun". Watch "Full Metal Jacket". Watch "The Iron Cross". Hey, you can even watch "Platoon" or "The thin red line". Not this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps the most powerful, emotional film I have scene. I openly wept at various times in the film. We are shown the horrors of combat first hand. We get to know the main characters, and grieve at their loss.I've just sat here and read the reviews posted before me and let me say this, many, many of you do not get this picture at all.I have read people comparing this picture to T2 and The Matrix. Hey, I like A good sci-fi action film as well but that is far from the genre that is attempted here.And as far as comparing this to Full Metal Jacket or Platoon (both good films in their own rights) this was a different time, a different war, with different politics. There is no comparing the two wars.If you haven't seen it rent it, or buy it. Go into the past in THEIR shoes. Hit the beach with your fathers, your uncles and grandfathers on D-Day. Feel what it's like to be involved in a mission you don't agree with but have to continue on. Grieve for the death of a friend.This movie is a tribute to all of the veterans of D-Day (god bless them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Morally Powerful War Drama brought to the Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "SPR" back in 1998 on opening night, and was moved then and still am. I display it prominently in my DVD case, and defend it as the best War movie ever made.What I can't figure out is why people "can't get it". When you observe the two bookend scenes of the old man and his family, and the American Flag--it says much. I think it is a question of values and morals. Far to many people watch Oliver Stone's "Platoon" and can only think that war is evil, and anything that goes back to WWII is graphically irrepressible. While "Platoon" is a great adaptation of the Vietnam War and I'll endorse it for that conflict, and why we should never have been there, all one has to do is see Spielberg's earlier epic of "Schindlers List" to realize why WWII was right for America to be in. All too often these politically correct values that came out of the Vietnam War era seam to go against what often are traditional American Values such as home and family. "Nothing is worth losing one's life for" I think is a bad attitude that has resided in our society for the past three decades or more. "Make Love not War" seams to have replaced any moral values we once had as a society. "The risking of the lives of eight men" to find one is a scenario that troubles those who think in this purely secular way. I'm certainly greatful to those of that earlier generation that were called upon to fight. Something I don't think the later could do even if confronted with such a threat to personal freedoms that Nazi Germany represented at that time.This is a great show for older Teens (14-15 and older). To those who feel this show should have received an NC-17 rating take a look at your thinking as stated above. If the MPAA had a split R rating as most other Nations Ratings Boards have, Mr. Spielberg I'm sure would argue and I would agree that it should go into the lower of the two (MA or M-14). If you're a moral person you'll like this show and the story of heroism, courage and honor it brings to the screen, but if you're a purely secular person with more humanist values you won't. I too feel it was the greatest heist that "Shakespeare in Love" narrowly edged it out for best picture for 1998. But then I'm sure that those with the values opposite to mine felt otherwise ---David Moore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best War Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what the heck the folks at the Oscars were thinking. I still can't believe that Shakespeare in Love got Best Picture at the Oscars in 1998. Shakespeare in Love is a good movie, but nowhere near as powerful and thought-provoking as Saving Private Ryan. The fact that this movie didn't win Best Picture is a crime.I have seen War Movies such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and The Thin Red Line, and none of these movies reaches quite reaches the standard established by Saving Private Ryan (though they are all excellent movies in their own right). The acting, dialogue, and action is top notch. Though some of the movies do come close ,but Saving Private Ryan presents the most disturbing images I have ever seen in a movie of this genre.A friend of mine complains that Speilburg is too cheesy in how he show the American Flag at the end of the movie. There is nothing cheesy about that at all. The flag represents among other things, the people who fought and died in all wars past and present. I hardly call that cheese. He also claims that because it is more uplifting than Full Metal Jacket, that it does not convey to full lengths the reality of war. I agree that it is more uplifting than Full Metal Jacket (though war movies in general are anything, but uplifting), the setting and mood of the war reflect each individual film. Vietnam was the most unpopular war in American History. It had very little support by the masses and the outcome was horrendous for America. The fact that we lost the war at the cost of thousands of lives gave this war a more naturalistic outlook than movies based upon World War 2. In that the war the good guys won as America had a more moral cause to defeat the Axis powers and free the imprisoned and avenge the victims of the Nazi's genocidal regime. This mostly explains why Saving Private Ryan was not as naturalistic as movies that took place in Viet-Nam such as Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.If there was one movie I would ask anyone to see it would be this movie. Saving Private Ryan fulfills masterfully the mood and tragedies of war, and the price of American sacrifice. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started well enough, with the protracted horrors of war on screen, there to teach the audience the cost of war. And then Spielberg, as always, played for sentiment and proceeded to created the best, least-challenging, war-patriotism movie on record. It was well acted, made, and stunning to behold. It just offers nothing new...and fails as a lesson about war. Spielberg...sigh...I just can't get excited about the guy. I know what he's going to do...The Starship Troopers comparison is good, the bugs = Nazis, but the troopers were Nazis too. It isn't that private ryan were evil, but you can see the way propaganda runs its course in media. I remember the audience cheering for the sniper all the way. That doesn't sound like the horror of war stuck with anyone. Patriotism is a good thing, but maturity as an audience involves recognizing our flaws too.And thats why we have movies about Vietnam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Politics has come to be associated with dishonesty and greed but we should never forget that the sacrifices depicted in this film were necessary because Europe had been "de-politicized" by the Nazis.I shudder whenever I hear proposals to "de-politicize" elected positions such as District Attorney, County Administrator, etc. or the creation of special tax rate setting "committees". We have vowed never to forget the human suffering of the concentration camps but we seem to have already forgotten the reason those beaches were stormed. The world did not yet know the truth of Nazi atrocities on D-day. Those free men who gave so much only knew that a de-politicized Europe had de-humanized its citizens.To avoid the same mistakes, we should make this film required viewing in all High School history courses--then give thanks to those Heroes who made "politics" possible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made. It came out providing competition to another good war film "The Thin Red Line" but for those who know what they're talking about, it's obvious the latter didn't even put up a contest. The first 28 minutes of SPR are a work of art. If you think otherwise then try and do it better yourself. The manner in which it is filmed has influenced other films such as "Gladiator". In regards to the comments some make saying that the film is to "USA", have you noticed that the film follows A GROUP OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS!!! It is about their struggle amidst certain events like D-Day. As for cliches, what isn't a cliche today? To say that human struggle when young, watching your friends due around you, not knowing if it's your turn to die tomorrow, watching not just people's homes but their lives destroyed by a war is not a cliche and for those who think differently, get a humanity transplant.This is a gripping film that makes you part of the group, a compatriot in this mission and not many films allow you to get so close to the characters. A cliche ridden film is the remake of "The Thin Red Line" by Terrance Malick, but true masterpiece, true emotion is found in the story of Capt. John H Miller, a man who has lost so many men under his command, who tries to save one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most realistic WWII movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time. It was very good, but nowhere near that good. It probably qualifies as the one of best WWII films made after 1970. There were dozens of great films with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds.The story was about a rescue mission to find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive, because all his brothers had been killed in the war. The platoon was commanded by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who had to take his men through enemy controlled territory to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon). It is a combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than about Private Ryan himself. Other than Captain Miller, there wasn't very much character development, but there was a good deal of time devoted to the human dynamics within the platoon, which was excellent. What really stands out about this film is the direction. Steven Spielberg has created probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made. The scenes on the beach at Normandy were terrifying. This should be required viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle. Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is unparalleled. The entire ensemble cast did a terrific job. Tom Hanks, as always, was masterful as Captain Miller. He struck just the right balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were going through, and the hard-nosed military man who had to force them to do a job they didn't want to do.I rated this film an 8/10. It wasn't the greatest WWII story ever told, but it may have been the greatest telling of such a story. This film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally gory. It is definitely not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great epic war movie this is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not saying that Shakespeare in Love wasn't a good movie, just that epic films such as ?Ryan are almost always due the Academy Award for Best Picture. The names Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks already have the term `Academy Award winner' in front of them, and when you get both of those big names together, you get the best picture made in 1998.Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, a high school English teacher sent off to fight in the war. The movie opens with a very dramatic 15 minute `massacre' on the beach. Miller, along with his company of troops, takes out a group of German soldiers manning a huge gun spraying bullets on the rest of the allies. After the battle, Miller learns of his new orders of seeking out a soldier by the name of Ryan. It seems this Private James Francis Ryan is the last of 4 sons sent to fight in the war. The other 3 sons have been killed and the U.S. Army deemed it necessary to extract the last of the Ryan brothers before he is ultimately killed as well. There is a very poignant scene where Ryan's mother receives a message delivered by some Army diplomats telling her that 3 of her sons have died. This is a very well put together story, all the way down to how difficult it would actually be to find a paratrooper in WWII.Tom Sizemore (Sgt. Michael Horvath), Vin Diesel (Pvt. Adrian Caparzo), Giovanni Ribisi (Medic Irwin Wade), and Matt Damon (Pvt. James Ryan) round out this star-studded cast. By far the best performance is by, of course, Tom Hanks. His ability to act in any surrounding; be it on top of the Empire State Building (Sleepless in Seattle), in cyber-space (You've Got Mail), or in a department store jumping on a large foot piano (Big) Tom Hanks is definitely one of today's greatest actors. Saving Private Ryan takes us on a trip across the battlefields to find Pvt. Ryan and get him home to the states. The film has some very dramatic sub-stories and a few slightly funny scenes. Steven Spielberg very carefully created a movie that will have you shocked from the seriousness of the opening scene, to laughing at some of the lines, to crying from some of the very sad moments of this film.The vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski made this epic film what it is. The camera angles used created the feeling of actually being there next to Vin Diesel as he is taking out the enemy sniper. Due to the heroics shown in the opening sequence, we develop a likening with the main characters especially Capt. John Miller, and throughout the film, we are told more and more about their backgrounds. Another very cleaver addition to this film if that the Captains men have this continuing bet going about Capt. Millers personal background; and by the middle of the movie we are told what it is he did before being sent to fight in this war. When the Academy Awards handed out the award for Best Director to Steven Spielberg, I was happy, and just waiting for them to announce ?Ryan the Best Picture also. However, when they called out Shakespeare in Love as the Best Picture winner, I was stunned! To reiterate, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, just that if Spielberg was deemed the best director, how come his film wasn't considered the best of the year? It's no surprise that I'm not a fan of giving the Best Director award, and Best Picture award to two different pictures as they have done in many years including ?27-?28, '56, '81, and most recently '89. It just doesn't sound right to me. With all that said, there are a few mistakes in the film as every movie does; however Saving Private Ryan is definitely one of the greatest epic films joining the ranks of Braveheart, and Schindlers List. This movie must not be missed by anyone who calls themselves human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the day I went to see First Blood in the theaters. I thought that it was a good movie with plenty of character development and a simple storyline. However, when Rambo II came out...there was such an outcry because it was being racist in the way it portrayed the arabs. It was much too violent too. There were protests in the street and news articles in the magazines devoted two-page spreads on the ravages of war. Enter "Saving Private Ryan". I finally saw the movie and was left with my mouth open. Don't get me wrong...I love war movies and I love movies that have a sense of purpose to the killings that go on during the film. However, with this movie it was different. I was left empty. Absolutely no feelings whatsoever once it was over. I really didn't care after a while seeing soldiers die or explode for that matter in the heat of battle. It was kinda boring after a while. It's funny, I get more from watching "Scarface" then from seeing this movie. This movie did not have one iota of character development. Not one tiddle. You think that with all the hoopla during the Oscars that it was a good movie...now I know why "Shakespear In Love" won Best Picture...because it was entrenched in emotion and the audience cared for the characters. In Saving Private Ryan I got to the point where I said...who cares. It was long, drawn out and boring. Speilberg should stick with dinosaurs...he gets more responses from them then the actors in this movie (shoot, the dinosaurs were digital or mechanical...there's a clue). What I can't get is that the movie won Speilberg all these world awards for bringing people to the awareness of the ravages of World War II (ah...yeah). "The Thin Red Line" did that too...I didn't see that director honored for his achievement...hmm, maybe because he was trying to make a movie that actually was good and not appealing to award councils. Oh yeah, when I said I got more out of "Scarface" it wasn't a joke...in fact, "Goodfellas" was even better than this movie...and Saving Private Ryan had way more violence then both these 2 movies combined. Anyway, I think that Speilberg should stick with E.T.s and let other directors do the war stuff. Oh yeah, when this movie was over I thought..."Gee, all I have to do is make a movie with a historical context and I be a famous director". Nah...I'd rather go back and watch Rambo movies, they are much more docile.</fullReview>

The camera work was superb and it was as close to being in combat as you will ever get without being a soldier. Too many war movies try too hard to grind an axe; we are the good guys, or war is bad, or war is heroic, or something. Saving Private Ryan allows us to see heroism without making war an adventure, shows us about courage while showing understanding of cowardice, and teaches us about the carnage of war without detracting from the fact that sometimes it needs to be fought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Great, despite criticisms (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time, and it is a great one. Like all great movies, it has unfortunately become prone to backlash and criticism. I think that almost all of it is unfair; the movie is brilliant, and it is not supposed to be a `typical' war film. Instead of talking about the film itself, I actually feel compelled to defend this masterpiece.First of all, what people bash more than anything are its `bookends' in the military cemetery. Every war movie has its own theme-`Full Metal Jacket' was about men dehumanized into killers, `Gallipoli' was about soldiers as individuals, and SPR is about the sacrifices that WWII veterans made that we no longer appreciate. The `bookends' would not have worked in `The Thin Red Line,' or `Apocalypse Now,' but they are necessary here. True, they are a little overly sappy, and the Ryan family's girls are so attractive it is distracting. But one of the major points of this movie is that many of us have forgotten what the veterans of this war did for us, and that we no longer appreciate the sacrifices they made. Far too often do younger people look at those from the war generation with indifference and disrespect. I am a WWII buff, and ever since I started reading about it in high school, I was always bothered by the fact that nobody seemed to care about it. The faded flags that open and close the movie are not symbols of patriotism-they are our fading appreciation for WWII veterans' sacrifices. I am happy that SPR brought a renewed interest in this subject.SPR is about the American GI's experiences in WWII Europe, and Spielberg is not claiming with this film that people of other nations did not help or die fighting fascism with us. The Second World War almost covered the entire globe. I would never complain about the lack of Americans in `Soldier of Orange,' or `Hope and Glory,' two great films that are about the Dutch and British experiences, respectively.SPR is not as black and white as many people claim it is. The Germans are not all `EVIL MONSTERS' in this movie; Isn't it Americans who sadistically shoot Germans (actually Czechs) who are most obviously surrendering? The `Steamboat Willie' Character is just a soldier doing his job--he later comes back and shoots Americans, after Miller's squad released him (and NO, he is NOT the SS Trooper that stabs Mellish with a bayonet!) Miller made the mistake of letting `Steamboat Willie' go, because it seemed the `decent thing to do.' But was it? A POW who is let go cannot be expected to surrender--what do we expect him to do? Tell his army upon meeting them that he can no longer shoot at Americans? According to the Video Hound book on war movies, the SS Trooper who stabs Mellish tells him, in German, `Don't fight it. Soon this will be over. You're going to a better place.' He is mercifully killing his enemy. He also lets Col. Upham live, since Upham poses no threat to him. This soldier is a good soldier, unfortunately on the opposite side. To many, it may seem like the Germans are depicted as monsters in this movie. But we must look deeper, and remember that men under fire don't really care what nice guys their enemies are outside of war. And comments like, `The German army were not Nazis. They were just soldiers' are as much generalizations as saying `all Germans were Nazis.' There were plenty of Nazis in the Wehrmacht. As far as I know, SPR was well received in Germany. Spielberg was honored with an award there shortly afterward.This movie is anything but unrealistic. I think I even saw a claim on the IMDB that it was fake because `Soldiers would never storm Normandy without air and artillery support.' Guess what? They did! Normandy was an awful mess! Heavy cloud cover and fear of killing their own soldiers prevented the US from defeating the defenses at Omaha, and lead to the ultra-realistic slaughter depicted in the first half-hour of the movie.Some have called the actions of the Germans in the final sequence (one of the greatest I have ever seen), `unrealistic,' and `unintelligent.' At this point in the war, the German army was in no position to carry out proper by-the-book battle tactics. They were under Hitler's stubborn orders to `hold at all costs' and were sent on many suicidal missions like this one. It was so bad that by the time of the Battle of the Bulge, Americans were appalled at the way that German soldiers marched right up a road, in broad daylight to the front. Historian Steven Ambrose said that Americans had no choice but to open fire on the columns, and mow them down "like a scythe cutting wheat!" Besides, Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, and Privates, etc. on both sides make horrible mistakes, and this war was no exception. As for the plot of this movie, one historian described it as `Very possible, but not very probable.' Take the case of Fritz Niland of the 501st PIR. All three of his brothers were killed in combat, in different divisions. Luckily, high officials in the US army knew where he was, and they had him sent home, immediately.I don't see how anyone could not be affected by the opening sequence on Omaha Beach. It is clearly amazing. Actual veterans have offered their medals and patches to Spielberg because of it. The climactic battle sequence is absolutely unforgettable. I've seen it so many times, yet it is still difficult to watch. It is incredibly suspenseful, frustrating, explosive, horrifying, and shocking, yet it is all beautifully and coherently filmed. When Miller tells Ryan to `earn this,' he is also speaking to us, to the generations born after WWII, who have to respect what the veterans have done.Most of us haven't `been there,' and we will never be able to say that we know what combat is like. But Spielberg has pleased veterans in creating a movie that depicts their experiences as well as a movie possibly can. SPR is a wonderful movie that will always be remembered, and that's worth more than any Oscar award it could have received.</fullReview>

This movie was so powerful that it makes all other war movies seem unrealistic. It is hard to put into words the feelings I went through while viewing this movie. I will never look at older people the same way after seeing this film. What we owe them is everything we have. Our lives, our freedom, and our way of life. I understand that this was an American film and I only wish that they could have shown a little more of the sacrifices our allies had to go through. I can only say, in the movies defense, that most of the younger English and other Europeans already understand the hell their nations went through during WWII, where as this was a learning experience for most Americans. We tend to take our freedom for granted, like it is a gift from God, but it is movies like this that show us that our way of life is something that the generations before us had to fight and die for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private RyanDIRECTION 100% If you can find a better dramatic war action film than this please give me a ring. Flawless and impeccable with room to bring the viewer into the action in the two major war scenes. The small incidents still manages to pull you into the tension. A well deserved oscar win in this category!ACTING 91% Upham and Hanks leads the way in the emotional scenes, perhaps more could have been expected from other characters.EDITING/PSPECIAL EFFECTS 98% Supreme and impressive war scenes. The first 20mins are the most memorable and exciting, the director manages to pull the WHOLE cinema into the movie and won't let you lot go until everyone either dies or they just managed to live.PLOT 72% Not complex, but neither is it too simple as emotional scenes and characters tell their own story on how they are reacting to the challenges of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Not all war movies need to have detail plot-lines!STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC 94% The action is stronger than the words, it may give you nightmares; but at least you will know how it felt to be on the beach. Best seen and heard on the BIG screen.MUSIC 76% There for the quiet and victorious moments.SOUND 99% With the surround sound effects hitting you with virtual bullets and explosions will your senses survive in the cinema?HOOKABILITY 99% As soon as you see the bodies drop you will be running for cover!LASTABILITY 87% You will want to see the ending if continuing the mission was worth the trouble.OVERALL 90% Just manages to get to this golden mark, only on virtue of it's technical merits and placing the viewer on the screen for the first time in a cinema setting; instead of its oral drama on-screen, even though this was exceptional in places, right Mr Upham! Why this movie felt it needed to distort history by implying that America saved the world from Hitler with non NATO style American flag waving will put off the most sincere film goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American War?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least on video/DVD you can fastwind through the pointless graveyard scene that opens and closes the movie. The rest of the film is surprisingly moving, so long as you suspend disbelief enough to accept that the army would ever launch such a rescue mission.The battle sequences are really unlike any other war movie I've seen; graphic and disturbing, rather than cheap gung-ho thrills. The handheld camera work draws you in and really makes you feel as if you're there experiencing it first-hand and the bleach-bypass effect gives the whole film a suitably cold and bleak look.My only concern is that millions of Americans of my generation and younger might think that World War II was fought only between Americans and Germans. I am eternally grateful for the intervention of the US in World War II and I understand why the film revolves around a group of American soldiers, but the fact that no reference was made to the British Forces (who saw the war through from beginning to end) leaves an extremely bitter taste in the mouth.What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but overrated and aggravating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel compelled to finally say something about this film. I saw it in the theaters when it first came out, and rented on video. I'll admit it was good, but to call it the greatest war movie ever made is a major overstatement. First of all, didn't anyone notice how badly Spielberg ripped off Kurosawa? That alone I found rather disappointing. Second, the blatant and heavy handed symbolism. Come on, we just watched people get blown to bits, do we really need to stare at an American flag? Is the American public so dense they couldn't get it?Third, okay I realize Private Ryan was a *symbol*, but WWII was real. To say that after filming some very intense, real images of war we need a symbol to understand what all those millions of people died for? Was the military so lax the day after D-Day that they could waste their time tracking down some young kid to make mommy feel better? Why not ship the whole army back home and forget about Europe?When you get right down to it, SPR is nothing more than a feel good Disney-fied version of war. There are many of fine, outstanding films about war, All Quiet on the Western Front, Platoon, The Thin Red Line, Escape from Sobibor, Ran, Apocalypse Now. Heck, Apocalypse Now was full of symbolism, but it didn't hide behind the pretense of realism.</fullReview>

The film follows the standard Hollywood war movie pattern: American boys being heroes, some sentimentality, some victims, some blood, some bad guys and so on.I expected more by Spielberg than making sure the movie goes well at the box office. A lost chance, could have been the ultimate war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most outstanding movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the brilliance of the war-scenes, and they are truly amazing, this movie still has too many "Spielberg"- moments. For me, the film is stylistically schizophrenic, he should have used the documentary-style all the way through. Now he falls between two chairs, making the movie feel disjointed and unbalanced. What irritates me is that he could and should have been more consistent in tone, he of all directors certainly could afford more experimentation. Now it has moments of genius, and moments of cheesy standard Spielberg-sentimentality, and a paradoxical pro-war message: war makes you grow as a person. Very good performances (but a questionable Matt Damon) and striking photography and sound, but unfortunately not as good as it should have been.</fullReview>

Yes, the landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day was realistic, to say the least, but it showed what the men of WWII actually experienced better than any book could possibly do. Stephen Ambrose, the WWII historian and consultant on the film, has given it the highest marks for realism. If anyone has any idea of what it means to be an American, of how invaluable our freedom is, of the sacrifice that our forefathers made, let them watch SPR and feel no doubt. Undoubtedly the best picture of 1998!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why ruin a good film with a predictable mess of a story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? It had such potential! It has some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed! But WHY did they have to include such a banal plot that manages to send dual messages that contradict themselves in the worst way possible. Sure, when speaking of the technical aspects of the film, it is in fact a great achievment, and the acting is above average. But Spielberg packs into so full of repulsive nationalism, especially during the later part of the film, that when the final frame appeared I almost want to throw up in disgust towards the overblown cliches that populate this film. And then we have the thing that has always kept Spielberg off my list of outstanding filmmakers, the film is so sentimental it almost caused me to start yelling obscene words at the screen. Plus, the film is way too long, and VERY predictable. But it is worth seeing for the great cinematography, acting, editing and the battle sequences. Can you guess if I think this is one of the best films about war ever made? Do I really think that about the film? Hell no. It's a pretty good film, all in all, it's better than most films Spielberg has made since "Raiders of the Lost Arc", not nearly as good as "Schindler's List" though. If you compare it to the likes of "Missing in Action" it looks great, but when it faces the likes of "Apocalypse Now", "Full Metal Jacket", "Salvador" and "Bullet in the Head", it's DOA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is excellent. Except for one respect. The toning in of the Stars and Stripes at the beginning and the end. Unnecessary, egocentric and downgrading. Most people who fought and died in WW2 were Europeans...The thing that really made this film, is the opening sequence. The first 30 minutes are brilliant, horrifying and historical. Never, ever has war been depicted in such a realistic manner. It's genuine and true - not John Wayne waltzing out from the landing craft with the bullets whipping past him and his brave men. This is what it was like.Other than that, this film is not too original. Most of the Germans are anonymous and disgusting, and even though the poor sod who gets to dig his own grave turns out to be a real b****rd. And there is one part I REALLY don't like: why on Earth does the guy they're looking for want to stay? It's irrational and unthinkable.But all in all - this is a great movie. Not all too believable - but nonetheless, a realistic war movie. Just get rid of those flags, you guys!</fullReview>

That battle at the end of this movie, any good officer would know you DON'T send tanks in first into a built up area like a city you send in Infantry to find enemy positions first.When is some one going to make an honestly accurate war movie?

		<fullReview>As the opening sequence begins, you cannot help but have a feeling of dread as the date appears on the screen, "June 6, 1944" The opening sequence has got to be one of the best put on film. The jarring camera movements, the bullets shooting through the water, the absolute chaos of D-day is masterfully captured. Some people called it uselessly gory, comparing it to "Glory" with its battle scenes. Glory was a great movie, but comparing the Civil War to D-Day isn't the brightest thing to do. Once we realize the mission, we hear the men complaining, "Why is one life worth risking eight of ours". I wondered that as well, but you soon understand that it isn't the point.  The backlash says that the characters are paper thin, and that the story is s--t. I disagree with both points. All these characters have depth (with the possible exception of Private Ryan). The story, while I agree that the screenplay is not oscar-worthy, is actually not told as a plot story, but as a series of events that take place (D-day, the battle at the hill with the machine gunners, the final battle). The acting does range, and is not always great. Hanks does give a good performance, in a role that is not his type (aka. not Forrest Gump). Edward Burns does give a good performance, but the two best belong to Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies. Davies' meltdown sequence on the staircase left me reeling. I saw it in theatres over a year ago, and on video yesterday, and was stunned about how much detail I remember. In my opinion, this film is the best of the year (beating A Simple Plan and Elizabeth).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As few others have done before him, Steven Spielberg depicts war as the true nightmare that it is. No glamorization here; Sherman's phrase "war is hell" seems like a day at the beach compared to what we see in "Saving Private Ryan." The only other film I can recall that delineates war to be as horrific as it appears in "Ryan" is Kubrick's "Paths of Glory," albeit for different reasonsThe cinematography, special effects, sets, and costumes all create a mind-boggling sense of realism. The script is haunting. Phrases just linger in one's mind, such as Captain Miller's rueful observation that every man he kills takes him a little further away from home.Spielberg's direction is just that: direct. There is no dazzling visual trickery here, just naturalistic movie making at it's best. When I left the theater, I felt grateful to the men who fought the fight of WWII.</fullReview>

Show me another movie that entertains me for another two hours after that opening sequence. If you show me that, I'll show you some ocean-front property in Wisconsin. I have seen this movie several times now, and it never fails to move me. The only thing I could possibly complain about is the sappy Grandpa frame story. It is completely unnecessary and contradicts the rest of the movie. But if that's all I've got to complain about, that's okay.Spielberg has made THE masterpiece. But then again, every movie he makes should be a masterpiece. No one else has the funds or the creative freedom that he does. He should never, ever make a bad movie. Give me $100 million and free reign from the censors and I'll give you a watchable movie. Give it to Spielberg, and he'll give you Saving Private Ryan...or Hook (shudder).

		<shortDescription>VERY DISAPPOINTING FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having viewed all of Steven Speilberg films over the years, I was extremely disappointed in Saving Private Ryan. The first hour of the movie was very intense and unique. The D-Day landing was captured with realism and superb direction. Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore give a very good portrayal of men in combat. As the film progressed, it became stagnant and eventually down right boring. From the time they leave the crash site of the airborne paratroppers....to the "Ted Danson" village segment....through the destruction of the heavy machine-gun....right up to meeting Matt Damon as Private Jim Ryan, THE MOVIE BECOMES CONTRIVED, ARTIFICIAL AND PLODDING. In all honesty, I can`t understand what all the fuss is about. At no time did I consider this in any way a patriotic war movie. While Speilberg gives a good directing effort, in no way should this movie be considered in the same class as "Shindlers List". I don`t think it builds very good characterizations. By the final battle scenes, I got the impression these actors were only going through the paces. They had lost that 1940`s feel for the times, that was neatly instilled during the first half of the film. Saving Private Ryan, in my humble opinion, will never rank up there with the greatest war films of all time. Even "Full Metal Jacket" with its second half letdown, was a superior motion picture endeavor then Saving Private Ryan. The best war films about 20th. century conflicks ever produced are: THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI; THE LONGEST DAY; THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES; THEY WERE EXPENDABLE; PATHS OF GLORY; BATTLEGROUND; TWELVE O`CLOCK HIGH; FROM HERE TO ETERNITY; PATTON; THE DEER HUNTER; APOCALYPSE NOW; A WALK IN THE SUN; GUALALCANAL DIARY; SAHARA; PORKCHOP HILL; IN WHICH WE SERVE; THE DAWN PATROL(1938); IN HARMS WAY; FULL METAL JACKET; OPERATION:BURMA; DESTINATION TOKYO; SAHARA; 30-SECONDS OVER TOKYO; THE STORY OF G.I. JOE. To many observers most of these films are old, in black &amp; white and just not real enough. In my book, realism should be left to the documentaries and people should use their imagination more....films/movies/motion pictures should be more surrealistic than realistic....and of course, above all, ENTERTAINING. There are probably several more I`m overlooking, but these remain the mainstays in the 20th. century war film genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the exception of a few poingant, and incredibly well acted scenes,(i.e.- The storming of the beaches at Normandy and Jeremy Davies cowering in fear on the steps near the end) this film takes on a normal Hollywood stigma. It is honestly a shame that The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan were released in the same year. The Thin Red Line is an Honest depiction of the humanity (or lack there of) of war. While Saving Private Ryan tries this with its "tear-jerker" scenes it just does not have the same effect as The Thin Red Line. Not to saying it's a bad movie.

That is I think one of Spielberg's greatest mistakes: he portrays the events too black and white, as if it were a struggle between the good guys (the US) and the bad guys (the Germans). The movie is more like those old westerns: a group of cowboys/colonists etc. are attacked by some Indians (also traditionally the bad boys), but the cavalry (this time the 8th Air Force) is in time and everyone is happy. Of course, Spielberg being pretentious enough, the hero will die. Combined with visual goodies, it really shows, I suppose, what war is about, and so Spielberg makes a statement; if you don't agree with him you are a warmonger. But he focuses too much on the conduct of war than on the impact of war on human mind. Therefore, I consider it as just a warmovie, not less, but certainly not more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When will Steven Spielberg learn to trust his own talent as a filmmaker? Why has he managed to ruin the endings of his two best films? The "stones on the grave" scene at the end of Schindler's List and the "Ryan as old man" scene at the beginning AND end of Saving Private Ryan were gratuitous and totally unecessary. It's like he said, "OK. I've made a three hour movie showing in explicit detail how awful racial hatred and/or was is. But, just in case there's one idiot in that theatre that has missed the point, I'll end it with a sappy ending to make sure everybody's crying." This is the Penny Marshall influence on Spielberg's directing.Without the unecessary scenes, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan may both have merited 10's in my book. With the scenes, they are a 9 and an 8, respectively. Steven, bubby, just tell your story. Leave the moralizing and tear-jerking to lesser filmmakers. Give the audience a little credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "ANTI" in the expression "Anti-War-Movie" and why SPR is not one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I consider this movie a very good war movie.But, after all, it IS a classic American war movie resembling other classic war movies like Bridge On The River Kwai etc. What disturbed me, is the general view of this movie being an Anti-War-movie. The origin of this categorization is without a doubt the acceptance of Steven Spielberg as a sophisticated director. If another director had created a movie with such realistic scenes as featured in SPR, the movie would probably be seen as violent and war-glorifying. Spielberg does SPR and it is automatically an Anti-War-movie, that `realistically displays the cruelty of war, showing us what never may happen again'. How can it be otherwise? It is a Spielberg movie. In my eyes ridiculous and unfair to the directors who are not as established as Spielberg.In a movie against war the first thing that should be dropped is Patriotism in order to reflect on war objectively. SPR starts with an American flag waving in the wind. There is hardly more Patriotism possible. An objective movie does not require clichees like the evil Nazi soldier who cold-heartedly shoots American soldiers even after they spared his life. Despite of the indubitable fact that the Nazi regime was one of the most gruesome periods in world history, we also have make the assumption, that in battle all soldiers are the same: Humans fighting for a country.By the way, the only movie I have seen that definitely could tell a war story without sticking to just one side was The Thin Red Line. The problem was that Terrence Malick is not Steven Spielberg.So, again, in my eyes a really great movie. But let us see things as they are: Just because Spielberg made it doesn´t make it a sophisticated Anti-War-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody should watch it. Some people may say it's great. Other people will say they can't stand more Spielberg films...Who cares?Watch the movie. And, if you realize you're crying, don't be ashamed. You don't need to admit it in public.After that, you can say what you wish to say. You can say it's great, or that you hate it, or that it's boring (?), or whatever you wish. It doesn't matter too much, because the important thing is that more and more people realize how a war is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks Credibility, Impact and a decent cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This represents a great lull in Steven Spielberg's illustrious career. A collossol disapointment in almost ever aspect. The biggest problem though is the casting of recognisable faces such as Tom Hanks and Matt Damon. If Spielberg had chosen unknown actors he would have been able to reach emotional chords with the audience that wasn't achieved. Tom Hanks reaches emotional depth by squinting, Matt Damon by whining. The film's opening blood bath on the beach is a powerful image reinforced by many of the key scenes. But the film becomes bogged down in it's middle with prolonged memoirs and later in a lack lustre climatic battle.After this film I was left trying to like it but in the end gave up. I believe Spielbergs directions of the battle scenes were oscar worthy but as for the rest it wasn't. A great disappointment from a first rate director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the first half hour is great maybe even brillian...nah. Great. I even have problems with the opening stormin' beach scene but anyways...Before the film started on opening day(I add this to let you know I'm a Fan of Mr S.) one of my friends beside me said, "if this opens or closes with some hokey memorial thing I'm outta here!" Well, we didn't leave but we got it in BOTH the beg AND end. Geesh. and I don't buy that Ryan's an everyman crap. It's not like they're supposed to be meeting Brando in "Apocalypse Now" Hey, he doesn't have to be crazy-like Brando just oh, I don't know, interesting.Mr. S has shown with his last three dramatic works that he does DEAD or rather the act of killing better than anyone. Great. Shocking and all that other stuff but how about ya know, the living? I don't consider myself a "girly-man" but Hell Yeah, Shakespeare in Love was better than Ryan. And another thing, that opener has flaws too, like the center shots of the men with their "look at me, I've got my guts spillin'" oooooh. indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film everybody should see...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it has a fairly simplistic plot, this film manages to do what only one other war film I have ever seen has done: it has recreated the battlefield so that the viewer is not witnessing it, but is a part of it. This movie features well drawn-out characters trapped in an incredibly brutal and all-too-real situation: they must survive the greatest hell ever to exist on Earth.Their mission is to rescue one man, who is the last of his line. Private Ryan's brothers have all died in combat, and he now has a free ticket home. However, he has to be found first, and a team of soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks)travels around the lines of the D-Day invasion looking for him.But the real reason for seeing this has nothing to do with the plot. As far as plots go, it is a fairly simplistic one, despite the fact that these basic events really did happen. The film suffers slightly as the ancient morality of "the other guys are the bad guys" sets in, making it slightly less horrifying than it could have been. However, the real reason for seeing this is the experience. The viewer is AT D-Day and the following chaos, watching as soldiers get their brains blown out before they even have a chance to get out of the landing craft. Watching this film is an experience of walking through hell, and no viewer can come out of it without being changed.This is a film everybody should see at least once. 4.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially decent movie that was ruined by...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical modern-day-movie predictability and over-dramatization. I'm the kind of person that approaches movies with an open mind, however, certain things may become apparent in these movies which quickly bias my opinion and ruin the movie for me. I can't help it, its how my mind works. As soon as I see something that makes me cynical, I start picking the movie apart. This movie had that effect on me. Realize I'm 29 and have no combat experience.In the opening battle, I wondered why they would attack a fortified position without any "softening up" of said position by either ship-to-shore artillery or at least hand-held heavy weapons. I assumed this was a realistic representation of what really happened (everyone said it was so realistic). For whatever reason they didn't have the necessary firepower. So be it. But then I see, after they've already nearly secured the position (with heavy losses) there is a guy with a rocket-launcher-type weapon. Where the hell was he earlier when the bunker was mowing down everyone?There were numerous other things that put me into cynic-mode:1.) the guy that gets hit in the helmet then just stands there and (very predictably) gets shot in the head. Isnt it a natural reaction to DUCK when you get hit in the head??? 2.) solders shoot surrendering enemies......with friendly troops walking just beyond these enemies. You tell me--at close range, wouldn't one of these rifle bullets go right thru a person and potentially wound another in the line of fire??? Okay maybe these people were just stupid and lucky they didn't injure any friendly troops. 3.) this movie was supposed to be sooooo in-your-face realistic. Did anyone else notice how clean and bleached WHITE Pvt. Ryans teeth were? Oh thats realistic yeah.I could go on. Don't get me wrong there were things I liked. Like the translator that finally hardened to the point where he killed. But overall I couldnt take the movie seriously.And Tom Hanks. He was a pretty poor choice for the role. However, this may have been Spielburg's intention. More realistic maybe?I just watched this movie and Thin Red Line for the first time today (on Direct TV) I'm probably the only one here that liked TRL better (though admittedly that had its flaws too (can you say, under-powered grenades))Oh and for people wondering about the battle scenes. They were shot with hand-held, fast-shutter speed cameras, but the actual speed of the footage was not increased. It was a good effect, but overused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film a year ago, I was completely blown away. I knew people who had seen it said the battle scenes were pretty intense, but it was nothing like I expected. I was in a state of shock as was everyone else at the screening I attended. The two extended battle scenes that open and close the film are, simply, the greatest battle scenes ever recorded on celluloid. The primary reason is because they show absolutely everything. Blood, body parts, gore, you name it. This is easily the most violent film I've ever seen. Can you imagine what the reaction would've been like if this movie came out at the same time "The Wild Bunch" did? I was somewhat surprised that this film sailed through with an "R" rating. The film tells a fairly straightforward story of a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks who are assigned to find and bring back a young soldier whose three brothers have been killed in action. The characters are sharply and simply drawn, the editing is phenomenal, the cinematography is excellent, and the score is appropriate. This is Spielberg's fourth WWII movie, and arguably his best film ever. The only complaint I have about this film is its continued absence on DVD. Please, please, Mr. Spielberg, get this masterpiece out on DVD real soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Should Have Won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see why I even bother adding my comment on this film, there's already, like, 780, or something, but let me just say that Saving Private Ryan should have definately without-a-doubt won best picture of 1998. I mean, who else besides 20-something women REALLY thought Shakespeare was worthy of Best Picture? Come on, people, Saving Private Ryan was the best film in years. I was so sad when seeing the ending of this movie that I was crying. The beginning grabbed you by the heart and wouldn't let you go! I have never seen a war movie better than this. The people saying that all of that violence wasn't necessary had better realize that Saving Private Ryan was only a fraction of how bloody and awful REAL war can be. Speilberg did an excellent job directing this movie, and I felt very sorry that he did not win best picture after all that work. Tom Hanks did an excellent job at his part, and, although the acting was not exactly top-notch, no one in this movie did a bad job at all. Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies, and was ripped off when it came to the Oscars. I don't know how people can hate this movie, say it was bad, or tell me that it was boring. I would watch Saving Private Ryan again any day. Go see this movie!!!!!!!!!**** stars out of ****-2001Rulz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional and timely masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why those who have not yet faced the task of grieving departed ones might see Saving Private Ryan as sappy and feel manipulated by it. There is little doubt that Spielberg wants to impart strong feelings of tragedy and loss in this film - the same authentic tears that surface each day at the Vietnam War Memorial. To my mind he evokes these feelings with as much, if not more intensity than he did in Schindler's List.Few directors block a shot to serve feeling, story and characters as well as the mature Spielberg. And in Private Ryan, he scores emotional bullseyes with devasting power. Unlike George Lucas, whose narrative skills have gotten rusty with disuse, Spielberg continues to work hard at his narrative thoughtfulness, economy and authenticity. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg shows his mature pacing and mastery in numerous scenes - most notably in his shot coverage of the wordless scene in which Private Ryan's mother realizes she's about to be notified about her sons. Spielberg's model here is not "Kelly's Heroes" or other war films, but "The Best Years of Our Lives", the late-forties academy award winner that best enshrined and exorcised the post-war experience for WWII vets and families. (Unlike that epic, Private Ryan deserved but was denied the best film Oscar.) Many cinematic virtues have been attributed to Private Ryan that are to my mind unremarkable. Gritty, realistic action is to be expected from any eight figure 90's battle film. I award Spielberg no points there. Subordinating plot momentum to explore characters episodically is risky, but it's still not a stretch. What is a stretch, and would be for any director, is achieving the utter respect, reverence and quietude the average viewer leaves the theater with just fifteen minutes after the sense-numbing climactic battle scenes are over. This is primarily because Private Ryan's opening and closing scenes bracket the cinematic tour de force with a much quieter and still-current personal reality. How many were saved in similar sacrifices? How did my own father or grandfather survive? When we realize what is truly owed, we're all humbled. The open and pliant soul who has known grief and loss first-hand and who watches this masterwork cannot help but reconsider the sacrifice of a generation of young men - and the connection between those young men on the screen and the very real 75 year old men still walking our streets.It is this accomplishment, this bridge that Spielberg built between three generations of twentieth century Americans that impresses me. It's a film that had to come when it did - for us living now. Although future generations may benefit from watching Private Ryan, by then the generation portrayed on screen will have passed away. For now, they are still with us and have stories to tell. Private Ryan awakened my gratitude to them.Call Private Ryan sappy if you like. I know it left a fingerprint on my heart deeper and more meaningful than ET ever did. For those of you who don't get it, I hope you'll ask your grandparents and listen to their stories while they're still alive. Maybe you'll relate more personally to the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an instant classic. I loved it, it shows WWII in a very real way. It doesn't mention the atrocities of Hitler because they are already showed in so many movies, instead it show the atrocities of war. The first minutes of the movie are the most stunning that I've ever seen specially because its based on real events. This movie show the soldiers of both bands ( allies and germans ) as human beings , this is refreshing because most war movies pictures one side as pure evil. and the other side as the good guys, Specially WWII movies but this movie shows that not all german soldiers were jew-hating Hitler-loving killing machines with no soul. I liked Shakespeare in Love but I think this movie should've won the oscar. It has everything you want in a movie, good acting, good story and good special effects. The main characters are well-developed and you feel you know them. If you ever cry at movies you will cry.I would recommend it to anyone except children</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, it should be: "Save The Movie-Lovers from Spielberg". This guy has transformed shlock into an art-form. And, yes, it might sound blasphemous; but, his only talent is making lots of money for himself and the studios whose only real passion is to produce movies devoid of any intellectual or visceral resonance - and, of course, make heaps of moola.It's insidious, and ultimately depressing, as to how Spielberg has almost single-handedly transformed - if not perverted - the standards as to what essential elements and themes constitutes a good movie into his own interpretation of what is movie-art. He has hijacked the obsequious movie-critics - and astonishingly, the movie-going public in the process - into his web of movie-making 'excellence''Saving Private Ryan' is nothing less than tawdry American propaganda; not unlike, how a war comic - of 40 years ago - would present and define the events of war in its most narrow and simplistic form. The main characters are stereotyped; depiction of emotions are synthetic and one-dimensional; the treatment accorded to them in character development is quintessentially 'Spielberg': Contrived, predictable, formulaic, and cynically manipulative, to squeeze every ounce of emotion out of an uncritical audience.Zinnemann, Capra, Wise, Wyler, Lean, Kubrick and all the other great deceased directors, must be turning over in their graves.And, all the others still around must be in a state of stupor over all the accolades that have been showered on this over-feted, over-rated, prodigious money-maker. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying Spielberg Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I watched this with apprehension, as I firmly believe that Tom Hanks should stick to doing comedy (The Burbs, Dragnet) and Spielberg hasn't made film better than Jaws in his whole career. Anyway, this film is over-rated. Sure the opening scenes are shocking and brutal. This is to show what war was really like, apparently. We all know what war was really like, so who cares?Spielberg cannot decide whether to make a totally serious war film or a sentimental heart tugging Oscar winner. So he tries both. The comedy of the bumbling interpreter is out of place, and the sniper's amazing shot through the sight of another sniper's gun is plain ridiculous. Even more so, the feelgood ending made me want to vomit.Bizarrely, Saving Private Ryan seems to be a shameless rip off of the Eastwood/Sutherland/ Savalas classic Kelly's Heroes. The end scenario is too similar to be coincidence, with the tank ambush, the radio music and the sniper in the bell tower. I spent the whole 2 and whatever hours thinking 'its Kelly's Heroes, but without the humour or the superb acting!'While Saving Private Ryan is highly watchable, it is by no means a classic.Watch Kelly's Heroes instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Writing an anti war book is like writing an anti glacier book." -a (sort of) quote from Slaughterhouse 5Commendable for it's use of realistic ground level shaky camera angles in the beginning and end battle scenes, this film really does bring the horrors of war home. The depiction of the unfair randomness of the conflict, and the gruesome results, are truly superb. On a par with certain scenes in Hamburger Hill and Stalingrad in it's ability to discourage volunteering for military service. I defy anyone to leave the theatre after seeing this film and not feel as though someone has really spoken out to them.However, this graphic depiction of war does come with a fair amount of Hollywood baggage. Noteworthy scenes include the ones with the present day Private Ryan, Officers back in America and the bit where Hanks says "saving-Private-Ryan" which I objected to on general principles. Despite these scenes, this film still has to rank up there with some of the best executed anti war films around. I would personally recommend Stalingrad more strongly if only because it had the same "shock factor" and came without the cheese.</fullReview>

Oh well, if they want horror, cruelty, and moral vacuum symbolised by the Stars and Stripes that's fine by me. But it turned what was potentially a worthwhile film into a bit of a farce, although empty headed middle America will appreciate it. I was never sure about Tom Hanks but now its clear that he's only good at sitting round with his head in a spin. Save the first half hour for excellent "documentry" footage to teach the ones in power about the cruel nature of war. Save the rest of it for serialisation on daytime TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son rented "Saving Private Ryan" last night and I watched it even though I had no real interest to do so, because I had heard that Steven Spielberg forgot to include a Black or Hispanic in the movie. If he did his homework he would see that during one of these major invasions, a Black medic was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for treating other wounded soldiers though he himself was constantly being wounded as he kept going from soldier to soldier.One thing, though, in the beginning of the movie while the old man is visiting the grave of his fallen comrade, you can see the real name of a Hispanic soldier by the name of Martinez or Ramirez as I recall, on one of the cross. I guess Steven Spielberg over looked that one. On another note, others have commented about our allies not being in this movie, and I can understand why Spielberg did what he did but, keeping us other Americans out is a disgrace to all those Blacks and Hispanics that fought and died for this great Country of ours. If I was to meet Mr. Movie Maker himself, I would ask him: "Hey,what happened to us Blacks and Hispanics?" And if anyone else out there feels that what I'm saying is a crock of s***, well, all I have to say is that I'm a Vietnam Combat Wounded Veteran and a Hispanic at that. I know what combat is and the fear that goes through your mind as you look for the enemy in the jungle, and more when you find him. You find yourself doing things you would never have imagined, and how close you become to other soldiers, whether they are black,red,brown, white or green. I must honestly say,though, that I did enjoy the movie and felt sad when ever a soldier was killed, for I've been there. But being that this movie was to Honor The World War Two Veterans,along with all other veterans,we forgive you Spielberg.</fullReview>

Yes I was totally blown away by the opening scene. The end was powerful as well. The middle was boring.The difference between the two movies is in the writing and acting. SIL is a very witty movie well acted. SPR relies on technical wizardry to bring out the emotions. Don't get me wrong, the wizardry works in this movie, and boy does it work. The writing in SPR just wasn't there. The "bonding" was extremely forced. And the one thing that trivializes the emotional impact is the sentimental ending. I could not believe the fact that I was being told how to feel at the end of the movie. Did we need the scene in the cemetery just to tell us that we should feel for this man? We already do.While I agree with SIL winning best picture, I also agree with Steven Spielberg's Directorial Oscar. This man used the technilogical tools of filmmaking to give SPR the impact that it does.I plan on buying both movies when they come out on DVD. SPR will sound awesome on my home theater.If I had to rate both movies, I would say SPR is an 8 out of 10 versus SIL a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this simple--"Saving Private Ryan" is the REAL Best Picture of 1998.I admit this--I loved "Shakespeare in Love." But as I was walking out of the theater after seeing it, I thought it was the second-best movie I had seen in '98."Shakespeare" didn't deserve Best Picture. Why? Because the film did nothing that couldn't be done in a Play. Everything that happened in that film could have been reproduced on a stage. And this may be considered a personal bias, but a film that could honestly be a stage production should not be remotely competitive for film awards when it's up against the likes of the shocking and fantastic FILM work of "Ryan."Additionally, I have another personal bias. I believe a Best Picture should transcend the material seen on screen. It should have an emotional impact--it should touch the viewer in a way where it becomes much more than a movie for the viewer. And let's face it; "Shakespeare" was well-done, but it's only a well-done story that doesn't have much to say beyond the screen. However, I think we all know how much impact "Ryan" had beyond the actual film itself.The academy got it wrong. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I've seen that Tom Hanks handled remotely well. Many things made it better than most war movies, but the final shoot-out was just like any other war movie. Would all those guys really have been out there without helmets? Did they have to take them off so we could tell which character was which?I know the English will be upset that there was no reference to the other nations taking part mostly because they ignore even the Scottish in their view of THE war between Germany and England, but that's no excuse for Spielberg to leave out any reference to the many other nations taking part. We don't have to have a whole series of characters but they could have been mentioned in the dialogue. Some of the Irish soldiers used as extras could have been Australians or Canadians or whatever.Seems like there was good reason to leave out the smoke on the beach but did it have to be replaced with the numerous fires that continued to burn during the pouring rain?The character of the corporal was well written and acted and the morphing at the end was good, but I would have liked it more if geographical and historical details had been more accurate and the laws of physics hadn't been ignored.</fullReview>

As the son of a retired Army officer and the grandson of a World War II veteran, this movie hit somewhat close to home. Never before have I seen such a realistic portrayal of battle. Anyone who sees this movie should keep in mind the sacrifice men and women have made for them and be reminded not to take simple everyday freedoms for granted. When CPT Miller says to PVT Ryan "Earn this," he is speaking to us all. We must never forget the cost at which our freedom was gained, and never disgrace ourselves and our country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the horrifying opening sequence to "Saving Private Ryan" is probably the best thing Steven Spielberg has ever committed to celluloid, the rest of the movie is highly watchable and entertaining. It is pure Hollywood manipulation, but it is well done.What is worrying is Spielberg's rather distasteful flag waving, which was as depressing as it was distressing. Spielberg is re-writing history, and people are buying it. It is tarnishing the memories of the millions of English, Canadian and French who died during World War II. Spielberg wants us to believe that World War II was the USA against the world, heroes all. What is admirable though, is that Spielberg is getting a horrific depiction of war over to a mainstream audience. He is educating young people about the futility and the anguish of war. This is commendable.Oh, and for all the amazing war footage, I haven't seen anything worse in contemporary cinema than the modern day sequences that bookend the film. This was pure cinematic masturbation. How much more powerful would the ending have been if the elderly Private Ryan just got up, and walked away into the distance with his family? Exactly. What do we get? A truly revolting snatch of sentimental dialogue ("Tell me I've led a good life": Eurghh!!) and a salute to the grave of his Captain. Then a near five minute shot of the American flag.Steven Spielberg, I ask you. First you want to kiss him, then you want to kick him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, the lionisation of Spielberg must stop. He hasn't made a "Classic" film since Jaws. And SPR although interesting, is by no means in that category. My main problem with it comes from Spielberg himself. As a previous user commented, he contradicts himself with his attempt to unglorify war, and yet plaster patriotic and nationalistic symbols all over the screen. The 'war is pointless' theme is a meritable one, but in painting the US soldiers to be victims, there is no thought to the feelings of the ordinary German soldiers, who were surely experiencing the same fears. They are portrayed as ruthless, cold-blooded and evil.Also, Spielberg would have us believe that US won the war on their own. Despite traipsing across French countryside for miles, not one British, Canadian, Australian, French (etc) soldier is seen. The bridge they defended at the end was actually in reality, held by a joint Anglo-American force. Spielberg's reputation is such that historical inaccuracies like these are damaging. As for the opening scene, yes it is involving, spectacular, scary and all the rest. But the camera techniques have been used before by Kubrick and Peckinpah etc. He is not a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I was obviously not part of WWII, or ANY war for that matter. Even so, I have seen some GREAT war movies in my time that made me feel like I was actually there and going through the emotions and struggles that all soldiers experience in battle.So why am I calling Saving Private Ryan overrated when it's been touted as the most realistic war movie ever made? It just didn't have the emotion. Sure, it looked grisly on the screen, especially the first 15 minutes. But I never got a sense that I was there...that I was feeling what Tom Hanks was feeling. In fact, I felt as if I were sitting in a movie theater watching a movie. The special effects in the first 15 minutes were also very bad. I cringed at the corniness whenever they had a scene with a downed soldier playing with his innards. It looked more like spaghetti than intestines and was an obvious device for shock value (which did not work one single bit).The story itself was interesting enough. However, it was very limited, if you think about it. The movie transformed itself from a dramatic war movie to a simple action flick about searching for an ordinary soldier and then taking on an entire German unit with 6 or 7 soldiers. It reminded me more of Rambo than an Oscar-nominated movie.The two best war movies I have ever seen both came out in the same year. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were REAL war movies. I absolutely fell in love with Platoon when I watched it. I actually felt like I was there in the jungle with Charlie company and I knew all the soldiers in my troop. It was an experience. Saving Private Ryan never really puts you there. Instead, it drags you along and makes you follow a bunch of guys walking around the whole movie looking for this private Ryan guy.The movie was "important" because it was about WWII and because Steven Spielberg was involved. Spielberg has reached the status where he can do no wrong and everything he comes out with is considered a masterpiece. If he were to make a film about origami, everyone would suddenly embrace origami as the greatest lost art of our time and there would be conventions and books and tributes about how great origami is.Saving Private Ryan is a product of a well-respected director and actor making the best out of their reputations. As a film, it is certainly not the best movie I've seen, and even not the best I've seen last year (Life is Beautiful and Dark City takes the cake on that). It is more of an action flick than a human drama and mroe about making money than it is about war.While I still enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed it on the same plane as a regular action flick. If put next to a film like Life is Beautiful or Platoon, it certainly takes a back seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I go to the movies, I expect to be transported. When I watch Saving Private Ryan or any other Spielberg movie, such as Schindler's List, I feel strangely detached from everything. Oft-times, his movies have that epic feel, but they don't seem to have captured Spielberg's passion, do they? While I was watching the famed "first 20 minutes," all I could do was look on at the screen, almost indifferent to the violence. Maybe it's because I'm growing up in a society obsessed with violence and bloodshed, but I didn't feel like I was there. I felt like I was watching it 50 years after the fact and it was just very ineffectual to me. The other WWII movie, "Life is Beautiful," however, was created as a much more intimate film with less violence and affected me much more than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindler's List" did. I hope in Spielberg's next film, he puts the story and the characters ahead of the spectacle of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! That's all I could say as I left the theater after seeing Saving Private Ryan, this movie is what film making is all about. As I walked out of the dark theater with my grandfather, who experienced the horror of Omaha Beach first hand over 50 years ago, I turned to him and said, "Was it really like that?" What he told me was just about the best way to describe this movie you can get, he said "Mathew, that movie was just about as close to war as you can get without the fear of taking a bullet." I must say that Stephen Speilberg has outdone himself once again, not only was Saving Private Ryan the best war film ever made, I'm trying to decide if I think it's the best movie ever made. Of course the movie's highest points are the brilliantly realistic war scenes, especially the Omaha Beach scene but the visuals aren't it's only good parts. The story is quite well thought out and the reactions from the charecters are very realistic, ie. The soldiers aren't too happy about having to risk their lives for one private who no one has even heard of. The charecters are very well developed and you really get to know and love (or hate) each and every one of their personalities individually. Speilberg got his point across so well that by the end you're screaming "KILL SOME NAZIS, THEN KILL MORE NAZIS, THEN AFTER THAT KILL EVEN MORE NAZIS." Believable story, amazing visuals, top notch acting, superb directing, touching dialog. All in all a true masterpiece, see this film at all costs I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't all that enthusiastic about paying to see this when it first came out, but as a friend lent me a video CD, I took the time to watch it. The result: a major disappointment.The story is all over the place, not telling a continuous narrative, but a series of escapades that do not remotely further the storyline. Instead they show some ambiguous moralising that simultaneously condemns and celebrates warfare. The story has very little new or original to say beyond the old chestnuts of war being hell and its corruption of humanity.The acting is also fairly lazy. Tom Hanks seems so lacking in talent that gives the impression that he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Matt Damon and the rest of the cast are so laid-back that I suspect most of them are acting in something else on another sound-stage. The opening beach landing, and most of the violent encounters during the remainder of the film are somewhat ludicrous (people burning to death three feet from water; a sniper being shot by a bullet travelling down his scope into his eye; Mellish's death). It doesn't matter if it's realistic, it still looks bizarre. The production is quite good and suitably colourless, but scenery a good film doth not make.In summary, this is a poor film, in which high production values fail to hide a feeble script and indifferent acting. But then almost any film could be guaranteed a big US gross and a clutch of Oscars when it's about American soldiers being "heroic". It is therefore not surprising that Frank Darabont had his name removed from the script. Had I been in his position, I would have boycotted the damn thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I alone in thinking that Tom Hanks is not a great actor? He is just not convincing in this role and is made to look very ordinary when compared to the performances of the supporting players whose role in this film has been unfairly ignored. It is a sad day when Ted Danson makes a more convincing Army Captain than Mr Hanks.This is a good movie but it is not a classic. The battle scenes probably are the most realistic ever filmed but once they are over you are left with a fairly standard war movie with nothing new to say. Sure war is hell but if you have watched any war movie made since Apocalypse Now then surely you know that already. The view of war from the perspective of the common soldier has been done many times before, and in my mind much better in films such as Das Boot, Stalingrad and restoration. I hope that those who are so impressed with Saving Private Ryan take time to check out these films. I would also like to say that as a Brit I did not find the so called nationalistic tone of the film offensive. I don't think that it is an accident that the American Flags are shown to be pale and washed out. I think that this simple image is an effective way of showing a pride in the American achievements in WWII whilst appreciating the tragic loss of life and perhaps an acknowledgement that atrocities were not just the preserve of the Germans. What I did find offensive was the insulting bookend sections which sledge-hammered the message home. Perhaps if Mr Spielberg reads the negative comments about these sections in the IMDB he might realise that we film goers have more intelligence than he gives us credit for and will stop using such unnecessary sentimental devices in his films. In general this film felt like a roller coaster where the biggest drop is the first one. It's exhilerating as hell at the beginning but then you never quite reach the same hights again and end up coasting to a disappointing end.</fullReview>

Probably not, but it's poorly directed and ambiguous. And regardless of the absurdly jingoistic sentiments of some of my fellow countrymen here (which are not worth responding to), the US flag at the end was tacky and implied American superiority. Even my great-uncle, a proud WWII veteran, agreed that this was unnecessary. Spielberg may have meant to shown the true hell that war is, but he has inadvertently made a pro-war film. American entry in WWII was inevitable and necessary, but it's nothing to celebrate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious, as a time and a place where (mostly good-looking) young men can prove how brave they are. SPR would be different, so I expected. In this movie Spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific, not heroic.The first half hour of the movie really was shattering. People who still believe war is an exciting event for young would-be heroes (think: Tom Cruise in Top Gun) should be obligated to watch the Omaha Beach landing-scenes. Because it really makes you experience that war is hell, a sickening, horrible hell.Of course you can't fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the Omaha Beach landing. To make a good movie, you need more, like good actors, a capable crew, convincing special effects and, the most important, an interesting story. Well, no one will dispute the fact that SPR technically is a masterpiece. The camerawork, the special effects, the sound, they are all overwhelmingly good.In spite of all these plusses, I really was disappointed by at least two hours of SPR. Because it missed the most important thing a movie needs: an interesting story! The characters weren't convincing. I don't blame the actors for that, they all did a good job. It was the script that I blame, I never forgot I was watching a movie with made-up characters. When a movie is really good, I tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me, that I start to symphatize deeply with them. This never happened while I was watching SPR. I never felt anything more for Captain Miller and his men then I felt for all the other, anonymous soldiers you see in this movie. And the story, the search for Private Ryan, even bored me sometimes. There were just a few scenes, like the one in which the men were reading the name-tags of the fallen soldiers, that were really compelling.Three things about SPR I really disliked. First there is the way the German soldier known as "Steamboat Willie" was portrayed. Why is the only German we got to know a little bit such an awkward, silly guy? I'm pretty sure lots of German soldiers were ordinary men who didn't want this war any more then anyone else did. They must have been just as afraid as the American soldiers, they must have felt the same pain and horror. But that's not the way it feels like in SPR. The overall feeling you get is "Americans are good" and "Germans are bad". Second, there is the fight for the bridge. This kind of stuff, the brave heroes who, against all odds, succeed in defeating the enemy, well, this has been done so many times before. This kind of cliché was exactly what I expected SPR to avoid. Third, there is the 'point of view'. You are made to believe that the Omaha Beach-scenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard. Then, in the last scene, you learn that that man never was there. I felt manipulated in a negative way!It was very hard for me to grade SPR. Technically, it's an absolute 10. The Omaha Beach-scene was extremely good, and I think it's a real homage to the veterans who were there. But there were too many things I did not like. I decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempt to more political correctness, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, the success of this movie in terms of awards and nominations stems from the cliches of the "let's make everyone aware of the horror of the war", etc. Although this may be a very altruistic objective, it does not imply that the movie has a good story or that the script is artistic or even clever.The story line would have been more suitable for a TV show like Combat or MASH rather than for a full-blown three-hour movie. It seems that the whole objective of the movie was to depict with extreme realism the Omaha Beach situation and to do so the movie makers had to find some movie plot, regardless of what it might be. In fact, despite of the absolutely incredible vividness of Omaha Beach, I started to get really bored - Mr Spielberg seemed to exploit that ad infinitum. Same could be said of the bridge battle.Following the same political correctness track, the way that Germans are depicted is unfair, at least. There was a clear intention in the movie to show the soldiers are traitors and sanguinary (e.g., the knife scene), where the Americans where all nice and warm (e.g., the kid, who was a translator, full of love and care).Overall, I was quite disappointed by this movie. After watching it, it really made me wonder on what basis Globe/Academy awards are given - may be on the "technical" quality of the movie and their PC bent but certainly not on the grounds of its cleverly designed script and plot.This movie falls miles behind other realistic movies about the war such as Apocalypse Now.</fullReview>

As it is, the film meanders hopelessly, unable to decide whether to take itself seriously. It's a shame, since Hanks can act better than here directed, and Spielberg showed in Schindler's List that he can handle a serious theme, with telling economy. For me the truly bathetic scene was when the band of motley misfits decides to do a John Wayne and kill as many Germans as possible. This erodes the impact of the opening scene.</fullReview>

However, the script leaves something to be desired. The characters are cardboard cutouts (you know a character is when you can describe him in a few words) and the fact that the theme is practically drilled into our skulls by the book-ending modern day sequences should be insulting to the intelligence of every audience member watching.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan opens amidst the flurry of panic and madness of Omaha Beach. The US troops trying to make it past the shore and up to the elevations of the enemy, who fire machine guns at the defenceless troops whilst sitting behind fortifications. It's a graphic, powerful, stirring and extremely violent 25 minutes. An unrelenting barrage of gunsmoke, blood and gore. It captures the futility of war through it's no holds barred methods.Tom Hanks plays Captain John Miller, assigned to find a missing private, by the name of Ryan, whose three brothers had recently been killed. He takes a team with him to find Ryan, and along the way runs into a lot of trouble.Unfortunately, the film trails off into the American patriotism rigmarole that seems rudimentary in each war film. Saving Private Ryan becomes boring in the middle of the movie, with contrived, blatant 'war is so pointless' and 'this shouldn't be happening' sort of thing.The finale is very violent and doesn't have as much impact as the opening sequence. The film loses it's impact due to the overlong middle.Seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's begin with the "in your face" gore. Guts on film don't bother me and I'm sure it was historically accurate. But as a movie, it played out like a predictable horror film after the first few heart-pumping minutes. Who didn't see it coming from a mile away when a guy Tom Hanks is dragging gets blown in half? Pure shock value, not story value.Also, the film doesn't look good. From scene to scene we endure a barrage of styles--everything from choppy POV (whose?) to grand panoramics. I assume the drastic changes in cinematography are meant to represent character experience, but I found them a major distraction to becoming absorbed in the film.Characters are poorly defined and even stereotypical: the hothead who doesn't want to follow orders, the 98 lb. weakling who's never shot a gun. We've never seen those before! The only thing that really surprised me was that he didn't find his "inner strength" by the end.The modern-day bookends were quite bothersome as well. This device rarely works because it does nothing more than hinder the audience from being in the moment. I also had a VERY hard time empathizing with the character who appears in those scenes (I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it). We're not given a reason to believe he would feel so strongly later in life, so I simply couldn't share in his drama.There were certainly some great moments in the film, especially in the final battle sequence--the stabbing death of one of the soldiers, and another shooting at a tank with his pistol in desperation. Overall though, the film just didn't flow and I wasn't drawn in.I think audiences are confusing what they think was a shockingly realistic war movie with what was actually just plain shocking for a Spielberg movie. For a good war movie, I'll take Platoon anyday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had quite a few laughs during the movie. It could have been tears too. Especially at the end where Spielberg shows his nationalistic view to comfort his compatriots. At times I couldn't look at the screen anymore (and not because of the bloody scenes). When Tom Hanks says his last words: 'Make sure you're worth it' only the nice lady next to me prevented me from stepping out of the theater. In my opinion, the movie shows the sentimental stuff that is typical of so many American made commercial movies. It was so ridiculous. The Germans outnumbered the enemy but even after 4 years of fierce combat training they weren't able to conquer a piece of land defended by a dozen marines. Instead, they fell like dominoes.If you didn't like it either for the same reasons, try watching Stalingrad (1993) directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. No false sentiment in that one.What I quite liked about SPR were the landings on the beach. (And the Germans actually speak German for a change!) Try watching 'D-Day to Berlin' by George Stevens. Filmed during 1944 -45 and in full colour. Not easy to get your hands on but very impressive!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot said about this film and most of it is completely justified. Steven Speilberg has made a new milestone in the portrayal of the horrors of war. The opening combat scene is probably the most graphic and moving battle scene ever with the final climactic skirmish taking second place. The film also contains some excellent character work which works so well in war films.However there were a few things for me that stopped this film short of being the best war film. Firstly was the blatant Americaness of the film; there was little or no reference to the Canadian and British troops that took part in the invasion. Also being British I find all the stars-and-stripes patriotism very cliched and tiresome.The biggest let-down I think was in private Ryan himself. Unlike the majority of the people in the film he seemed to be completely devoid of believable character. I found it disappointing to wait most of the film to see him and find that he had been plucked almost straight from the filmmaker's A-Z of likeable 20-year-olds.Still, the film was excellent. Hanks and Sizemore pulled off their parts brilliantly and the film had me and all my friends genuinely moved. I think that Schinder's List is still Speilberg's best so far though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a silly movie. Spielberg should stick to special effects for fantasy movies. His one foray into real life drama that worked, Schindlers List, was fine, but this is too much. It is full of holes (what was the point of confronting the first Ryan, who was not THE Ryan), it indulges in highly improbable events to prop up the frail and flimsy script (coming across the REAL Ryan by accident in a fight with a German half track!!!)and resorts to American false heroics to find somewhere to stop the fighting (American fighters blast the German tank as it is about to shoot our hero). This movie takes a noble message, reinforces it with stunning special effects, then shoves it in a vacuous and pretentious story that simply falls over. And the cast don't cut it. War is hell. So is this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me start with this comment, Ryan is not the greatest war film ever made.Not even close.It is however a very moving and affronting action film.It is a great homage to all those older world war 2 films and to other war films of different conflicts.I say action film because it makes no attempt to explain war or focus on issues other than to shock us with its brutality in the opening 20 minutes..that is what jarred me..the first twenty minutes represented what the film should have been...The middle section were what it was..a sentimental cliched journey through old war pictures...sure it was the goriest but Hamburger hill,platoon and dear America:letters home from Vietnam take the cake for the best accounts of war and social,poltical atttudes towards it.Also watch deer hunter for a powerful look at the effect of war on the common soldier..the only thing that saved ryan from being an average film for me was the excellent performances and the handling of the jeremy davies character..who thankfully was saved fro ma cliched ending.apart from that..this poorly written,sloppily(in parts,like hanks giving a tearful speech when his men gather behind him scene)directed yet wonderfully shot(as always by januz kaminiski)film was little more than a sentiemental entertaining romp through old war films. discounting the brutal opening scenes. p.s..can't wait to see how mallick handles it in the thin red line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a powerful 25 minute opening sequence defines a great movie then I guess that this is one. Unfortunately I was always under the impression that plot was also important as is some sort of realism in the plot line. Or did they really just disregard orders during the war and ramble around doing the "right thing" after some democratically resolved squad level rebellion. By the way where were all the other nations soldiers. I know they landed at different beaches but I could have sworn it wasn't just the US that landed in Normandy.The typically Spielberg beginning and ending did nothing for me except to invoke the feeling of "here we go again".The movie is watchable, has some strong action footage, but in my opinion is not Oscar material. I suspect however that the red white &amp; blue smaltz sequences will win over the American voters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, this is THE best war movie ever made, and everyone should see it because for younger generations, it's the closest we'll ever get to understanding that war! However, Saving Private Ryan has the dumbest plot I've ever seen, and that takes a lot away from the movie. It's really unfortunate that a director of Spielberg's undeniable talent would waste such a powerful film by using such a stupid story line. The fact that so many soldiers had to die -- not only that, but one of the best generals (Tom Hanks) was taken from the battlefield where his services would have been much more important -- in order to find one man. I would not be surprised to see this movie sweep the Oscars, but based on the weakness of the screenplay alone, this movie should never get the honor of Best Picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment SPR was announced, I had a feeling that it was mostly hype and little substance. This feeling was confirmed after the first battle scene.No one doubts the technical brilliance of Spielberg. A movie, however, needs more than special effects to be memorable.War movies like "Platoon" and "Apocalypse" have it all and I suspect will better stand the test of time.What I feel that SPR failed to achieve is to sustain the dramatic impact. Between war scenes, we were subjected to all manner of light hearted banter, irony, coincidence and schmaltz. (but then again, this is a Spielberg trademark - he also did it in Schindlers List.).The plot was highly predictable hence there was little suspense. One became immune to watching the blood and guts after the first hour. By this time the film had nothing more to offer.A fellow contributor wrote:"To those who thought the film didn't have a good plot - what film school did you say you went to?"Well, it didn't have a good plot and I didn't go to any film school, but I know what I like...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically brilliant, but disappointing all the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt in my mind that 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically one of the best films ever. Janusz Kaminski should be congratulated for his cinematography, especially in the opening sequence. The sound effects are amazing, and I for one was particularly impressed by the part where the sound of raindrops on leaves imitated the sound of guns firing.It's no understatement to say that Tom Hanks is brilliant. He has proven himself to be the most versatile actor in Hollywood, without exception. If the hype is true that 'Saving Private Ryan' is up against 'The Truman Show' to sweep the Oscars, and Hanks is up against Jim Carrey for Best Actor, then 'Ryan' and Hanks should win hands down.Yet all the same I felt severely disappointed, maybe even cheated, by the movie. Beneath the main plot, a sort of sub-plot developed in which the audience is given glimpses into the internal emotions and mental turmoil of all involved, especially Captain Miller. At least, that's what I perceived the shaking hand and the "I'm a schoolteacher" bit to mean. The audience is sucked into thinking that, regardless of how many die, and whether or not Ryan is saved, this sub-plot is going to lead to Spielberg's big thematic message, his conclusion, his comment, at the end. But that resolution never comes, and there seems to be no point to the film, nothing it's trying to say. While that in itself is not disappointing, as many films have no message, what is frustrating is being led to feel as though a lesson is coming, and then not getting it.In terms of the violence, I don't think the Omaha beach landing sequence is particularly gruesome, at least no more graphic than the part in the middle where Miller's men apply pressure to a stomach wound, and you feel the victim suffering as he turns white and dies.And, not being an American but an Australian, there has been a lot made of the so-called Americanism of the film, how no black American soldiers seem to be mentioned, and how the other Allied troops are forgotten about, but I tend to think that's no more than pedanticism, taking a stereotypical swipe at a film where such bias has no glaring impact.So in short, 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically brilliant, but it still left a very hollow feeling. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Heights Achieved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a terrific cinematic achievement. It's a great combat film, very violent and often relentless, with battle scenes that lift the genre to new heights. Saving Private Ryan is a classic shoot 'em up film, or should that be shoot 'em off film, one that will always be compared favourably, at least in terms of the fight scenes, to other modern American battle movies like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.A squad of American infantrymen lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), having somehow survived the carnage of the D day landing on Omaha Beach in Northern France, are given the task of finding Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who's three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles. The Army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brother.The squad have reservations about this mission, feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich, but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war. These men are battle hardened except for their translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who has yet to fire a gun in anger. Along the way two are killed, raising the stakes considerably. Private Ryan, when and if they find him, had better be worth it.Saving Private Ryan is striking on a number of fronts. Overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops, even before they hit the beach. And that's only the beginning. Throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive. Limbs and intestines are lost and maimed. The horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphically.Lots of new cinematic ground is broken. For a start the slaughter by Americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable, or at least understandable in this film. I can't remember American soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before, not like they do in Saving Private Ryan. I can see now that the viciousness of the situation, the deaths of comrades, makes a mockery of The Geneva Convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field. These things aren't right of course, but they are understandable.As such it's salient that this was a Second World War battle movie. It's hard to imagine this sort of film being made about American soldiers in Vietnam or Iraq for example. It's still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in Europe in response to the invasion of the rest of Europe by Hitler's army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the U.S.A.'s more recent invasions.Steven Speilberg, the director of Saving Private Ryan, is steeped in the traditions of Hollywood and wasn't slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films. The multi-ethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad. The wise cracking Brooklynite (Edward Burns), the Jewish American (Adam Goldberg) the solid middle American Sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and the sharp shooting, (and unfortunately bible quoting) Southern boy (Barry Pepper) are hauled out yet again.Often war films are coming of age movies but Jeremy Davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in Saving Private Ryan who develops and grows, the rest are already established as warriors. Tom Hanks plays the Captain very effectively indeed, with a great deal of restraint, and I would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another Academy Award.The American Flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in Saving Private Ryan, which is a tad trying for some non Americans, but again this seems irrelevant because Saving Private Ryan is essentially a battle movie, and an exciting one. But of course, the only traitorous individual in sight is a German.Perhaps it's a mistake to expect too much subtlety from Speilberg anyway. Steven Speilberg strengths lie with the visual. He's uncomfortable with character development, conversation and the variance of personalities. Schindler's List, another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with Saving Private Ryan, was devastating for its audience, but that was because of the slaughter, the heartlessness, of the huge massacre that was the holocaust. It was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvas.The same can be said of Saving Private Ryan. We care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them. This is Spielberg's triumph in Saving Private Ryan and also its weakness. If Spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether Private Ryan was saved of not, then Saving Private Ryan would have been even more magnificent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a good film but from the appearance of the film you would think that Europe is full of Americans since they landed on D-Day themselves and meet a few French folk and some German soldiers and POWs. The film is far too patriotic with the American flag at the start and the end, with Spielbergs family coming from POW camps during the second World War camps I though he might of had a less US view of WWII. It could have been one of the best films ever made but after the start with the horrific beach landings it never achieved those heights again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 minutes of cinema, 2 hours of American-patriotic-mambo-jambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 20 first minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" are among the one of the most dazzling sequences in the history of motion picture. I`ve remembered particularly Sergei Eisentein`s "Potemkin" - perhaps because of the hand-held shaken camera, or because of the reality of the scenes. But... ...unfortunately, Spielberg hasn`t got to - or hasn`t wished to - develop the madness of the war in his movie. The mis-organization of the operations could have been deeply developed. The consequences of the "star wars" between Patton and Montgomery could have been shown implicating both for part of the useless death of thousands of young men. And the disorientation itself of the soldiers could have been better exploited.Also, an annoying series of cliches runs during all the movie. The soldier that has feelings and gets killed because of them; the coward changed to a hero in the end of the battle; the guy-to-be-saved-that-should-be-a-moron-but-it`s-not; the arrival of the "cavalry" in the very last moment; and, last but not least, the "America brings back home their children" motto. Disgusting.It`s also annoying to see - or, better speaking, NOT to see - the participation of the French resistance, that gave valious information to the allies and fought the Nazis from inside, with their guerrilla tactics. But who cares? According to Spielberg, the Americans would have won anyway.Finally, this is the third movie that is released by the director in the 1,85:1 aspect ratio. Probably to be better adapted for the DVD technology coming soon. The screen ends being too small for a movie like this.If "Saving Private Ryan" was meant to be an anti-war film, it has falled kilometers from this objective. "Apocalypse Now" is far more efficient this way. Spielberg is yet to release a great movie after "Schindler`s List".</fullReview>

If the intention is to show the pointlessness of war then the story should be absurd - not just stupid. Read Catch 22.Spielberg is good, some parts of the movie are great but that doesn't help. The melodrama is still there. People tell me that SPR is an anti-war film. I don't agree The battle scenes are really repulsive - but - an eternal glory is still offered to the brave American heroes. And the Germans prove to be bad guys - all of them.I think that SPR is worth seeing for a few amazing battle-scenes, Spielberg's ability to tell stories in pictures rather than words and for its very good sound. Not for much else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but a first viewing leaves me feeling "totally overrated non-movie." I didn't like the on-screen format (too low aspect ratio, the *size* of Omaha and Normandy were not there), the initial scenes, which were supposed to be so stark, all this preview "hype" about veterans freaking out, well I'm sorry if they did, but I didn't see how. Spielberg's psychology was so easy to see, already in the initial moments. Instead of hitting you with a big build up as is done in ordinary scare movies, he just hits you when you're least expecting it - and knowing that, you can read the "surprises" and the horrors that he's supposed to deliver like an open book. So much for realism.Nor was there much "vastness" to the D-Day assault. Memories of Ryan's book on screen were much more convincing from that viewpoint at least. Omaha was a terrible disaster - and vast as well, and three Allied boats on screen do not really do the trick.Hanks was excellent, of course, they all were, Sizemore, Damon, who couldn't be drawn into the story, but watching the aftermath a la Schlindler - no, I do not find this kind of story-telling convincing.Several critics have hailed this movie as Spielberg's best ever, I find it hard to agree - although I wouldn't know which movie to pick in its place - as I do not think Spielberg is a real auteur by any stretch of the imagination, or ever could be. He is imminently successful, but his is the "big shot", the opposite of Ingemar Bergman, who says, "kill your darlings." He can film, he can see the "shot", but he cannot create. Harsh words, and perhaps a bit overdone, but it seems accurate at this moment.Which is not to say I did not enjoy the movie. Of course I did. It was an excellent movie. Well told, accurate depictions for the most part, astounding acting all around - it just wasn't the "Saving Private Ryan" it was cracked up to be. Its reputation bloated it all out of proportion. It is not Spielberg's best movie (though it may be close), it is not - I firmly believe right now - an Academy Award winner either. Which is a shame for Tom Hanks, who has worked so hard, and been such a convincing actor through so many memorable performances. Perhaps his time - his third Oscar - will yet come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan wasn't really up to its reputation. The movie did have its moments and merits but sadly most of those merits were on the technical side. The effects and the set-ups were great, but that does not tell much of the movie itself... except that a lot of money was burned while doing it. So most of the things that money could buy were done beautifully but the movie didn't really have too much to offer on the other areas.I left the theatre wondering what on earth were they trying to tell/say to me with that movie. The first half hour of the movie was good enough to stand on its feet, showing the madness of the war. But after that the movie started to stall. There was a lot of useless and over-long scenes that didn't really add anything to the movie. Except maybe a little frustration for the viewer. Length is not a bad thing for a movie, as long as the creators have something to say or to show. In Saving Private Ryan, there seemed not to be.Technically beautiful, very violent (okay, it's a war movie so maybe it is acceptable) and rather empty movie. I just hope that it is not becoming a habit of praising these overlong drama-movies where a fictional story is placed into a historical context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why the press loves that starting scene of the landing of the allied in the Normandy. The first person camera was shaking so much that I was quite literally thrown out of the scene and this just went on when Miller and his team engaged this german APC or whatever on a green field with flowers. That said, let's continue. The good things about the movie were: The story idea made it possible to blank out any strategical or tactical aspects of war, which either divert the watcher or justifies war itself (lost bla, but saved blabla) ... at least up to a certain point (the value of that bridge was only outlined with "the one of two remaining intact ones..."). The movie features also very moving graphical effects, by that I mean wounds, lost body parts, outflowing intestines. And also audio effects like the noise of the tanks in the beginning of the German attack on that bridge. I hope you know what I mean. Some nice ideas like the rain drops splashing onto the leaves, making you think that it's like the sound of gunfire, which turns out to be true afterwards. And others which were tragi-comical (soldier takes off his helmet after it luckily deflected a bullet and is promptly...)But. I don't like the movie. Actually, I hate Spielberg for this "goddamn" movie, pardon the term. The very scene, I mean, is when a German and an American soldier fight (attack on bridge) on the first level of one of the houses and the German pulls out his knife and happens to be on top of his "enemy". And what then happens must be told in full, as I remember it. The silent whimpering of the soldier as the blade cuts slowly through the fabric of his jacket and then on and on and on and all the time the German whispers: "Give up, you don't have a chance, it well be easier for you, give up, it be will easier .... Shhh shhh". Until the blade has fully made its way through chest and heart and the soldier is dead. No bursting out "you goddamn nazi, I never give up", no "ha, ruthless defender of so-called democracy, receive your true punishment" or whatever. No, two people forced to kill each other and only one can win. THIS scene is still in my mind, all the time and I do hope that it will fade somewhen. But let's cut out that personal stuff of mine ... The movie was great in a way. When those tanks are coming, the little hill behind which the Americans take cover sliding down by the trembling of the ground. Captain Miller pulling a soldier after him at the landing, whose legs are blown away and Miller does not realise it. You really went out of it and were stunned. BUT: The beginning is the weak point in my opinion, the stunning phase happens in the end.Now on to my general concerns (last paragraph, I swear). I think, war is "bad". The "stupid" thing about war is that it involves humans and especially the killing of humans. Further on, war is even stranger. Humans kill without any inner motivation, without real hate or anger out of personal reasons (although sister was killed by Germans V2 in London ...). It is so abstract and so unreal. One of the other commenters said, that Full Metal Jacket would score better in showing the futility of war. And that's the point ! Futility, desparation, hopelessness, the lacking of sense and reason ... that is war for me. Concerning humans, there is not a single good thing about war. Lives are simply thrown away, dumped, cannon-fodder.Open bodies, blown away extremities or injuries like that don't touch me but things like "soldier A nearly makes it to blabla but just before he reaches it, he's shot" (remember "A bridge too far" when the solider runs for that cylindric box hoping to find ammunition or whatever and there are only hats inside ?) This is war for me. I think, "Platoon" is better. I think, "A bridge too far" is better. I think, "The Bridge" is better. Actually, although all the anti-war-movies I know are inferior in terms of visuals and sound, they all are superior to "Saving Private Ryan". The only thing speaking well for all of you is, that good visuals and sounds directly influence unconsciousness...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with SPR...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, this is an awe-inspiring masterpiece of discomfort. Spielberg has succeeded where Stone failed with NATURAL BORN KILLERS - he has made a movie which genuinely affects its audience and serves as an indictment of the cinematic tradition of defying the violent and the warlike, without running the risk of inculcating a cult of violence as cool among the impressionable and the stupid.SPR moved me to tears within about ten minutes of the opening credits. Wonderful performances from Tom Hanks (a little saccharine actually), Tom Sizemore and - especially - young Giovanni Ribisi.As in SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg's camera is uncompromising in its gaze, presenting horrific acts of violence and tragedy unblinkingly and without fanfare. Where the earlier film occasionally strayed into manipulative heart-string plucking, however, SPR treads a fine line bordering on hero-worship. To draw comparison with Oliver Stone again, SPR lacks the sense of futility, helplessness and desperation of FULL METAL JACKET.But then it is a far more didactic enterprise than was JACKET. And in its full-on, vitriolic condemnation of capital-W War,it succeeds admirably. Nausea, tears, exhaustion are all common amongst people leaving a screening. Blase attitudes and take-it-or-leave-it shrugs are not.Certainly a film which should be seen and pondered upon at length. There is, however, something wrong with Saving Private Ryan....D-Day 1944, right? Loads of Allied troops dying their way up the beaches of Normandy, right? Mission in the thick of the front line in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, right?So... WHY DO WE ONLY SEE AMERICANS AND GERMANS? Where are the British soldiers? Where are the Poles, the Czechs, the Dutch? What about the Australians, the Canadians, the Russians? We see a family of three French refugees, but can that really be it? Spielberg seems to be trying to depict WWII as Vietnam but with less greenery and no dope.Contrary to this film's thesis, WWII was not a war of attrition between the US and the Third Reich. The whole world was involved - hence the first W in WWII. You have to get used to Americocentric conceit in Hollywood movies, but this is one opportunity to present an accurate and unbiased account of the War that has been horribly missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the best film I've ever seen, a film which give me so much thoughts and feelings. Although the film is a little bit too cruel and fleshly, it is a good media to let people think about the reality of a war, a campaign that can ruin millions of lives and souls. The most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed, but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet. Think of it, they are flesh and blood, not the characters in the TV games. Should they be killed just for one or two people's foolish decision? They all have families, they are innocent. I appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal, to save private Ryan and send him home at any cost, he didn't mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fields.Steven Spielburg has produced a very great movie, different from the other scientific film he had ever made, but it is a most touching film that gives a good lesson to most of the people.

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan makes sures that machine guns will still be rattling in your head, even after you leave the cinema. The movie, set in the dying moments of the Second World War, explores the brutal truths of war. Limbs fly and blood splatter with historical accuracy as Steven Spielberg takes an unflinching look at D-Day. This film wins the heart of many by exposing them to the terrors of war. With the help of computer generated effects, the madness of the warfront is brought to our world. Knocks across the idea that war is senseless and should be avoided at all costs. This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made, with its superb plot, stunning effects and documentary-style camera angles. Move over Titanic, Saving Private Ryan IS the iceberg that is going to sink you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie extremely well done with a lot of money and great historical background but c'mon... this movie doesn't deserve all the fuzz it's been getting. The plot is silly and the characters are flat (just like all Spielberg movies). They are completely good or completely evil! Think about Tom Hanks' character: he simply doesn't exist! Now compare all Spielberg's movies with Scorcese's movies. Wow, now you see the difference... DeNiro could never play the captain because he wouldn't HAVE a character. Although I think Tom Hanks is really great. This movie is just like Amistad. The good and the evil... and the emptiness...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like several of the viewers whose comments appear here, I was expecting great things because of all the hype, but was rather disappointed by the film when I actually saw it. True, the opening and closing half hours are very violent, with no holds barred in showing us the horrors of war (but let's face it - is there anyone out there who doesn't realize that war is horrible?)I think one of the main problems I had with the film was that is was yet another of those nauseating "America won the war single-handed" type films (there were no references that I spotted to any other nation's contribution to the D-day landing). I also found the story line rather weak - the idea that a team of men would be dispatched to find one soldier just because his brothers had been killed is hard to swallow. Tragedies such as that must have occurred many times in WW2, and I can't imagine the military would go to those lengths every time it happened.The script is also rather weak - for most of the middle part of the film, very little happens, and the scenes where the soldiers try to give deep philosophical insight into their feelings about the war just didn't grab me.Sorry, but it's only a 5 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it's a good film. Thought provoking and horrifying, gory and traumatic... but it's not a GREAT film. Why not? Simply because it tries too hard to do too many things and ends up as neither one thing nor the other. Is it a hard-hitting attempt to reveal the bloody futility of war, or is it a "shoot 'em up" Hollywood blockbuster action movie with an unbelieveable plot and overly realistic gore and special effects?In my very humble opinion it fails as soon as Private Ryan is found. Up to that point all of the horrors of war are exposed for our wretched "entertainment". The senseless (but inevitable) waste of human life, the vile slaughter in the sea and on the beaches, man's inhumanity to man etc, etc...and then all of a sudden it's hello to "Kelley's Heroes II". A handful of battle-weary men thrown together in dire cicumstances, "spitwad" weapons, a few smelly socks and a tub of axle grease, up against 4 tanks, a 120mm gun and 50+ German infantrymen. Well don't we just know who's going to win that one right from the start? And as for the airborne "tank-buster" cavalry arriving just in time??? Please!Two thirds of the way through, this "potentially Great" movie sold out and died.One more point, the Stars and Stripes flag at the beginning and end is jingoistic, patronising and insensitive to all the other nations who were involved in the Normandy landings. Men from all over the "allied" world died on those beaches. Contrary to popular belief, the world does not begin and end at the borders of the United States of America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad I saw this movie and some elements in it tend to justify my anti -war attitudes, but it is NOT one of the greatest movies of all time. It might not even be one of the greatest Steven Spielburg movies. Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park are definitely better, and Spielberg has made several movies that MIGHT be better like Jaws, Amistad, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and maybe more.Saving Private Ryan is a good movie with some good qualities, and some bad ones. After how great I had heard SPR was, when I saw it, I was disappointed in the directing, writing and acting. I expected all of those things to be great and found the directing to be pretty good, the writing to be pretty bad and the acting to be mediocre. I'm sorry, but graphic war action which makes us think long and hard about many things is not enough reason for me to love this movie as much as so many other people seem to. And the emotional nature of 3 brothers getting killed in action and the attempt to bring the last brother home to his mom doesn't cut it either. Because quite frankly that's pretty much all this movie was about. It was a good movie, but that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as a British man and European I could not help but feel insulted by the general jingoistic attitude. Where were the other allies, the British, Canadians, Australians, French, Poles etc.? America did not win the war on their own and a bit of recognition for the brave men of EVERY country that died would not have gone amiss. Having the stars and stripes as the opening and ending shot was little more than insulting to these men. Similarly, why were the Germans portrayed as deserving cannon fodder? They were humans too, men fighting for the lives of their friends and family. Why couldn't we see that? Surely the true horror of war is that on both sides we are the same simple men. That aside, it's a fantastic film, despite having a weak plot and stereotyped one-dimensional characters and is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awhile back a group of us decided that we wanted to experience what combat could of been like. The closest thing we could use for that experence was a game called "paintball", We played the game for over 2 years. I won't go into a lot of detail about the game other than when you get shot it hurts, sometimes it hurts a lot, those of you who have played know what I mean. It hurts enough that it makes you go to great extents while you're playing to not get shot. This in turn generates alot of emotions, fear, anger, cowardness, joy these are a few that come to mind. I want to expand on the fear, I've felt my stomach twist into knots as a group of guys bear down on my particular position in a game. I've felt scared knowing that what's about to happen is going to hurt, maybe alot. Probably only a few readers will have any idea of what I'm talking about, but the point is I always got up and went home. That's what this movie is about, those that didn't get up and go home. I get down on my knees and bow to all of the combat veterans that died and those who survived for I had no idea what you went through until this movie, thank you. For those of you who have to grind an axe on this site with Spielberg, Hanks, or who ever leave it in the closet. The movie isn't about personalities or politics it's about war!

		<shortDescription>The best and most realistic war movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War movies have, in the past, tended to lean toward patriotic flag waving or antiwar sentiments. There have been a few notable exceptions, such as "Hell Is For Heroes" and "Castle Keep". These movies shine through because they depicted the action relatively realistically. "Saving Private Ryan" is another movie that thrusts the viewer into the confusion and carnage. The action scenes were extremely realistic. If it had tried more to show some of the routine hardships of a combat soldier, such as fatigue, cold, hunger, etc., then I think this masterpiece of a movie would have been even better. Even so, I rate this as the top movie of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no "saving" this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew going in and it being Spielberg that there wasn't going to be much variety, but wow there is almost none. Most of the movie is focused around of course "saving" Private Ryan. And yet it almost feels like the movie is more about how much Spielberg is at his old tricks. Most of the characters are one dimensional and hardly get any development other than Tom Hanks who is as always golden. The worst of them though is Matt Damon (he's Pvt. Ryan). He's stereotypically arrogant and seems like the type of guy who's all talk and no walk. It makes him pretty much impossible to like and leaves you with the desire to shut off the movie once he's on the screen. As for the story, what story? Most of what should be story is hampered by more arguing and attempts at comedic, more lighthearted moments. In the middle of war? Really? And the film being nearly 3 hours feels so padded and stretched out that it's like watching a 90 minute movie in slow motion. So if you want my advice, skip this and rent Full Metal Jacket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful and dated vs. great acting and characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie years ago on German television and later in English on DVD and my perception of it changed quite a bid. When I first watched it I was in a phase of looking for moral and bright heroes in movies. This movie has none and it utterly disgusted me. When I watched it again I saw something completely different. I give this movie a rating which is far off from the majority but there are quite a few reasons for it: 1. This is a war movie which wants to show the brutality and maybe(?) senselessness of war in an authentic way. The beginning scene is pretty good at that and is rightfully one of the most famous movie scenes of all times. After that the movie completely falls apart. The Germans just become puppets which can't harm the heroes neither from perfect positions nor with 10-1 odds. Its absurd and worse than any 50s war movie I have ever seen. Even John Rambo would laugh about this. I would call it racism but then again Spielberg made Schindler so I guess despite him hating Nazis (And rightfully so) he doesn't hate all Germans. 2. It really feels dated to me because of 1. Since then band of brothers and letters from Iwojima came out which are much better depictions of WWW and would deserve the rating this movie has. Things like the bullet going through the sniper vision are also extreme 90s cheese. 3. On the other hand the acting is still great from many of the actors. Tom Hanks just delivers. He is the cliché of the good man in a bad war being forced to do what he does but he really nails it. As cringeworthy as this cliché is I would say Hanks does it best. Very good. Dialogue is good and characters act believable in the boundaries of the movie. 4. Action is also pretty decent. If you like stuff blowing up its as good as it gets. 5. My main problem I had watching it the first time still holds up. The movie has insane moral values. The German prisoner they don't shoot is betraying his promise later on and gets killed for that. WTF? Its awful but whatever, he is only one of quite a few Germans they didn't have to kill but did. The enemy in this movie are really not treated like humans. This really is a weakness of the movie but I think most movie viewers don't even recognize that and that is a problem. Letters from Iwojima is so much better. Final thoughts: It really is the Fury of the 1990s but much better acted, with better dialogue and embarrassingly(for Fury) better effects. I still miss more modern stuff like portraying the enemy as humans and the vulnerability of everyone in the war. Ryan only has that in the beach scene although the Germans have no face their either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>greatest war movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed most of Spielbergs movies like E.T, goonies, the mind blowing Jurassic park and of course saving private Ryan. Never has a movie stirred such emotions in me of sadness and awe. From the moment the movie begins, so does the true horror of war itself. I've never been to war but this movie, I believe had given me a good idea of what a soldier in action goes through. The first 45 minutes left me feeling horrified and sick and so did the scene where the runner gets shot down then finished off in a barrage of bullets. It is a bloodthirsty flick but war is hell and this movie captures that. Tom Hanks performance is by far his best as an officer who suffers from a form of shell shock and as his job requires, has to hide his emotions from his troops even though the loss of his men to save 1 whose brothers have all fallen in the heat of battle cannot be justified. The finally also is horrific and Spielberg did an amazing job capturing the horror of war. 1 of the best films and cinematic experiences I have ever seen. 10 out of 10 for me. Spielberg is the greatest director of all time. A must see to teach us why we must be reluctant to go to war. War horse also is the best depiction of the great war I've seen too. Another Spielberg great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystified by the bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the bad reviews on here have led me to the conclusion that people feel smarter by trashing critically-acclaimed and Oscar winning films like this one. This is one of, if not the, greatest war movies ever made. The opening 20 minutes is one of the most harrowing battle scenes ever filmed, and in itself debunks the theory that this is a pro-war movie. Anyone who wants to go to war after seeing the opening scene of this film is crazy. This film is poignant and heartbreaking, particularly Vin Diesel and Private Mellish's deaths, and the idea that this film is pro-war in any way is ridiculous. A bunch of reviewers on here criticize the film for only showing the American perspective on D-Day: hate to break it to you guys, but this is a film about a squad of American soldiers who go on a mission to find an American paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in combat. Putting another country's perspective in this film would have been ridiculous and wouldn't have fit in with the rest of the film. As for the other arguments against the film, which are basically a bunch of nit picky details like the type of rifle they are carrying or an insignia on someone's uniform or some other ridiculous historical detail that really has no effect on the film at all, this movie never pretends to be a documentary, and shouldn't be taken as one. Some of these people cite The Paths of Glory or The Longest Day as examples of great war films, and don't get me wrong, I loved both movies, but I could write a whole list on their historical inaccuracies. Films like this one should not be analyzed as documentaries, but should be taken for what they are-excellent, well-filmed, well-acted, harrowing, and heartbreaking films that bring the brutality and horror of war into our lives.</fullReview>

One post suggested that the baby boomer generation had to try to prove they were as good as the generations before them. I have no clue what that means. Other post suggest the movie is average once the beach scene is over. This movie is incredible. Every mission, every detail, the thought process of each character, their personalities, makes this movie about as true to life as a movie can get. It is an epic piece of work and kudos to all the actors in this picture that bring this film to life. If the very first and last scenes, not the beach scene or the battle scene in the abandoned town at the end, I mean where the elder Ryan visiting Capt. Miller's grave doesn't drive home what this movie is about then just stick to comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War Movie That Needs To Be Seen By Everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement. What Spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making. This is emotional, unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there. Now is this the most original story ever told? No. The storm of Normandy has been shown before. The story has been told before. (This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most realistic battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there. (Some could not finish watching the scene) So if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie. See this! It centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world. To be clear though, this movie is not just about that war. The story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a man.OK, how about the rest of the movie? The searching and hopefully the rescue of Private Ryan? Excellent! You will be interested and want to know what happens. A great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end. Oh and Mr. Spielberg does a fantastic job in bookending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all together.I original saw this with my dad on it's original release in theaters. After the movie I asked him what he thought. He literally could not speak for like twenty minutes. Watched it again just recently with my girlfriend. Reaction was pretty much the same. Nothing to say for a bit. This movie leaves an impression and does what many a movie does not. You walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie. A small glimpse of our history and US as human beings enduring all the horror, war, laughter, tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on.</fullReview>

George C. Marshall is just too good.I like to share the last lines of that speech. (Gen.George C. Marshall):"I pray that our heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and emotionally draining piece which places the viewer at the forefront of chaos, angst and deliberation in 1944 France.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's anti-thesis to the action movie, indeed the blockbuster ideology. From the man who made his name, indeed inspired a entire movement if you'd like to label the blockbuster so, in making 1975's Jaws; a film that skipped along the boundaries of comedy, horror and sheer action driven spectacle, comes a film that combines the latter two of those three and approaches them from a completely different angle. Whilst Spielberg-helmed; starring functional, friendly, relaxed and 'accessable' lead Tom Hanks; released in the summer month of July in America, but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film, Saving Private Ryan is anything but the usual summertime-Spielberg-Hanks led flick, instead turning a entire 'promise' into a thing of pure terror. In a summer that saw Deep Impact, Armeggeddon and Godzilla released in close proximity, Saving Private Ryan must have been quite the jolt.People have written in the past about the degrees of sentimentality and the nuisance to do with the unreliable narrator. I think it's impossible to look, or even think, back to the times of The Second World War without a sense of sentimentality. The notes that accompany the DVD state that Spielberg attempted to get across that orally guided sense of the father telling the child, ie; his father informing him of the horrors of the war. Such an approach, to some, might sound a little convention, indeed like a cliché, or something that contains a degree of sentimentality. Essentially, this is exactly what Spielberg does in Saving Private Ryan; he doesn't trivialise in rendering it TV movie of the week built around some harsh battle scenes, he delivers on a true-to-life narrative as told through the perspective of someone who wasn't there but is aware of the horrors, much in the way anybody born post WWII might attempt to re-imagine what it must have been like to fight under certain conditions.The film is, in fact, delivered by way of a flashback ? a delving into the past a specific soldier does in order so that we may relive what occurred over the space of half a dozen or so days, echoing Spielberg's own relation to the war stories of old by way of his father. The film is about unity; teamwork and the risk of sacrifice those undertake for individuals they are yet to meet, for the platoon in Saving Private Ryan it is an individual they know is out there but in the grander scale of things, it is for people spanning a number of generations across a number of nations they will certainly never encounter.Following the flashback, Spielberg provides us with a few seconds of calm before the storm in the form of waves lapping up on a beach. The place is northern France, the event is D-Day in 1944. Much has been written about the landings, going into them would only repeat what has been said but it's worth noting that the first lines anybody ever says once all the vomiting and praying in the landing crafts has stopped arrives in the form of a load of military directions and ramblings which the viewer might not properly hear, enhancing confusion and a sense of disorientation just prior to the drawn out sequence of carnage. With this, and as pointed out in a review in a publication, the casting of Hanks as Captain John Miller gives the audience something to map onto amidst the chaos, as actors that do not carry similar weight to Hanks are either blown apart around him or placed in this Hellish cauldron. However, years later the likes of Pepper; Burns and Diesel have since established themselves as names and face thus threatening to dampen the intended purpose of anonymity Spielberg meant. Viewing it recently, I do not feel any of the impact is particularly lost.Their eventual mission to seek out the Private Ryan of the title, a certain Matt Damon, who's located somewhere pretty deep within northern France; deep enough so that the march there will last half a dozen or so days march for the troops. Miller's platoon is made up of the guys that survived with him on the beaches of D-Day plus a certain Private by name of Upham, a trilingual troop played by Jeremy Davies who does his usual scrawny; softly spoken; seemingly untrustworthy and somewhat ill-at-ease-with-everyone-else act which was fresher back then than it is now. Miller's professionalism is only enforced by talk of a highly dangerous, off screen mission he undertook; one that saw him and his crew knock out a number of German anti-air craft guns. Dennis Farina's somewhat impressed and therefore transfixed gaze locks onto a talking Miller, as the emphasis in his character's superiority in military activity is encored. He and his platoon's journey is punctuated by interactions with French families; German snipers; machine gun nests and conflicts with each other as they go in search.To say the film concludes with an almighty shoot-out between two sides in a bombed out and long since deserted French town, would be grossly misleading. In a sense, an action film might very well 'build' to an explosive and dramatic set piece but while Saving Private Ryan might conform to a series of heroic actions, followed by a twist in fate just as a fatal blow is about to be struck to whom we think is the 'lead', the lingering feeling is on the sense of loss more-so spectacle. One might argue the sequence comes across as more stark and more frightening than the opening beach landings simply because of the presence of the reason the platoon are even there; the fear of loss of life comes across as more prominent in a film that has thus far displayed a massive amount of loss. The film is a towering achievement, and one of the better films out of the decade that-was the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best D-Day scene ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan rekindled an interest in the media about the Second World War, with the TV Series Band of Brothers, films ranging from the Great Raid to Enemy at the Gate to Pearl Harbor and computer games like the Medal of Honour and Call of Duty series. Saving Private Ryan is also noted for its use of realistic of violence and war combat, which has continued into further films and television programmes.Set during the early days of the invasion of Europe by the Allied troops, a platoon of American soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned to find Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), an soldier who 3 brothers are killed in action. He has a ticket home. The mission sounds simple enough, but Ryan was in the 101th Airborne and dropped behind enemy lines before D-Day. Miller's Platoon has to go through enemy territory to find one man. The platoon who are assigned with Miller start to question the mission, especially when their men start dying.The war scene, especially the D-Day scene are some of the best committed to film. It shows that war was very brutal, very bloody, confusing and the need for good tactics and good men. The film makes an effort to show a mixed picture, that the Germans were a soldiers, not monsters or all Nazis, whilst some Americans can be arrogant and even committed war crimes, like killing surrendering soldiers. It is so much better compared to a one-dimensional film like Braveheart. Spielberg is a great director, and avoids shooting the film in a ordinary way. He uses a hand-held style, and his cinematographer Janusz Kami&#x144;ski films in a washed out look, giving the film a documentary, gritty feel. He knows how to make a film visually wonderful. They is an excellent cast, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon in leading roles, whilst even small roles were filled by established actors like Ted Danson and Paul Giamatti. Tom Hanks is the most well developed character, making you care about what happens to him and what drives him throughout the film. Many of the characters have backstorys like Private Ryan or character traits like the arrogant Jew or the sniper who was a committed Catholic.There are however problems with this film. The script and story are weak. They are character clichés like the wimp, the ultra good officer who is committed to the mission, the brave soldier, etc.... On the other side of the coin some characters simply disappeared off the screen because you couldn't care about them. The story is also ridiculous; could you really picture the American military risking a whole platoon to save one man, a private, a farm boy from Iowa? Especially with him being in the middle of enemy territory and not knowing where he was, not fighting on the frontline. It's hard to suspend your disbelief. The film is also a normal piece of American Patriotism, showing how great their were. I know it's an American story, but it ignores some of the darker elements which other writers and directors would have focused on, mainly non-American filmmakers. They was no mention of the British or Canadian forces fighting, and even Robert Rodat writes a line which pretty much an attack on Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, a British war hero. Rodat must have some issues with the British because he also wrote the really awful The Patriot. Saving Private Ryan also has the same problem that Gladiator has, that it's opening is so good that nothing else in the film can compare to it.Saving Private Ryan is a example of a director improving on the script he is given. Worth watching, a good Oscar win for Spielberg, but The Thin Red Line should have won Best Picture in 1998, over Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely fantastic film--one of the best of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film grips you from the very beginning and holds you spellbound through the entire movie--it has all the elements of an endearing classic that both informs and entertains. In reading the other reviews it is absolutely amazing that anyone would rate this movie below 7 or 8 stars. It seems the detractors fall generally into two camps--those that do not like the fact that the German soldiers were not shown in the same sympathetic manner as the Americans and those with such virulent anti-American or anti-war sentiments that they are simply incapable of forming an objective, rational, and honest opinion. In other words, their negative reviews of the movie are an expression of their political/ideological views, not their honest assessment of the quality of this movie, which does a disservice to this movie and to those they may dissuade from seeing this film. So don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this movie--it is truly one of the best movies ever made of any genre. If you are a fan of great film making, you will love this movie--if you are virulently anti-war or anti-American, this film is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets a reaction out of me every time I see it(and I'm certain I'm NOT alone)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I cannot speak from any sort of personal experience,not militarily nor age-wise(my late maternal grandfather actually was in the European theater of command during WWII,and missed being involved in D-day by not that much,if I'm to understand correctly),so I would and could not dispense with any of the critiques that I've read here regarding how true or authentic the military/war element of the film was(and there were about equal parts of both those who thought this show was the best/very accurate and those who thought this wasn't even close/completely inaccurate,from what I was able to divine off the long rolls of comments). So I can only review this the way someone in my position can:namely,from how it directly affected me.And for that,this film is completely and totally spot-on.The possibly fictionalized account of an Army expeditionary unit's dispatch to find the lone surviving brother of five servicemen who were killed in action because of an obscure rule in the military that pertains to surviving siblings during war. The unit is led by quiet,dignified schoolteacher Captain John Miller(Tom Hanks,who really is a study in steady perseverance here)and the troops are predominantly young(i.e. 19 to 27 year old men)and prone to the usual emotional swings that occur amongst young men who are both brave but bewildered,uncertain of the mission and colored by their own personas.To say that this movie is manipulative would be an understatement,but then,how else does director Steven Spielberg roll? From the highly personal camera-work,simple yet emotive dialog and--last but not least--the grinding,crunching,raw,explosive sound,visual and special effects(and the editing that went with it!),this movie will most certainly draw a reaction out of you the viewer,whether positive(largely what I felt)or negative. To me,if a movie cannot be able to elicit a reaction,physical,emotional or both,then it really cannot be considered a potent film. Conversely,if it can create ANY reaction,then kudos to the makers. This film had me feeling a whole range of emotions through its run(much of it anger and low,grinding fear).I'm sure there are equal arguments as to the legitimacy of a military,historical or cultural film that Saving Private Ryan either is or isn't. Either way,this movie creates a powerful,raw and memorable feel that does not abate with watchings. Not a favorite,I suppose,but an excellent work of cinema. 9.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan I saw the film when if first came out, and I really liked it. Upon revisiting it, I've come to find the film to be very cheesy. The beginning and the ending were trite and contrived. My grandpa is a WWII vet so please don't think I'm being overly negative here ? I like what the film has to say, but I just think that it was executed way too on-the-nose. It should have been subtler. I think that the second act is beautifully done and exciting? story-wise, I was very into it. The sound design throughout is UNBELIEVABLE? I really felt like I was there with those soldiers. I also think that the cinematography was beautiful. There are moments of great work in this film, powerful work, in fact, but the tacky ending nearly ruined the whole experience for me. Spielberg has done better and worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only 12 years old and yet I think i felt the true meaning of this film-making masterpiece. First of all, the opening 24 minutes is the most gruesome, bloody, and most realistic war-scene I have ever seen. It makes me feel as if I was in one of those boats getting ready to fight for my life. The movie just gets better as it moves on. I grow attached to every single one of the characters and as i see them dropping one by one i can't help but to shed a tear. You might think just because I'm 12 that i like just the bloody battle scenes. But I always ponder the question "Is it right to save one man's life if it costs' you 5?" I simply do not know. Overall I believe that this is the by far the greatest war-movie of all time. The greatest overall movie might be pushing it a little but it is definitely one of my favorites. I've seen the movie about 6 times and after each and every time i see it about 5-6 weeks later I'm still thinking about it(especially the opening scene). This movie is simply incredible and if you have never seen it then what are you waiting for? This is definitely one of the greatest experiences you'll ever have after watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a Doubt, the Best War Film Thus Far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this gripping and grizzly film at the young age of 9! Yes, nine. Even at that age I felt the pain and and triumph of the soldiers. The first 25-minutes are so edge-of-your-seat material, that it's no wonder the majority of networks air this with little, if any, commercial interruption. This is one insane and intense film.Tom Hanks is great, as well as Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Spielberg's direction is so astounding, it's what makes this what is is: amazing. There's a t-o-n of gore and blood. The first 25-minutes as aforementioned are so gruesome, I'm surprised I didn't puke. Yet, Spielberg knows when we've seen enough, and when all goes quiet, it's almost like it just happened... in your very own living room.The music by John Williams is beautiful and haunting. From the hymn for the fallen to some of the battle cues, it's a very good score.The story is inspiring and terrifying, making it all the more real.Overall, Saving Private Ryan will absolutely shake you to the core in terms of seeing the war and feeling like you're in the thick of it. I highly recommend this to anyone with strong stomachs, because of it's epic story and "surreal" realism, it makes for a one-of-a-kind experience seldom seen in the majority of films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter Saving Private Ryan is the best bar none. The acting is monumental and the action is even more so. From it's gruelling cinematic opening through to it's profound ending, Saving Private Ryan delivers on all sides of excellence. Tom Hanks is compelling as Captain John H. Miller. Hanks hasn't portrayed anyone quite as captivating since his 1994 Oscar winning success in Forrest Gump.The visual concept is staggering and undeniably excels anything in the war genre. Praise to Spielburg though for giving audiences a tragic look inside to the horrors of war and its various other hellish topics.Cudoes to Saving Private Ryan's raw beauty and magnificence in re-creating the bloodiness and nightmarish abyss that was war. This being said, Saving Private Ryan is the best war film simply put and its visceral grit and substances shine boldly among others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg has brought us another masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that you could have heard about "Saving Private Ryan" is true.You may have heard about the opening battle footage. It's a little over twenty minutes long, and it's some of the most violent footage ever put to film. To be honest with you, I expected worse, but it's not so much the violence as much as the horror of it all. It's just sickening.(And I say that as a compliment)When the actual search for "Private Ryan" happens, you're introduced to the characters and their personalities. They're all very distinct. Some think that casting Tom Hanks as the captain was a bad choice, but I disagree. He's perfect. The rest of the cast is just as good. It features great actors that include Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi (I related to his character the most), Matt Damon, and a surprisingly good performance by actor/filmmaker, Ed Burns. The only actor I had a problem with was Jeremy Davies as the interpreter. I've seen Davies in several other movies ("Spanking the Monkey" and "Going All the Way") and he always plays the same annoying wuss character (picture Henry Thomas, but much skinnier and more geeky-looking). I dunno, maybe I'm just nit-picking. It WAS kinda necessary for the character. By the way, there's an interesting bit part played by a major TV celebrity. I don't know why he's in this movie, but it was an unexpected surprise.The script was written by Robert Rodat (who also wrote "Fly Away Home" and "Tall Tale") and had uncredited rewrites from Scott Frank (wrote "Dead Again" and adapted "Get Shorty" and the great "Out of Sight") and Frank Darabont (wrote the 1994 version of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," "A Nightmare on Elm Street III," and "The Fly II," but he's known best for writing and directing "The Shawshank Redemption"), and though it's not a perfect script, it's a damn good one. My biggest problem was the bookend parts set in the present. Unnecessary, I thought.Steven Spielberg is strange in that he'll make mindless movie blockbusters that are well-directed, but lack any substance, and then he'll turn around and make "The Color Purple," "Schindler's List," or "Saving Private Ryan." It almost seems as though he makes some movies just to fill his pockets, and then once his pockets are filled enough, he'll do something from the heart. Steven Spielberg truly is a genius filmmaker, and with as much acclaim as he gets now, he still seems underrated. I just can't believe that "Shakespeare In Love" got the Academy Award of best movie when this one was clearly a better film in every aspect. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>realism quotient right off the scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>thats right.many nitpickers claim the film is not realistic; clearly they have no experience with the countless detours, ad hoc actions, revised plans, FUBAR situations and the like that is part and parcel in the ebb and flow of combat.the business about Capt Miller's comment about 'the Germans having to change the barrel of their machine gun and this is the chance to attack' in the radar station scene is nitpicked by some based on their knowledge of German weaponry.well big fcukin deal, like no soldier ever made a mistake assessing the enemy's armaments? the scene simply ADDS to the realism, not subtracts from it.This is a benchmark war film which I have seen probably more than a dozen times. I have the D-Day commemorative version. Steven Spielberg really scooped the attention when it was released. And the opening scenes, good god, to have run through an unending hail of bullets and mortar shells, pinned down on a narrow strip of beach, nowhere to turn, death everywhere, what to do? feel free to view the documentary 'World at War' where they discuss the invasion in the episode 'Morning'. what happened, when the situation came to light with the commanders on board the battleships off shore that had escorted the troop carriers, after viewing with binoculars and hearing the radio reports, these commanders TOTALLY AGAINST STANDING ORDERS took it upon themselves to move in closer within range of the German batteries, and start dishing out some ordnance to the same German defenders in order to relieve the situation of the troops pinned down.you got that? THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO HELP OUT THEIR COMRADES ON THE BEACH.this is the whole story line of the film; self sacrifice towards a common goal. the details of which are merely that: 'filling in the canvas'.I'm just glad these men did such a good job 60+ years ago that my generation didn't have to repeat it somewhere else.as far as this being American 'propaganda', well feel free to write a script and produce your own work on the same topic. The fact is Omaha Beach, the 101st, bitching about Monty's hesitancy and numerous miscalculations are all part of the widely known history.therefore the realism, which I look for, of this film (as opposed to actual specific historical events) is right off the scale. I don't care if its a sci-fi, comedy, western, or drama, I have to see continuous PLAUSIBILITY in what I'm spending my time and money on.this film, SPR, has that in abundance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got into this movie expecting a high budget, unreal, action adventure. Boy was I wrong. As I watched the soldiers storm Omaha beach, I was amazed at how good the action was. But, as I continued to watch the action, I started to realize that there was much more to it. Amidst all the chaos, plain as day, were the dying soldier's cries for their mothers, the explosions full of severed limbs and torsos, and the general chaos caused by the death and destruction. And then it hit me, this must be what the war was really like. And it wasn't good.Asides from the message of the movie, the characters were AMAZING. Tom Hanks, Adam Goldberg, Matt Damon- I have to say that I think these are the best performances of their careers. They were just so real... I really felt for these guys.So, if you are looking for a movie full of the ra ta tas of machine guns, high budget explosions, and plenty of action, this movie is for you. But if you are not ready to experience war like it really is, then maybe you should pick a different DVD at the rental store. But, if your minds and your stomachs are ready for this film, then brace yourself for the best movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unmatched WWII masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, many war movies try to get it right, but completely fail. Great war movies only come around every so often, such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now. However, if you notice something, all of the movies I just listed are all about Vietnam. Those 3 movies have all been considered for "greatest war movie of all time", but we haven't seen a "great" WWII movie in quite a while. Well, the wait is over. Saving Private Ryan is also in the list, and near the top as well.Reinacting a battle like D-Day will almost always fail in cinema. However, Steven Spielberg gets it right and more. Also, when you watch the battle scenes, it makes any other war movie battle look completely lame. I know that veterans say that if you haven't seen real combat, then you just haven't, and I do respect that. It is true. However, when you talk about combat in the movies, Saving Private Ryan is as close as you can come.Tom Hanks, once again displaying his talent, plays the roll of Captain John H. Miller as if he was really in the military. Tom Hanks is just one of those actors who can play all types of roles, and play them amazingly seemingly without even trying.There isn't much else to say about Saving Private Ryan, mostly because I just can't find any other words to describe its brilliance.Saving Private Ryan has its rightful place in history as one of the greatest war films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fresh perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Saving Private Ryan' is Steven Spielberg's brave attempt to redefine the conventional war film, and specifically World War II films. More than that even, it's an attempt to explain the conflict itself to a generation that never knew it firsthand. Spielberg proceeds from the assumption that baby boomers are hardwired to doubt their country's motives in any war and 'Saving Private Ryan' seems to be his way of saying there was at least one war the U.S. fought where it was clearly and completely in the right. Whether he succeeded is something that's difficult to gauge. In many ways, 'Saving Private Ryan' is your standard-issue combat flick, albeit a very well-made one. Some scenes would be almost interchangeable with those from any number of movies where G.I.'s trudge across Europe and engage the Germans at various points in heated battles. But there's something else at work here that none of those earlier films put across in quite the same manner. At times, it's almost intangible. There is a feeling of the here and now about the film, that we are really living and experiencing what the soldiers did. Nothing puts this across more vividly than the opening scene. After a brief prologue in a present-day French cemetery, the scene shifts to the bloodiest day of the war, when the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches. I think it is fair to say that there has never been a more realistic depiction of what the first few army units faced in those first awful hours, the chaos, the death, the wholesale slaughter really of thousands of young men trying to gain a foothold on the beaches there. I remember reading about an early screening of 'Ryan' for WW2 veterans; one was asked about this scene, and the old man replied grimly and succinctly, "That's pretty much how it was." Though nothing in the rest of the film is quite as brutally graphic, the scene sets the stage for what is to follow. We are reminded that the vast majority of Americans were not professional soldiers; they were ordinary people lifted from ordinary jobs to fight in the most consequential armed conflict in their country's history, which makes their sacrifices and their courage that much more profound and poignant. The story, which can easily be seen as an allegory, has to do with a group of four brothers, all soldiers serving in the war. And all have been killed in action, except one, the Private Ryan of the title. It is decided that this family has sacrificed more than its share, and so a special army squad is dispatched to find Ryan and send him home. Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the everyman, generically-named Capt. Miller, the schoolteacher turned combat soldier. His dying words to Private Ryan, "Earn this. Earn it!" are the message he (and Spielberg) hoped the following generation would take to heart. Again, it's hard to know whether or not that generation has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>September 18, 1998 (The day i saw this movie) Throughout the years,there have been war movies that brought back horrendous memories to veterans who fought in war; to movie buffs it showed how war can tear up an individual or showed why it was worth fighting for. In Steven Spielberg's war drama, it is not a division between what's good and bad, but to show homage to those who fought in the biggest war of the 20th century.The first 20 minutes of the prologue is one of the most gruesome battle scenes I've ever watched on screen. We see the boats boarding up soldiers as they are heading to the murky beaches of Normandy June 6, 1942, which will be remember to most people as the worst battle in history. Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, who leads his squad in the terror battle and tries to find his team into the breach as hundreds of soldiers die. As realistic as it is, we see the carnage of soldiers getting ripped in pieces, crying for their mothers, and in one scene we see a man looking for his amputated arm.After the grizzly attack on the beach, Miller has been ordered another mission; a manhunt for the lost of one soldier after losing three of his brothers at Normandy, and throughout the film we get to see some of the most realistic battles since "Platoon," where the violence and gore plays an important part of the realism; but also get a chance to see to recognize the characters during the non-violent parts which reminded audiences members of how these soldiers were like a family."Saving Private Ryan" is one of the best war flicks I have ever seen on the screen. With a great all star cast from Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Vin Diseal, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Rebisi, Paul Giamatti and more. This is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest work ever made</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting feature of Steven Spielberg, probably the most reliable hit maker outside the Michael Bay realm of idiocy, is that he often seems very clumsy with things that are the furthest away from the technical aspect of his films. There's often a quality of naiveté that simply would make the film more interesting and adult if it just was cut.Saving Private Ryan has one such annoyance. And that is a rather common one; claiming a war as one side's story. In Private Ryan, this would be the bookend scenes which serve no purpose to the story, but to cram the supposed message down the viewer's throat. Every country has had its wars, it is insulting to millions to claim the story of human suffering in war is exclusive to one person, one side or one war. Also, Schindler's List has similar scenes that begin and end the film, although they are not as bad.While everything in Private Ryan is technically as good as it will ever get, the story and the characters seem out of place. The only properly fleshed out characters are Hank's mysterious captain and Davies' inexperienced clerk that obviously serves as the characters most people can relate to. The rest of the characters aren't that memorable if you think of them as personalities, not ranks. And, Tom Sizemore plays a sergeant here, the believability coming from the fact he's played the same role about a zillion times. There are a few interesting cameos with Ted Danson and Dennis Farina.The story, while a typical "road movie with soldiers" at least is not as standard as a retelling of a battle, is nowhere near Apocalypse Now or other movies treating soldiers as passers by. It's near to a typical Hollywood version of a war mission and something you could imagine John Wayne doing. This obviously was the purpose, making an old fashioned war movie, but it clashes with the realistic battle scenes.The battle scenes. They simultaneously make battle look like something horrible, something you want to be a part of and actually instantly create a bunch of clichés. Details such as the exaggerated sound of a M1 carbine running out of ammo (a very common detail if you watch a WW2 movie made after this OR even better - play a WW2 video game), the scene in which someone is talking and suddenly is hit to the head, the scene in which the viewer (situated in the middle of the fighting) can't hear anything because of shell shock. Whoa.Interestingly, this movie proves the quote: you can't make an anti-war movie and not make war look even more sexy in the end.I'm not saying Saving Private Ryan is a bad movie. I'm just saying a lot of its flaws are glossed over thanks to the execution and respect to war veterans (who I of course respect as well, not depending of the side). Essentially, a similar film with better characters, similar technical awesomeness and fact instead of fairytale is the miniseries Band of Brothers, another project from Hanks and Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts with the most intense scenes of all time. It just takes you there and makes you bite your tongue. I can't imagine how nobody (at least I don't remember) have ever done before the up-down-water thing Spielberg did in the beginning. It just blow me away with se sounds and the images. Really amazing and so simple that you can't understand how nobody else has got that before, but I guess that is what makes Spielberg such a great director.The reality in this film is amazing, you can feel the blood and the sweat and the screams. You feel like fighting yourself. But the realism isn't perfect. The camera movements etc. makes for a wonderfully looking and realistic film but the fighting scenes in the end.. come on. The Tiger tank was it's time most deadly killing machine ever invented, it was impenetrable. How on earth you destroy that with a sticky bomb. And how can you run freely around it, it had MGs at almost every side.Anyway that is a minor flaw because these little unrealistic things just build up the atmosphere.Spielberg, one of our time's greatest director, shows once again his only weakness.. sentimentality. American banners everywhere, no signs of UK, Canadian or any other county's soldiers. That overly sentimental bs popped up to my eyes only a couple of times though so it's not a real problem.Overall the film is superb and keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end, the almost complete reality, the characters... nice movie.The last thing Hankses character says left me thinking: "earn this". That is the most terrible but also meaningfull thing a person can say before dying to a man he just saved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lieutenant Colonel Anderson puts Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) on a search and rescue assignment to find Private Ryan and send him home to his mom. Along the way they stumble into Captain Hamill and Sergeant Hill. They take out a sniper, suffer losses when they battle some Germans, and they bond together in a church and along the way find out about Captain Miller's home life.Steven Spielberg directs this epic masterpiece and his amazing sidekick Michael Kaun edits. The story by Robert Rodat is realistic and an accurate representation of D-Day. The story is told in a flashback process of Private Ryan remembering back to when Captain Miller saved his life.The excellent casting, the special, visual effects are stunning, the acting at the top of it's game, the gripping story, and the realism of it all makes this one worthwhile of many, many viewings. It is one of the best movie of the 90's and it's possibly Hank's best performance of his career.To not watch this and enjoy would be a tragedy and I'd have to question that person as to why they didn't enjoy it. It's simply too great to not entertain you. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Best of Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is renowned for its realistic portrayal of the D-Day assault on German occupied France. This film is unlike any other war movie you will ever see.Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) survives the landings on Omaha beach but then has an even greater challenge thrust upon him. Three of the four Ryan brothers are killed within days of each other and the U.S. army chief of staff, General George C. Marshall decides that every effort must be made to return the fourth brother (Matt Damon) home to the broken hearted mother. Unfortunately he was parachuted behind enemy lines and no one knows where he is. Captain Miller is ordered to lead a team to rescue him. He faces all the challenges of a 'behind enemy lines' mission along with the inevitable question of why his men must risk all their lives for just one private. Sit back, turn off the mobile and allow yourself to be taken on a stunning visual spectacle. You are thrust face first into the horrifying drama of the D-Day landings and witness dramatic close quarter conflict. But this is more than a war story. The human characteristics of leadership, bravery, fear, grief, decency and much more are all skillfully examined. The set is completely convincing even thought many of the scenes were shot outside France.The film won five Oscars including the Directing and Cinematography categories but very unjustly lost to 'Shakespeare in Love' for best picture.This movie is a true masterpiece of terror, chaos, blood, and courage.It's safe to say Saving Private Ryan popularized a lot of the "war techniques" you've seen lately, and that the consequences of Saving Private Ryan's brutal portrayal of war will be felt for a long time coming.Saving Private Ryan may not be as beautiful, lyrical, or complex as (for example) Malick's Thin Red Line, but it will certainly influence a lot of films that will come after it (more so than Malick's masterpiece) for the better. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WW2, As real as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a history genius, I have seen many war movies in my day, but none have really put it all out there as this movie did. Steven Speidberg didn't hold anything back in this movie, especially in the beginning scenes into the breach. This movie was made as a testament to the greatest generation that ever lived, and to the greatest army unit that ever lived, the 1st army rangers, to believe these men climbed up 100ft cliffs, with MG-42 machine gun fire pouring down on them, and all the time, all the Germans had to do was roll boulders down on theme, and cut their lines, but they still made it up the cliffs to destroy the MG Nests. No other movie shows so many bullets flying around and so much constant action going all around you in all angles, from people trying to find there very own body parts from the many that are lying around from other men, just the beginning 40 minutes of this movie will give you all you can really handle, because your thinking how many GI's can possibly survive just the invasion of the beaches. Not only that, but you feel so helpless for the GI's because if they don't take the beach, they are in a world of s*** because there is no where to retreat to, in this moment in history, the world came to suspenseful pause to watch which superpower was going to be the big boy on the block, wethere it was Germany's Fascism, or Americas Democracy. I am just tallking about the first 40 minutes, now its your job to see the whole movie, trust me, you will not be disappointed, I personally see this movie minimally, once every 3-4 weeks, and yes that bayonet seen with Pvt. Mellish is heart-breaking, the drama is classic, as you see Mellish breath slower, and slower, as that bayonet slides further and further into his heart and then he twitches less and less, and all the while his scared bastard comrade upham is hiding shi**** his pants off, man what a thrill ride this movie is, it is said to make grown men slightly break a tear, and for all you real WW2 fans go and invest in Medal of Honor: Airborne, it looks like the next generation in WW2 Combat, the realism and the graphics are unmatched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows you away, and makes you land in the horrific war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well the first time I saw the movie I was totally blown away by its proportions, the reality of the action sequences, and the authenticity. It is the first time we get to see the "real" reality of war so closely and without holding back any punches.The first sequence where they try to enter the beach is really scary and if you have a weak heart will shake you to your soul. The sound of the bullets, the blood, the torn bodies, it just pulls you of your feet and makes you land in the middle of that horrific war. The direction is just genius, the story is engaging with just the right amount of emotions in the mix. Steven Spielberg did a brilliant job with this, he gives you all the facts of the situation and lets you decide whether it was right for all those 8 men to lay their lives on the line to save just one guy.I have never had any doubt that Tom Hanks is a great actor but in this movie he just raises the bar for acting, he should have won the Oscar for this role. He just makes you believe he is Captain Miller and engages you in his own world.All the character actors are good and play their part well, they play with your emotions and make you connect with them.Its a must watch if you are a war movie fan, and even if you are not</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut wrenching depiction of Normandy invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading several of the negative comments about this film, I concluded that they could be grouped into a handful of categories, the pedantic, the America haters, and those who find innate fault with the Spielbergian tendency to manipulate the audience. For those in the Spielberg hating camp, I would ask, What do you expect? Audience manipulation is every bit a hallmark of a Spielberg film as a sappy ending is to a Capra film or existential Jewish angst is to an Allen film.As for the other two categories, it doesn't pretend to be an historically accurate film, it is a dramatization. For the people that feel that Spielberg depicts the Americans as purely good or the Germans as purely evil, I would ask you to go back to two scenes, one where GIs summarily execute a surrendering German, and second, the look of compassion in the eyes of the German sniper when the GI he has just shot is trying to hand off a letter to his family.That said, I would focus on the technical aspects of the film. The initial scene of the invasion looks just like first hand accounts of the Omaha beach invasion I have read. Veterans of the landing who have seen the film have attested to the authentic look and feel of the film. Perhaps what I find most striking is Spielberg's use of old style cameras and film stock that give the movie an old newsreel type flavor.I won't argue with anyone who accuses the actual mission as being unrealistic--I would say that the mission itself is secondary to the storytelling art. It takes little vignettes assembled from stories I have heard over and over from WW2 vets and tells them succinctly.Hank's character suffers from PTSD, known then as "battle fatigue" ; Vin Diesel's character was the guy who forgot for one second to keep his head down and it cost him; the interpreter overcomes his initial cowardice after it costs his buddy's life; overcome with emotion, another character wants to summarily execute an unarmed German, but is talked out of it; two opposing soldiers who have lost their arms attack each other hand to hand. All of these stories are archetypal and universal among veterans who survived the war.These characters represent the amalgam of experience of all combat soldiers; similar to Platoon, its unrealistic to believe that one small group of soldiers experienced them all, but as a dramatization the story is excellently filmed and told.</fullReview>

It stars Tom Hanks as John Miller a soldier who is hired to take his team to find Private Ryan, a fellow soldier who's three brothers have died in combat. They are told to find him and bring him back even though it is unlikely that he is still alive.Saving Private Ryan was an amazing movie that shows the true teamwork and brotherhood between soldiers in a war. It also has some brilliant acting performances by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel and Matt Damon. This movie somehow manages to have gross and disgusting action sequences but at the same time it is very touching and moving.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.9/10</fullReview>

The battle scene in the start was brilliantly shot, i don't if thats how things are in a war,but i think it was an ambush and so it was acceptable. People who haven't seen the movie, do check it out if you are an admirer of war movies. Acting of Matt dammon and Tom Hanks was really good, no name a few. Its a fast paced movie doesn't get u always think about the brutality of wars,but the thought of mankind killing fellow mankind to extend their boundary lines or to show their superiority but The story line was new but don't know if thats how things happened at the time of war, 10 people having on the line to save guy.

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of five Academy Awards® including Best Director, the film also captured Oscars® for Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound and Sound Effects Editing. More than 70 critics and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, Dallas Ft-Worth and Great Britain named the film Best Picture of the Year, while the Los Angeles, Toronto and Broadcast Film Critics honored it with both Best Picture and Best Director awards. In addition, Spielberg received his third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion "The Spirit of Normandy" Award, a USO Merit Award from the USO of Metropolitan Washington, as well as the highest civilian public service award from the Department of the Army. Selected for more than 160 Top Ten lists, Saving Private Ryan's other honors include Golden Globes for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director, the Producers Guild of America Award and ten nominations from the British Academy Film Awards. Saving Private Ryan was the top-grossing motion picture of 1998.Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage.As I have watched this movie, I was astounded and amazed with this brilliant and perfectly made film. I think no war movie can replace this one. While watching it, it really seems like you're with them in a real war. The plot and story are great! You'll really feel what war is. It's sad, emotional, and historical. You will realize that life is important even with your enemies. Unity and courage are the morals of this movie. I insist you watch this movie. You'll surely enjoy and watch it over and over and over again! I'll give this perfect 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes of this movie are perhaps the most compelling 30 minutes of cinema ever filmed.The chaos of war, the moral decisions made and not made, the bravery of those under fire on *both* sides... all is here.As the plot continues, you see more moral ambiguity, and more moral certainty. War *is* hell, and that is clearly seen here.Tom Hanks gives his best performance (just ahead of Philadelphia), and all of the featured players perform more than admirably.I do need to give a shout-out to the Translator. He is the one in this piece who I can most closely identify with... an intellectual forced by his own convictions to join the war effort, but struggling with the realities of the war. I fully understand his fear, and his strength.</fullReview>

I notice more and more things, recognize more actors and notice more mistakes.Things that annoy me. Hanks salutes his superior when he goes for his "find Ryan" briefing but his translator is chastised for doing the same, why? The men that don't spot the Panzerfaust leaning against the wall when their trying to stop the 25mm gun from flanking them. It's right there in plain view in the middle of the screen leaning against a wall and not one of 4 men spotted it.This time I did see Ted Danson and that weirdo who played Riddick. Second time in a week for the guy who played Phoebe's brother in Friends to be on telly (he's also been on twice in Gone In 60 Seconds).the film is excellent.If your considering ever joining the military of ANY country, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this movie was a work of pure genius. It is by far the best work of Steven Spielberg, and one of the best film works in general. From the historical accuracy to the amazing acting jobs (even from those people who came into the project as nobodies) to the brilliant filming style, this movie has all the areas covered. Although through some of the battle scenes there are areas of excessive gore, the fights are well done and extensive enough to give everyone a thrill.This movie gives the viewer(s) a perfect window into what it was like to be in that squad, or to be in the military in general during that period of the fighting. In depth description of John Miller, the attitude and mannerisms of Melish, the emotions of loss and despair, and all of these other elements compiled and created the perfect opportunity for someone to witness those events, to be in that place at that time, and gave the chance for veterans or those affiliated with the war a chance to reflect.Saving Private Ryan was, is, and always will be one of the greatest movies ever made. Naysayers may site a shaky 'documentary' filming style as a bad reason, but this adds to the 'window' into these soldiers adventure. They may say that it contains a very cliché plot line, which may be true to some degree, but the film makers, actors, and writers alike gave it an unforgettable element that made it captivating. These are a few things among many negative accusations made but let me assure you that they are dead wrong. DEAD wrong. This movie is not deserving of the title of 'one of the best war movies'. It deserves 'The Best War Movie'. Saving Private Ryan is a work of genius, a Must-See, and a Must-Have-McAirellPS Questions, comments, anything? e-mail -&gt; theoneeggy@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of WWII movies and was looking forward to this movie. I had heard so many great things about it. I was very disappointed. The actual photography and special effects were great. The actions of the people involved to make little sense. The opening at Normandy was well done but I didn't understand mixing the humor with the gore. But it was good at showing the brutality. Now the men at the center of the action were experienced soldiers. We see them using their wits in using mirrors to look around corners, not exposing them selves to enemy fire, etc. Everything is fine. Then comes the set up, trying to find the one private in the sea of humanity. Okay, so they look and finally find him. Now the logic seems to completely desert the men and they act so stupid which is a complete 180 from how they acted at the start of the movie. If they had no combat experience that is one thing but to start the movie showing how smart they are, then wind up the way they did just was too much for me.Okay, I accept the decision to stay and fight for no real good reason because things like that happen. But then they start running out in front of tanks, stand still while tanks point their guns at them, sit on their butts when they run out of ammo, and to not even try to find out where the bridge was in relation to the army? As it turns out if they had not lured the Germans into their "trap" their fighters and the whole column would have been up to deal with them without any pointless fighting. Okay well that could have been a stupid decision but to have the men act they didn't have a clue about war, they didn't just go through the brutality of the invasion, was just so contrived it was too much for the suspension of believe normally called for.I really don't understand why so many people liked it. It seems like the fact that Spielberg directed it gives in an extra 4 points. Obviously I am in the minority here. Maybe I watched too many episodes of "Combat" growing up and my expectation were too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although 'Saving Private Ryan' portrays excellent cinematography and probably a pretty accurate sense of being in a battle in the second World War, the film failed to do anything more. This film was probably made for its battle scenes, which I cannot fault at all and for which this movie does earn some credit for. However, in terms of story and characters, the film fails. Along with the story, the film has too many slow movements; overall, it is too long and tends to drag on. If they had spent as much time on the story as much as they spent on the cinematography, then we would have had a much better film. Watch it for the battle scenes and history if you watch it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American army are about to land at the Omaha beach in France. The moment they land its a blood soaked fight to take the beach. In this fight is Captain Miller and his troop of men. After the Omaha assault, Miller is given a mission to find a man and take him out from behind enemy lines. The man is Private James Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and to bereave his mother the American Army want him home. Ryan's location is unknown as his paratroop were miss dropped. Miller and his troop now have to go behind enemy lines to find Ryan, that is if he's still alive.Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding war drama from master director Steven Spielberg. The opening beach scene is so brutally violent and harshly real, yet it honestly conveys the horror of the war. This was the first movie I saw that violent, but accurately, portrayed the violent nature of war and the emotions of the soldiers. You are placed right into the battle; with people being dismembered and shot apart. The final fight at the bridge crossing is the most intense battle of the film. It doesn't have the sheer unrelenting violence of the opening battle, but it is so emotionally charged.Though the violence is confronting, but there is so much drama and character depth behind the violence. All the people of Millers troop are three dimensional, you can emotionally attach to them. They all are bonded too, you can see their comradeship between them. There is also that naivety to them; they will follow their captain not just on orders but they trust him without question. Captain Miller has so much depth to him. You don't find a lot about him, yet you can tell there is much anguish and longing to leave in his face.Spielberg has taken a more head first look into the second world war. Shinder's List was about the men behind the scenes and the politics, while in Saving Private Ryan we are taken to the view of the soldier. Spielberg's direction is flawless, getting you right into the battle and evoking so much emotion from all the actors. The acting is also flawless. Tom Hanks gives one the his best performances ever, he was brilliant. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies all bring great performances as the mix matched group of people, their friendship for all of them was so believable. Matt Damon though only appearing towards the end as Private Ryan does a great job also.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, it is a masterpiece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Steven Spielberg has done with "Saving Private Ryan" is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of World War II and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing -- a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death. The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell, so only the typists survive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a good movie so far as action scenes and depicting the horror of war is concerned. So far as plot and historical accuracy goes ... well, as it was once said: "Very few things happen at the right time and the rest do not happen at all. The conscientious historian will correct these defects." This is a feature that doesn't seem to bother too many people, however.The whole movie is based on a laughable premise. When Private Ryan's three siblings are killed in the war, Captain Miller is given an assignment to take a squad of men and go find Ryan. Private Ryan is, of course, behind enemy lines and the mission is highly dangerous (suicidal, actually). And here we find our very distant relationship to reality: "The plot was inspired in part by the true story of Fritz Niland, one of four brothers from New York state who saw action during the war. Two Niland brothers were killed on D-Day, while another was missing in action in Burma and was presumed dead, although he actually survived. Fritz was located in Normandy by an Army chaplain, Reverend Francis Sampson, and taken out of the combat zone." So, where a priest managed to do the job singlehandedly in real life, it now takes a squad of battle-hardened soldiers (oh, and a perpetually cringing typist - THAT was a good idea) to be sent to their doom by the loving United States government. The soldiers are, of course, acutely aware of this fact, and they spend no shortage of time dwelling on it for the viewer's pleasure before they finally end up getting killed. Spielberg appears to have a bone to pick with the U.S. Government (and there were, to be sure, bones to be picked), but it would be nice if this one were at least grounded in reality - and if he weren't quite so preachy. For viewers somewhat versed in history and who require a believable plot to enjoy a movie, Saving Private Ryan feels like summer stock in an iron lung. Couple this with Spielberg's typical cheese-ball antics (flashbacks, flash-forwards, women swooning, men swooning!, anything to create an emotional effect with the least possible effort), and you've got yourself some Academy Award-winning eye candy that will forever serve as the gold standard in WWII movies.(Just as an aside, Tom Hanks apparently recognized the irony behind Saving Private Ryan since he went on to produce a well-done 10-hour HBO mini-series on the 101st Airborne entitled "Band of Brothers" which, in contrast, IS actually believable, which might have something to do with the fact that it employs some amount of historical accuracy. You'd be better off watching Band of Brothers, unless you enjoy the feeling of being brainwashed.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'haunting' does not begin to describe the effect of this WWII epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the second world war, a selected group of U.S. soldiers is sent to bring back a comrade who is stationed behind enemy lines. This man's brothers have been slaughtered on D-Day, and he is being sent back home.The plot is noticeably silly. in war, especially THIS war, high ranking officers would not send a squadron out to retrieve one man who holds no vital information about the enemy. Nor would they send squadrons out to retrieve men whose blood has been slaughtered.But It is not the plot that drives a person to see a movie of deeply realistic and harrowing violence. A person watches this movie to go back in time. Many people (thankfully) will never have to fight in wars, and therefore would never know the true meaning of terror."Saving Private Ryan" is said to have been the most accurate war picture ever to be created. Watching it is almost as close as fighting a real war. you are with the countless men who are destroyed when the U.S. storm the beaches of Normandy. You sit through all of the personal conflict among soldiers. You witness the emotions change and tempers flare. And most of all, you experience a time warp.A movie crafted this well is a true gift; a piece of entertainment that is so well done that it makes us forget that we are sitting at home watching a movie with Hollywood actors. This film will become your world. as terrifying and depressing as it is, it will become your world.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply... Great!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a great WWII movie. It was one of the first movies in an ever-growing ultra-realistic WWII accounts. Being an avid WWII history buff, SPR gives me an insight into what it was like to be on the beach at Normandy. Hanks and Spielberg really show their concern for detail in SPR and their later work, Band of Brothers. I would have given the movie a 10 if is wasn't for the poor performance of Matt Damon. Damon comes off as a whiny little snot nose. The director should have caught this and worked it out as it is very distracting. Some people, especially of late, have said this film is too graphic to show on TV. However, I really feel this is a film that does not make gratuitous (sorry for the spelling) use of graphic images. That is what it looked like and it should be shown like that. Every network shows the warning before they air the movie and so we should all be smart enough that if it's too much, FLIP THE CHANNEL! Don't complain that it was too graphic when you were warned. A movie as realistic as this is going to be graphic which adds to the impact it makes. Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That and "FUBAR: Fucked Up Beyond All Repair" are two great lines from this movie. The writing is both believable and nowhere near approaching any worry of clichés polluting the movie. The direction is superb, probably what started out the usage of hand-held cameras which have now been way overused in movies since then. Steven Spielberg really brought his A-Game to this one. Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham was good in this movie as he was able to portray cowardice in a war movie, which people rarely do and did it very well. Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Wade almost stole the show when he talks about how his mother would come home early just to see him and he would pretend to be asleep. This ties in to something later on. Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo seemed very much like a weak-link, only there to get killed. OK performance, but nothing really to write home about. Adam Goldberg as Private Mellish who i've only really seen otherwise in "Friends" as Chandler's roommate Eddie. Didn't really expect he would be all that good but he put in a great performance as the Jewish soldier and when he gets stabbed later on in the movie, heartstrings are pulled. Barry Pepper as Private Jackson has worked with Tom Hanks in both Saving Private Ryan and the magnificent "The Green Mile" and in both of those movies he has held his own against the star Tom Hanks and that is good work. Best when he goes to shoot someone with a rifle and says a couple of prayers. Edward Burns as Private Reiben isn't that bad, he does well and was touted as the Next Big Thing but hasn't fulfilled it yet. Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath is extremely good, definitely became a fan after this movie, both thumbs up. Matt Damon as Private Ryan is the macguffin of the movie and actually has a small part in the movie, less than an hour and becomes just as much a part of this movie as the others. And the star of the movie,Tom Hanks as Captain Miller does a magnificent job leading his men as they attempt to rescue a guy that they know nothing about that is thought of as just another number until Ryan tells Miller about the last night he and his brothers were together and Ryan became another human. That should explain the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic depiction of wartime battle (Major spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg made his second historical visit to the time of World War II (following up from his acclaimed Schindler's List) with this tale of a group of American soldiers, assigned to find Private Ryan, the sole survivor of a family of brothers killed in the war.The group assigned to find him are world-weary Captain Miller (Tom Hanks); his right-hand man Sergeant Hovarth (Tom Sizemore); sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper); wise-guy Jew Mellish (Adam Goldberg) and translater Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), a bookish sort who's never been in battle...This ensemble is played by a gallery of seasoned natural actors. Tom Hanks gives probably his most subtle performance as the besieged Miller, capturing the dizzy tiredness of a man who's sick of fighting. Sizemore is fine as Horvarth and Pepper, Goldberg and Davies are good in their various roles, giving their stock characters a distinctiveness and humanity. Matt Damon is given the pivotal role of Private Ryan, and plays him in much the same way as he played Will Hunting: a petulant, obnoxious moron who does not engender much sympathy.The story, especially with reference to recent world events, feels like a US propaganda tool. Watching it, especially if you're uninformed of history, you'd think the Americans were the only ones fighting the Nazis. Other Allied Groups (the British, the French and the Russians) are never seen or referred to any way.Where the film really succeeds is in its portrayal of wartime battle, surely the most realistic depiction committed to film. The film is shot in harsh realistic tones, with a lot of grey and brown. The grime, blood and gore of combat is far from overlooked.The opening attack on Omaha Beach is excellent, and you can feel the frantic, fearful adrenaline of the soldiers as they rush into the line of fire and are randomly picked off one-by-one. The Germans who surrender in eventual defeat are randomly shot dead. The concluding battle to defend the bridge is even better as the characters we've come to know over two hours are decimated or worse than that changed by their ordeals. However it is not the guns and bomb battles that really convey the wasteful nature of war. It is the hand-to-hand combat scene Mellish has with a German soldier while Upham cowers on stairs. The German gets the upper hand and slowly forces Mellish's knife into his stomach, gently rocking him to sleep as he does so. This is what it ultimately boils down to: the savage nature of fighting, and possessing (or losing) the will to remain on your feet and stay alive. It is this reality, encapsulated in that scene, that the film captures so very well.It will not stand up as a historical document (few war movies do) but in bringing the realities of wartime battle home to a mass audience, "Saving Private Ryan" is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin my praise, let me just say that my grandfather served during WW2 (82nd airborne), my father served during Vietnam and I myself was in basic when the crap hit the fan in Iraq the first time around. To be honest, when I first saw the trailer for this film I had thought it was just some average Hollywood vehicle for Matt Damon and did not bother to see it in the movies. boy was I wrong. Like the Godfather, Goodfellas and JFK I can't help but watch this film each and every time it comes on cable. I never get sick of it. Just the invasion of Normandy Beach scene is worth the $3 rental charge. Bataan was good, Patton excellent but this has to be the best WW2 picture to date. Probably as close to realism as a movie can get - meaning when troops get shot they just don't fall down ala "windtalkers" - heads are blown off, body parts are everywhere and blood pours down like rain. It is always good to see a film of this quality come around every once in awhile to remind us not to forget those who have given their lives so that we could live ours. Now I know why my parents always taught me to respect my elders.....I also recommend "Band of Brothers" which was inspired by this film and also brilliantly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most grueling and realistic war movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan has to be one of the best war movies ever made, but it is definitely the most realistic. The opening battle is considered to be the most realistic war scenes ever caught on film. The fear and tension of the D-Day invasion is so frighteningly realistic in Saving Private Ryan.Despite the graphic and gruelingly intense violence, most kids older than 10 should see this to get an idea of what war veterans have had to fight through. Steven Spielberg once again proves he is capable of awesome directing skills through Saving Private Ryan.Unfortunately, I missed this when it was out in the theaters, but the great cinematography and direction must have been awesome to experience on the silver screen. I hope there will be a tenth anniversary showing of this in theaters everywhere. Although the running time is a bit long, Saving Private Ryan is well worth seeing, every shot and camera angle is brilliance. See this movie on the biggest screen possible with the best surround sound possible and you'll feel as though you're actually there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seen Spielberg doing such a B-movie before this!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I can understand the story can grab your attention, but...C'mon!!! Do you really want me to believe that the life of that one kid is worth a whole team of dead soldiers?!? And that the President of America himself took care of it! What kind of useless rhetoric, in the worst American B-movie tradition! That is NOT what I expect from a Steven Spielberg's movie. And what about when, after all this absurdity, they meet Pvt. Ryan (at last!), and he refuses to come back, because of "bla bla bla..."?!? If I wore Tom Hanks' character, I would have shot him at once!!! On the other hand, we must admit that the famous opening scene of Normandy Attack is one of the best of the whole movie history: scaring, rhythmic, impressive, realistic,... this is Spielberg! So, as an overall, I would rate 10 for the opening scene, but 0 for the rest (it would be 3, if it wasn't Spielberg: we can not let him waste his talent like that), so, as an average, I just give 5.One last suggestion for everybody: rent the DVD, watch the opening scene (maybe even twice, or more...), and then bring it back to the shop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as a drinking game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have made a lot of money from this movie. While watching it with a friend I kept saying "he is going to die now" and guess what...he did. Now if only I had made a bet of $10 each time that happened I would have had made enough to cover my movie ticket, the price of the popcorn and drink, plus I would have been able go out to a café afterwards.The plot is interesting. A group of American soilders must cross the scattered D-day lines to find a soldier whose brothers have all been killed so he can be sent home because the President of the US of A promised that he could.The them of this movie is obvious. People made sacrifices to keep the world safe during world war II. Do we as a generation live up to those sacrifices. My view is, nope, you bastards took Vietnam away from a pro-American Ho Chi Min and gave it to the French (then Ho Chi Min got angry and kicked your American butts as you deserve). You rounded up the communists in Greece at the end of WWII and had them shot (so of course they had a communist uprising later).This is a sad pathetic and obvious movie that tries to justify America to Americans.The only thing that makes up for that is the honesty of the war scenes and truth in the characters (other than Private Ryan who turns out to by some sort of Uber American symbol so we can feel good about him being saved).Watch it with friends so you can play the Saving Private Ryan drinking game. It works like this, people call out the names of characters they think are going to die. If they do die within 5 minutes everyone drinks, if they don't the person who called out drinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best buddy movie ever (please, don't flame me).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a buddy movie. I'd love to get on my soapbox and quote 'Henry V' at you all day long, but the bottom line is, this movie is all about buddies. I am not interested in molecularly accurate historical fact, so I wasn't bombed out by some small insignificant detail. Instead, I chose to feel how these men, these ordinary men, felt, and how they treated each other. I griped a bit about the lack of back-stories about some of the men (like Reiben or Jackson), but then I realized that they were just like you and me. We all know the story of you and me, and the story moves confidently because of that, without being bogged down by too many flashbacks to an earlier life that would have hurt the pacing.The cinematography is really good because you get close-ups on their faces a lot of the time, and other close-ups on important things like hands and bleeding corpses and so on (unlike We Were Soldiers, which suffered from too many wide shots). As a result, you get to see every little crook in their expressions and every facial tic, so you feel for them much more. Focusing on Tom Hanks' hands was one of the most well-chosen shots ever, because it showed the vulnerability of the man without too much exposition or violence.Additionally, let me say that all the actors put in their best performances for this movie. While Matt Damon was a little stiff, the rest were Oscar gold as they grimaced and swore through the movie, and there was never the 'politically correct' feeling that crippled other war movies. I'd like to highlight three awesome actors who deserve to be paid in nothing but solid Academy gold. Medic Wade, played by Giovanni 'Vonnie' Ribisi, Corporal Upham, played by Jeremy Davies, and of course the lead actor himself, Tom Hanks in the role of John Miller. All three delivered powerful (in Upham's case, powerfully pathetic) performances, and the final scene, you truly get to see the groundbreaking ability of Tom Hanks. Ribisi is notable because of one particular conversation that, if handled by a lesser actor, would be merely melodramatic.One minor quibble is the beginning and ending scenes, which were completely out of step with the 'buddy buddy' feeling that permeated this movie. While the resolution does tie up all the loose ends, it just makes it so...flat. But it's a minor quibble nonetheless.The plot itself is paced well, the actors are brilliant, the script is sharp and honest, the gore is substantiated and not overdone, so what's stopping you from watching this movie?</fullReview>

All was more decently done in "Band of Brothers". Only the action of the German flak-crew and SP-gun was done well.

		<fullReview>I didn't like this one. People seem to fall for Spielberg's direction, which is very good with the exception of some big mistakes (see below). But the story is so bad.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!First of all: how can the old man at the beach remember things, he never saw? I mean he did not participate in the landing, how on earth he can remember it so vividly?Second: Question: In the end: the bridge is set with explosives, a tank is hit by a bomb from a fighter plane and a man is on that bridge directly in front of the tank. What happens to him? According to Spielberg / Rodat: Nothing! The tank is destroyed, the bridge is not, and there is not shrapnel at all - and the man is still in one piece!! Come on, you people, you call THIS realistic?!Third: Monty-bashing is okay IMO (see MarketGarden), but how come that Hanks, who is just a Captain, is more aware of the general situation than higher ranking officers with all the information they are getting from other troops, planes etc.? I am referring to the scene on the beach, when Hanks is telling us about the importance of this particulare bridge. Which turns out to be very small, nothing pioneers could not build over night. It's not like crossing the Rhine! But Hanks claims, that this bridge is not only vital for the success of D-Day, but the entire war!! This is crap beyond imagination! Thank you Mr. Rodat, you made us all believe that every soldier in every thick of a fight can judge better than a General!Four: The change of Hanks. He is trying to come out alive, he even tries to save his men's lifes. Wandering around in France he happens to hit a lonely German outpost with a machine gun. Question: What is the right decision? Correct! You run directly into the line of fire... Well, he could have said: "Men, do you want to walk around it, could be, say, a mile to avoid it...?!" Soldier: "No, my script says, I have to die here, so let's run into it!" Hanks: "Ah, you are right! And there will be also a German soldier who has to beg for his life, and I have to have mercy on him, so he will be able to run and fight us again later. Hmm, that shows pretty well the evilness of the Germans. Okay, so let's run!"Five: The change of Hanks. So he has lost a man. Now he's going for it: "Let's call this bridge !The Alamo!. This is were we will fall back to." Soldier: "Hmm, I don't remember exactly: What happened to the defenders of that place in Mexico, uh, Texas...?" Hanks: "Uh, any OTHER questions...?"Six: The final battle. Well though the SS was being an elite troop at the beginning of the war, it was watered down by 1944. But they were fanatics and/or thugs/killers/low-lifes/scum - you get the idea! - from about 16 countries at this time. There were even French, Norwegian, Swedish, Ukrainian soldiers - you name it - in the German army at this time. All in all we can consider them to be very dangerous. Maybe this particulare troop had some veterans from the eastern front. This is an armored infantry, bringing along tanks. And now enter Hanks an Co. They decide to shoot it out and - guess by yourself what happens....Seven: The characters. Don't get me started on that...Dear Mr. Spielberg, you are great, but you have to have more patience looking for good scripts. You did cinema history with the opening sequence, but the rest just sucks - due to the script.Dear Mr. Rodat, maybe the original script was better than this mess, maybe I am doing you wrong. But on the other hand, your next script was "The patriot". The one with Gibson, not Seagal...well, you'll keep trying, huh?!The movie was in the Top 10 (if I remember right), and now it's down on 58. But the users of IMDb comment on it enthusiastically. I guess the the ones who did not like it, did not comment?Bad, bad writing, good directing, good Hanks 4/10 Macaulay J. Connor</fullReview>

One guy lost his arm in the war and searched for it hoping they could help him with his arm again. Then he walked around with his arm in his hand.Too much shooting, but what do I expect from a war movie? I've always disliked movies about war.

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest War Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1999) **** Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, Paul Giamatti, Harve Parsnell, Bryan Cranston, David Wohl, Joerg Standler, Leland Orser, Harrison Young. Steven Spielberg's epic scopic vision set in WWII emerses you from its grueling opening 25 minutes of you-are-there depiction of the battle of Omaha Beach, Normandy during D-Day grippingly depicts hell on earth with all its graphic carnage that is relentless in its harrowing approach only underscores the unfolding plot of saving one man's life: a true metaphor never ringing hollow. Hanks gives another patented beautiful performance as Capt. John Miller, the dispatched leader of an Army Rangers squad to find Pvt. James Ryan (Damon), the sole living son after his three active duty siblings are killed during battle. Leading what would only be called a Hollywood stereotypical troop of outspoken, griping Brooklynite Mick (Burns); built-to-kill Italian grunt who's writing a letter home (Diesel); gospel-spouting Southern sharpshooter (Pepper, a nice stand-out to root for); the token walking-conscience Jew (Goldberg); the medic with a heart of gold (Ribisi also excellent); and the never-seen-combat interpreter/journalist (Davies, ditto). The script by Robert Rodat, who incorporates the true life accounts of The Fighting Sullivans, who all perished at war, makes compelling characters come to life and one gets the sense of really pulling for these men on a literal look for a 'needle in a stack of needles'. Like 'Schindler's List' the film stands on its own; only this case instead of saving hundreds of lives, the precious gift of one only permeates the universal message: all life is precious, even if it seems fruitless for 8 men to sacrifice for it. Hanks clearly gives the film its soul with an incredibly nuanced turn as a school teacher on the frontline clearly feeling the end may be near given his ever exapanding right hand tic and his only hope of seeing his beloved wife stateside again on a mission as desperate as the bigger picture ('winning the war'). Spielberg outdoes himself by making arguably the most realistic and least sensationalistic war film ever made and that's saying something with the polemics of 'Platoon' and surreal imagery of 'Apocalypse Now' still reverberating the echoes of The War Film. Brilliantly filmed by Spielberg collaborator/cinematographer wunderkind Janusz Kaminksi, the camera suitably goes terror-laden trenches with its documentarian air about it and slightly grainy, yet gorgeous photography. The violence may be the hardest element to stomach but in light of its subject matter it certainly is not inappropriate; one will never actually feel what living in a war is like unless having fought one. Spielberg and company should be proud for its authenticity. Also of note: Dale Dye, a longtime military film adviser/actor (he has a cameo during the planned rescue debriefing), prepped the actors with rigorous boot camp training that clearly pays off. Arguably one of the best films ever made and ultimately cheated of Best Picture (losing out to - oh PLEASE! - 'Shakespeare in Love') but scored 5 Academy Awards including the deserved Best Director for Spielberg, Kaminski for Best Cinematography, Editing, Sound Effects and Sound Effects Editing.</fullReview>

On the contrary, the plot is quite anonymous, there's not a great psychological introspection of most characters, too much patriotism made-in-USA. I think the author tries to cover the structural weakness of the plot with many "hard" scenes, you know what I mean. Compared to another "war-movie", produced more or less in the same period (I think the name, in english, should be "the sharp red line") but with considerably less money, this movie, in one word, can be distinguished for its mediocrity, typical of most great Hollywood's productions.</fullReview>

A plot with the artful fascist by fast run made a circle around of heroic group and join to german army ON ANOTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE (probably he knew shorter way and having crossed the river, has changed clothes, has shaved and again pitch in fight for Furer!!!) it is simple matchless.Simply remains bitterness for good director sunk in own pathos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another typical Hollywood war-pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, those first 20 minutes make Hollywood history. Absolutely harrowing, heart-rending stuff. But after that, Saving Private Ryan just slumps into old-fashioned Dirty Dozen-like stuff. Just another Hollywood war pic, yawwwnnnnn. Every ten minutes or so a member of brave Tom Hanks' little setup gets killed, but I found myself absolutely not caring about these characters. The reason being that there had been no character portrayal at all... and when you don't feel you KNOW a movie character, you cannot empathize with him either. Just more cannon fodder, that's all. The ending of the movie is even more grossly sentimental than the one in Schindler's List. Simply awful. I strongly urge everyone to LEAVE the cinema of switch off the video before that! If this movie was all about showing the futility of war, and the terrible waste of human life, it is inferior by far to Apocalypse Now or Das Boot. Yes, sure, we Europeans are grateful to the immense sacrifices that Americans, Canadians and others brought for our freedom. But does that mean we have to sit through these awful movies, as some sort of penance?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is probably the war movie that received too much hype in the media to be still seen without prejudices. From my perspective, however, it was neither a good movie nor a particularly intelligent new look on WWII, but part of my resentment against the film results from my different cultural background, in which such an open nationalistic display of national images (the American flag waving full-screen for opening and closing) is found disturbing.It's surprising that so many people think that this film sheds a new surprising light on D-Day or WWII. If someone needed the bloody and gory opening sequence about D-Day to realize that war is hell, then this person has never thought about war in the first place. Of course war is a horrible experience, but it's amazing how many people needed Mr. Spielberg to tell them. And Spielberg does not solely concentrate on the horrors of war. Like so many other American war films, be it WWII or Vietnam, the heroic suffering is always endured by the brave innocent American side. The fact that the opposing side might also not have enjoyed the fighting is always overlooked.The much praised historical accuracy, for me, does not rate this movie above others--if I want to know facts about WWII, I'll look them up in a history book, and not buy a movie ticket.What additionally annoyed me was the bad directing. The lame attempt at a bit of comic relief with the wrong Private James Ryan was totally out of place in a serious war film. Tom Hanks got another chance to play the perfect American mainstream man, and Spielberg did not bother to properly develop his character into a three-dimensional person with highs and lows. Further, the overly patriotic ending destroyed all attempts to make it an anti-war movie.Despite of all the glorifying reviews in the newspapers and magazines, it's just another war movie, nothing new or different from anything already seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do filmmakers feel like they must manipulate viewers so?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this film, I had heard only positive feedback. I went into it expecting great things. And I guess, yes, it was a good film. The action sequences are awesome--very realistic. The fighting scenes are incredibly moving and (as far as I can tell, I wasn't there) authentic. But, geez, what was with the beginning and the end? It would have been a great film without those shmaltzy sequences. Do we really need the director to SHOW us just how much of an impact Captain John had on Private Ryan? Can't anything be left to the imagination?This film reminds me of Forrest Gump in its (blatant) manipulation of the viewing public. My plea to directors is let us watch and judge the merits of the characters, don't tell us he's everyman, so then we will melt, cry and react emotionally! We are smarter than you think. Really! We will get it without the affectations and overt pulls at the heartstrings. What ever happened to subtlety in film? I am sorry for those of you who think this is the best film you've ever seen. Watch a few more movies before you make such comments. Or maybe, just learn to watch what you do watch more critically. Don't let yourselves be manipulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cinematography doesn't make up for a bad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the first twenty minutes, (discounting the first scene in the cemetary), were mindblowing. The handheld visuals gave a sense of realism, and was true, honest filmaking. Spielberg should have stopped there. After the Normandy scene, we are introduced to the characters that will guide the audience on its long trip to nowhere. I hesitate to call them characters, as they are cardboard cutouts designed to fool the audience into believing there was any depth to them. They didn't fool me. They are a bunch of stereotypes, thrown together in a group, and sent on a quest. Unfortunately, Robert Rodat lacked the storytelling skills to make the film anything more than a failure with astounding visuals.It seemed as though he threw random scenes together and decided to call it a script. I've heard this film be referred to, interestingly enough, as both a pro-war film, and an anti-war film. The reason there is such confusion, is because neither Robert Rodat, nor Steven Spielberg could make up their minds. The first twenty minutes seem to say one thing, where as the last twenty say another. In between, everything is just drivel. Because of the conflict in ideas, (and for numerous other reasons), the film lacked focus. It had no sense of itself, and was not well-realized at all. It was put in all directions and no directions at once&gt;Saving Private Ryan, apart from being a failure, was also an insult to my intelligence. It was so sugar-coated, it made me sick. A movie like this should go down hard, and leave a bitter taste in your mouth afterwards. However, Spielberg, for some reason, felt the need to apologize for the film's graphic depictments of battle with an ending that tried to hard to explain itself. Spielberg may as well have run up in front of the screen at the end of the movie, and said, "In case you didn't understand the other two-and-a-half hours of this film, allow to me to explain what just happened..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Hollywood movie; but not such a great War movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half hour of this movie blew me away. I couldn't comprehend how a movie could put so much realism.It wasn't until the conflict of "Saving Private Ryan" that I became a little disappointed; because at this point, we move out of Europe to a little town called Tinstletown.The problem I have with this movie is that people accept this movie as a documentation. Is this a true war story? I think its more of a true patriotic idealistic propaganda. So here's the lay out: hundred and thousands of men go to war to "save their country;" this part is good. Yet out of a midst of war, would the government really save a soldier for the spite of the mother? 3 of her sons die; but it's supposed to be ok because they "laid their lives down for their country (at least this is supposed to be the theme of the movie)." So what's wrong with the forth son; he's doing the same. It contradicts the theme. Secondly, what about every other soldier; they all have mothers, families, &amp; pregnant wives, too. It just doesn't happen that way. Thirdly, one woman wouldn't recognize that 3 brothers died out of thousands of deaths she's writing up; and she wouldn't ask a man to save the 4th son with him executing it. "Ryan" welcome to Hollywood.The movie as a movie is good. It is excellent. But its nothing more or nothing truer than what actually did happen to these soldiers in war. I've noticed many people I've discussed this movie to, take this movie so literally that it makes me agitated. Sometimes the only way we like to deal with war is to believe some of the things we see; that it was good to save Ryan by killing the enemy, that war means so much patriotism. But this is just one aspect; it isn't the embodiment of war. There are too many other things that war has to tell. (Oliver Stone made a trilogy based on 3 different sides/aspects about war).I know some men who fought in war. They watched the movie shocked by the first half hour, they were literally sweating. The next moment they were thinking and remembering their time in war. They all thought the storyline was a bit dreamy. And the response I got was this: "I don't recall anyone who was like Tom Hanks. We were all Matt Damon's, who didn't know between right from wrong."I mean at the end of the movie when old Private Ryan goes "was it worth it?" The camera starts showing his loving wife, his children and grand children (by the way . . . what was up with the big chested triplets?) and of course the audience is going to be all teary eyed "yes it was worth it." Come on 10 other individuals could have been alive if it weren't for him, but I forgot, we need patriotism in these movies. I'd suggest anyone to read books on war, by people who've been there, like Tim O'Brien, because those books actually make you think.As a Hollywood movie, I give this movie 9/10; But as a true war movie, I give this 6/10; the first half hour "10/10"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Spielberg melodrama. Yawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I don't like being manipulated and constantly being told what to feel, and Spielberg ALWAYS does this in his "serious" films. He should stick to light-hearted adventure stories, at which he is very good.The opening and closing cemetery scenes were heavy-handed. The subject matter doesn't need flag-waving, Steven, we get the point without you rubbing our faces in it.The opening battle scene is very well done, except it's voyeuristic and even pornographic. I saw the reaction of the kids in the front row and they were getting off on the blood and gore, just like in a video game. I think Malick's filming of the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line was much more effective -- it puts you in the midst of the grass, fire, smoke, concussive explosions and total chaos and is quite unnerving. Should've gotten the Best Cinematography Oscar.I cringed at Hanks' line "Earn this". Again, Spielberg seems to think we can't get such insights on our own without them being crammed down our throats. It's insulting. To have Hanks speak that line implies an insult to Damon's character, too.The line,"Tell me I was a good man" is just awful script-writing. Groan.Let's see, how can I put this without giving away the plot and therefore having this review banned? Okay, I thought it was really sophomoric to have the German POW that "X" (a main American character who shall remain unnamed) turned loose be the one to kill "X" in the end -- the odds against such a turn of events actually happening were quite overwhelming. To put that in the script was an "in your face" attempt at irony, right out of a bad film school project.I was mostly disappointed with what could have been a fine film if the director had not done what he always does -- practice overkill and leave nothing to the imagination, underestimating his audience, and propagandizing.I also think it's offensive to make a "Good Yanks, Bad Krauts" film. My uncles who fought against the German army knew better. This war, contrary to those who want to rewrite history to make it pretty, was about property, not saving the Jews nor stopping fascism (except when fascism threatened other people's property). Nazism was tolerated and even approved of in Britain, France and the U. S. before Hitler invaded France, and Britain and the U. S. turned away Jewish refugees from Hitlerism even after the start of the war. The Americans didn't enter the war to stop Hitler, they made huge profits from it till 1941, and only entered it when the Japanese made it impossible for them to stay out of it. This film's ideology pretends otherwise.Malick's film is much more accurate and, therefore, much less popular. Based faithfully on the novel by James Jones (who fought in Guadalcanal), it doesn't use war as a way to make people feel good, it tells the truth about war and those who fight in it, not disparagingly but realistically. I care about its characters, because they are believable, not caricatures like those in Private Ryan. The Thin Red Line is all the more uplifting because of its realism, and more enduring.For those, by the way, who keep writing that we who prefer The Thin Red Line are "pseudo-intellectual", I think they really mean that they themselves are anti-intellectual, a popular stance in the U. S. these days.From a friend in Canada, where unlike most of you in the States, we take ourselves and our mythologies with a healthy grain of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lousy script and blatant Oscar begging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's WW2 epic has often been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made, but unfortunately an awful script hampered the brilliant performances, superb direction and the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed. A scripted was riddled with clichés and American jingoism from the start that completely marred the film and did not move me at all. It was also the most blatant attempt at Oscar begging in the history of cinema, so much so that it would have been far subtler for the entire cast and crew to spend the entire running time on their knees and plead with the Academy to give them the awards! Hank's "I don't know anything about Ryan speech" had Best Actor Nomination Clip written all over it. Damon's "I'm trying to picture my brothers" talk was his bid to make up for last year's disappointment for "Good Will Hunting". The jerky photography, which was little, more than a strain on the eyes, wrapped up Best Cinematography Oscar. The fact that the film lost out on the big night to "Shakespeare in Love" (itself ludicrously over awarded) gave Speilberg his comeuppance. The characters to were stereotyped and cardboard and spoke utterly contrived dialogue. There's ALWAYS a religious one, Jew, an Italian, and a New Yorker, a tough sergeant and a rookie. Even Hanks (who really should think of going back to comedy films) played himself as the nice paternal figure. The film also gave out the message that the Americans won the war. There was not a single other allied soldier in the film. Not a problem on its own as Omaha was an all American landing spot, but what was unforgivable was that General Montgomery was slammed as "overrated". That was totally uncalled for and completely out of place in the situation. SPR was merely Speilberg exercising his greatest flaw that of recycling the same concept over and over again. SPR was in the same vain as "Amistad" and "Schlindler's List": that of showing the world the pain and suffering that a particular group of people went through and getting acclaim for it. The concept is wearing rather thin now Steven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That so many retaliatory comments have flown along the lines of 'What's wrong with being patriotic?' and 'kiss my red and white striped ...' it seems perhaps the whole point of war films has been missed.Truly great war films transcend such heroic, staunch patriotism to deliver the message that war sucks. This film has been praised for its true portrayal of war, yet from veterans I've had contact with, their sentiments were that war was a nightmare for everyone - that they were all just men/boys in hell - despite whom they had sworn any allegiance to.And so many young people I've spoken to left this film with the thoughts 'thank god we were fighting alongside America' and that Germans were demonized. At the same time people are claiming that this film should be shown to all school children. Yet what message does the film send exactly? True - the first half hour is a brilliantly harrowing piece of cinema, which managed to brutally show the ugliness of war better than any film beforehand. Yet I feel a great war film should ignore patriotism and concentrate on how war debases humans of ALL nationalities, and indeed that war transcends these other superficial divisions.A good film? Yes. The greatest war film? Not on my top 5 - I'm inclined to lean towards Das Boot - true-to-history graphic brutality isn't everything.</fullReview>

The basis is formed by a layer of american chauvinism, on which lies cheap, californian intellectualism, and the top is formed by multi-million dollars of special effects. The movie is pretentious and hollow, and commercial in the way that it pushes a couple of the buttons of turn-of-the-century american obsessions: family values, fear of the chaos of life and violence. It's quite understanding therefore that so many americans regard it as a good movie, as it strengthens emotions already there, instead of disrupting the mind, as any art should (in my opinion). As a war movie, it's mediocre. The agony of war is captured much better in films like Full Metal Jacket, Stalingrad and Das Boot. The sad thing is that it is the nationalism that is promoted in this movie (the whole movie is framed by a waving flag) that is so often the cause of wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious, as a time and a place where (mostly good-looking) young men can prove how brave they are. SPR would be different, so I expected. In this movie Spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific, not heroic.The first half hour of the movie really was shattering. People who still believe war is an exciting event for young would-be heroes (think: Tom Cruise in Top Gun) should be obligated to watch the Omaha Beach landing-scenes. Because it really makes you experience that war is hell, a sickening, horrible hell.Of course you can't fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the Omaha Beach landing. To make a good movie, you need more, like good actors, a capable crew, convincing special effects and, the most important, an interesting story. Well, no one will dispute the fact that SPR technically is a masterpiece. The camerawork, the special effects, the sound, they are all overwhelmingly good.In spite of all these plusses, I really was disappointed by at least two hours of SPR. Because it missed the most important thing a movie needs: an interesting story! The characters weren't convincing. I don't blame the actors for that, they all did a good job. It was the script that I blame, I never forgot I was watching a movie with made-up characters. When a movie is really good, I tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me, that I start to symphatize deeply with them. This never happened while I was watching SPR. I never felt anything more for Captain Miller and his men then I felt for all the other, anonymous soldiers you see in this movie. And the story, the search for Private Ryan, even bored me sometimes. There were just a few scenes, like the one in which the men were reading the name-tags of the fallen soldiers, that were really compelling.Three things about SPR I really disliked. First there is the way the German soldier known as "Steamboat Willie" was portrayed. Why is the only German we got to know a little bit such an awkward, silly guy? I'm pretty sure lots of German soldiers were ordinary men who didn't want this war any more then anyone else did. They must have been just as afraid as the American soldiers, they must have felt the same pain and horror. But that's not the way if feels like in SPR. The overall feeling you get is "Americans are good" and "Germans are bad". Second, there is the fight for the bridge. This kind of stuff, the brave heroes who, against all odds, succeed in defeating the enemy, well, this has been done so many times before. This kind of cliche was exactly what I expected SPR to avoid. Third, there is the 'point of view'. You are made to believe that the Omaha Beach-scenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard. Then, in the last scene, you learn that this man never set foot on Omaha Beach. I felt manipulated in a negative way!It was very hard for me to grade SPR. Technically, it's an absolute 10. The Omaha Beach-scene was extremely good, and I think it's a real homage to the veterans who were there. But there were too many things I did not like. I decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

I admit that the 20 min scene of the battle at Omaha Beach is a technical tour de force, however the rest of the movie suffers from mushy appeals to our sense of national pride and does not effectively construct thorough character studies. I believe it pales in comparison to The Thin Red Line, a movie which I believe has not received its due respect. I think it is unfortunate for Malick that the timing of this movie forces such absurd comparison to Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not overly impressed on the whole...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of reviewers and people I have spoken to have described this film as the greatest war film ever. It is far from this. Whilst I will concede that this film contains some of the most brutal and compelling war scenes I have witnessed in any film it is underpinned by a weak storyline and laughable script.Spielberg's camera direction is stunning and once again proves that he is a master of white-knuckle, tense action sequences but as is all too often the case with his flawed genius he feels the need to drown us in corny, unbelievable sentiment.The sheer, graphic horror of warfare is captured with thrilling camera work and editing and seemed to send many stomachs churning amongst fellow cinema goers. However inbetween the brutal and gory warfare we were expected to swallow sentiment of a level that upset my stomach far more.The scene where Hanks 'opens up' to the troops had me retching uncontrollably.Worse still was the nationalistic theme of the film. Spielberg had his "Isn't the USA great" hat on and he was wearing it proud.In summary this film though touched by genius was too long, too sickly-sentimental, too USA glorifying and on the whole too poorly written to ever be a film worthy of the superlatives that so many have bestowed upon it.Worth a look though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FOR WAR CONSIDERATION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>January 15, 1999 - Stephen Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN seems the stuff of greatness: it elevates cinematic realism to new heights, is a catalyst for passionate discourse on World War II, emboldens new respect for our veterans, and gives Spielberg an early lock on all things Oscar. Conversely, Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE garners equal parts praise, equal parts derision, and is called the product of an expatriate flower-child who's clearly lost his mind. Four days after seeing Malick's film, I am haunted, not by horrible images of war, but something far deeper and beguiling. Seeking truth, I see "Ryan" again, feeling diplomatic and ready to accept each film as two sides of the same coin - SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the Id, flesh, machination, mission, answer and nostalgic history, to THE THIN RED LINE's conscience, spirit, garden, journey, question, and utopian vision.Right out the gate, Spielberg is onto something big when he stages the battle of Omaha Beach. Consider that he arrives on location with only five pages of script for the entire invasion of Normandy, then gets busy in his sandbox, re-shooting and fine-tuning the gore until an immaculate vision of carnage is rendered - mostly thanks to Janusz Kaminski stripped lenses and newsreel cinematography. Reading the U.S. Army's technocratic account of D-Day, one is spirited to learn there is a real-life rifle company that lands at Dog Green amidst slaughter and confusion, blows a gap in a mine-field, fights its way to the top of a bluff, and cleans out a machine-gun nest. This incursion actually takes several grueling hours, not twenty minutes - that this should be surprising is testament to the power of Spielberg's false realism.That Spielberg didn't just tell the whole story of D-Day is a bit of a shame. I suppose he didn't want to remake THE LONGEST DAY (1962), with its ham-and-cheese heroics. I kind of wish he had. Instead, he opts for something more sentimental and personal in scope, but sadly, his vision suffers for it. The very moment Tom Hanks' "Captain Miller" looks back at a beach littered with corpses (body parts curiously absent) the film loses its well-crafted, objectivity. That the eviscerating horrors of the battle still weigh on the mind is no excuse for the parade of stock characters, inappropriate comic relief, and desperate pastiche that follow.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is no rip-off of THE THIN RED LINE, more so, an inversion. "Red Line's" single, gripping battle scene is bordered by metaphysical yearning, while "Ryan" bookends its uneasy spirituality with two scenes of sensational combat. "Red Line" features the hypnotic and ferocious presence of a green jungle, where "Ryan's" palate is leached of all color, save mud, gun-metal and brick. "Red Line" poses unanswerable queries into the nature of human existence, while "Ryan" asks the rhetorical question, "am I a good man?"All attempts at anticipating Malick's opus would be denied, for up to the second of his film's release, he still worked on it. Here is a man who will never play by Hollywood's rules. Consider that Malick spends twenty years in hiding, is begged out of retirement by a pair of iconoclastic producers (Robert Michael Geisler and John Roberdeau), spends many more years adapting James Jones' novel in secrecy, fires his producers, arrives on location in the wildernesses of Australia and the Solomon Islands with a small army, ditches his script, shoots 1,000,000 feet of 70mm film over a six-month period - most exclusively in evening and early morning light - cuts the film at eight hours, and lastly, writes a haunting, poetic narration to bind the final, three-hour cut.Those not hypnotized by Malick's vision are finding this film infuriating, though. A common complaint is that the film lacks a central hero to rally behind; but such is the film's belief that there exists a collective unconscious shared by all, and all men are somehow the same. The physical similarities between Privates "Witt" (Jim Cazeviel) and "Bell" (Ben Chaplin) emphasize this point. Both men carry with them memories of a great love, be it sensual wife, or primal paradise; both pass through war never to return to this love. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN you hear about a soldier's mental island, where one must go in battle to remain sane; but in THE THIN RED LINE, you experience this, and you mourn its passing.In the end, THE THIN RED LINE is about World War II as much as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is about Death, the dark, senseless way one is mutilated through war. THE THIN RED LINE is about Life, light, and its fragile presence in all living things.In conclusion, I must address which film and which director will carry home more Oscars? The Academy faced a similar conundrum in 1978 when considering COMING HOME vs. THE DEER HUNTER for Best Picture. (This was the same year Malick made Days of Heaven, then disappeared). The war in Vietnam, long a taboo subject, was then recognized in mainstream cinema but, who had the supreme vision, Hal Ashby or Michael Cimino? The question is superfluous for neither film is about the war so much as the disintegration of the American psyche. Ultimately, The Academy chose THE DEER HUNTER with its deeply layered character studies over the cloying, P.C. sentimentality of COMING HOME. I am hoping that today's voters are of a similar sensibility. Therefore, I most humbly suggest to the esteemed members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for your consideration, for Best Picture? THE THIN RED LINE - not because it is the better representation of war, because it is the greater realization of life.*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in spite of memorable combat scenes, liberal sentiment cheapens collective tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smug liberal Spielberg toggles back and forth between documentary style violence and sentimental reflections between soldiers: the Captain is revealed to be an English Lit teacher in civilian life who can instruct the novice writer character and others with idealised rhetoric about both the unique contribution each can make to the mission as well as their ability to choose at will a vision/memory of "the good life" back home worth fighting for: this emphasis upon individual freedom detracts from shared debate among the men about both the worthiness of the mission to save one guy, and the larger reasons for American involvement in the war. This deflates any anti- war sentiment in the film. Significantly, Ryan is the sole survivor who must, alone in the cemetery (predictably, his accompanying family are as silent as his fallen comrades), decide/hope he was "a good man" worthy of their sacrifice. In this emotional lynchpin of the movie, Spielberg suggestively cuts to Old Glory flapping in the wind: the link drawn between liberal pluralism/individual choice and the symbol of America remains an insidious and powerful ideological moment, equalled only by the title character in "Schindler's List" who had the power to choose who would live or die. Consistently in his historical revisionist pieces, Spielberg suggests this is the only kind of freedom worth fighting for, with no awareness of how it merely compounds the tragedy.</fullReview>

I suppose, but nothing that Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and a host of others don't have... this is just another one of those attempted "ground-breakers" which will be copied by everyone. Believe me, shortly people will be saying "Saving Private Who?". If you want to have quivering body parts and open wounds, watch any of a host of horror movies from about the 1950's on. Tom Hanks for an Oscar? You have to be kidding. Forrest Gump was a better role. The man has next to no personality in this role, and his portrayal doesn't help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from an utterly brilliant opening sequence (the landing on Omaha beach), this movie is basically old wine in a new bottle.Spielberg flirts with the idea of realism (yes, kiddies, war isn't fun after all) and the pointlessness of war, but at the end, we've got the same old "small number of outgunned Americans save the day with ridiculously obvious tactics" theme. Haven't these Germans heard of scouts?Also irritating is the fact that Spielberg sets us up for the mission to "Save Private Ryan" to be a ambiguous, even pointless affair, risking the lives of several men to save one, then suddenly loses the courage of his convictions: all of a sudden, we're fighting Germans in a strategically important battle. How convenient. "Just a dash of Catch-22, if you please..."Speaking as an Australian, I suspect that this film might come as more of a revelation to me if I too had been raised to think of war in terms of John Wayne and Rambo and the rest. Newsflash for the clueless: War wasn't fun even before Vietnam...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read the first ten comments I was shocked how easily the audience accepts everything it gets served by names like Spielberg. The only positive exception I saw is Mark Welch.When I saw the first 40 minutes I was really surprised how realistic Spielberg's pictures and the plot were. After they took the beach he produced just another one of those average "let 10 Americans beat the German army" movies.Why did it have to be a set-up like that: It was not just 200 infantrists + 10 tanks vs 20 GI's (of course none was black!), but the WaffenSS, the German elite troops, which had quite some fighting experience from Russia. It was the same plot than hundreds before. Let the idiots take the main road, we attack from the sides.What would have happened: - the church tower would have been blown up before any Germans would have entered the town, as snipers are not that new - a small group of German soldiers would have checked the town - ...So, I probably saw 2 movies on the same day, the best and the worst war movie of the year. It doesn't surprise me, that the good part, was just a visually great set-up of a fixed plot, whereas when Spielberg was writing the story, it turned out to be worst rubbish. If you want to see a good war movie, take Full Metal Jacket, or Platoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great battle scenes, but somewhat spoiled by many flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about SPR is the Omaha Beach sequence. That was very realistic, as well as being factual. The rest of the story is fictional, only somewhat realistic, and rather unlikely. First of all, the WWII US Army would never have wasted a Ranger Captain who was a company commander to lead a SQUAD of soldiers. They would have assigned a platoon sergeant, or at most a 2nd Lieutenant. I can believe they might send a squad of regular infantry to find a single soldier, but using Rangers is a stretch. Rangers are more highly trained, and would be used for an important military objective, not a "P.R. mission". There were some touches that I liked. I liked the way Tom Hanks portrayed Captain Miller as a normal guy who's approaching burnout, and is starting to get the "shakes". Also the way he kept a certain amount of distance from his men until they were down to a small group. The part about the company having a "pool" on his prewar occupation, and it turning out to be a teacher. The way the sniper, Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), quotes Scripture to calm himself and steady his aim. The running "FUBAR" joke. However, the end really bothers me. Having Captain Miller laying a heavy guilt trip on Private Ryan (Matt Damon), as he dies is unrealistic melodrama. Finally, much has been said about various 'tactical errors' made by both the German and American forces in the movie's climactic battle. Steven Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics for dramatic effect. Shame on you, Steven! Neither Robert Rodat (writer) nor Steven Spielberg (director) have ever served in the military. In fact, Spielberg attended California State University, Long Beach, to avoid the draft for the Vietnam War. So this is the kind of UNREALISTIC war movie made by someone who went to college to avoid military service. I don't think it helped that Robert Roden had to rewrite the screenplay 11 times before it was accepted.In the words of Sam Fuller, "The only way to make a truly realistic war movie is to fill the theater with smoke and flame, the sound of explosions, and to have someone shoot the person sitting next to you." Amen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It's an unbelievably emotionally powerful film that inspires a horror seldom seen in the usual Hollywood movie. This has to be not only one of the greatest war movies ever made, but possibly THE greatest movie ever ever made. I would easily put it on the level of the Godfather movies. Why? SPR has infinite character depth. There are no GI Joes or murderous killers that every single war movie needs to have. Every soldier is just that - a soldier. I may also be one of the few who felt sorry for Upham. Keep in mind that he wasn't a soldier per se. He was an interpreter. Also, keep in mind that he hadn't really established a bond with the unit yet, which was something that they all shared.SPR has a realistic portrayal of WWII. They even portrayed the Germans and SS better than any movie I have ever seen. It also forces you to feel sorry for soldiers of both sides, like when the two American soldiers shot the two Czechs (I believe, as mentioned on the forum) who surrendered, and then taunted them. This was a subtlety that I only recently found out about. I always assumed that they were German.Tom Hank's character was truly great. He wasn't a stock character at all, and seemed like he could be a real person. This was actually true for all of the characters. I also, guiltily, felt a little sorry for Steam Boat Willie, who was probably going to be executed in a ditch for being the sole survivor of, you know. You know what happens in the final scene, and I couldn't feel sorry for him anymore, and was happy, as we all were, when the event after that happened. This was just one of the many amazing themes and subtleties that were involved with this movie. I have seen it over 15 times, and still notice new things every time.In conclusion, this movie is gruesome but beautiful. What greater present for Veterans Day is there than to watch this movie? They truly were the greatest Generation, and their gift of freedom to us keeps on giving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a mother that is about to be notified that three of her four sons have been killed in a war. The fourth son is not known to alive nor dead. Eight men begin a journey to find and bring the fourth son home to his mother. Throughout this journey you are taken to the war at that specific time. This movie shows what the war was truly like and helps people who have never suffered through a war really look and reflect on their life. This movie shows the extent to which a government will go to, to simply ease a mother's pain.Another wonderful aspect of this movie is that when the fourth son is finally found and is informed of his brothers death he wants to continue with his mission that was set before him. He feels his brothers deaths would have been in vain if he does not complete his mission. Therefore the eight soldiers aid in in attempting his mission before returning home. This is another important aspect of the movie as it shows that most soldiers are there for a reason and believe in the cause they are fighting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is one one of Spielberg's best movies, and that's saying a lot. It was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense, graphic, and completely realistic. It is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever. It was a great beginning to an incredible movie.Tom Hanks plays Captain John H. Miller. After surviving the attack at Omaha Beach (known now as D-Day) he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private Ryan and bring him back home. You see, all of Ryan's brothers have been killed in combat, and since he is the last survivor, the higher ups in the U.S. military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boys.Miller of course takes the job. He doesn't much like it, but he is just following the orders of his superiors. When he tells his platoon about it, they are all against it. After all, why should they risk all their lives for one person. They gripe about it, but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines where Ryan's squadron was parachuted in.Along the way we learn about the characters, yet the pace never was drawn out. As the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters. Vin Diesel had and early roll with this movie, and other actors include Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish, and Henry Thomas. All were good in their roles.This movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound. It was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these, and I also believe that Spielberg's Oscar for Best Director was the right choice. Tom Hanks was the main star, but Spielberg's directing made all the characters seem just as important, and kept the pace of the moving going without any real slow up.My only question would be about the story which is told form a soldier's view. I have know problem with the story being told from that view, but what I do have a problem with is believing that our leaders would create a mission that would risk eight of their men to save one. I know that the grieving mother lost three of her boys, but would our military really go through all this for one man? I don't think so. But then it is just a movie. Overall I enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it to anybody.</fullReview>

But it is thematically a mess, and on that count is wildly overrated.The complaints about this movie on these IMDb comments are two: one that it is properly speaking an anti-war film, and the other that it indulges in crude nationalism. Both complaints are on the mark, but it should be noticed that they are not quite consistent with one another. Saving Private Ryan, in the tradition of Vietnam movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, focuses on the human cost of war. But its moral, that we must earn the sacrifice those bold men made for us so long ago, sits rather uncomfortably with the focus on the cost. After all, how could we earn the loss of these men and the grief of their mothers? By living well? By being good people? It doesn't make sense. How could you make your life worth the sacrifice of so many others?Perhaps the point is that we ought to be grateful to the men who fought and died for saving our lives. But this doesn't make sense either. The war in Europe did not properly speaking save our lives. Wars are rarely if ever fought to save lives. They are fought to conquer and to defend against being conquered. But being conquered does not amount to being killed, and it might well save lives to surrender. Spielberg does obliquely refer to the Holocaust in the film. But he must know as everyone does that the war was not fought to end the Holocaust.Perhaps Spielberg is tacitly assuming some flag-waving boilerplate about how they fought 'for freedom', and we ought to be grateful for that. I don't deny that 'saving Europe for liberal democracy'?however we understand that--was a noble cause. But it would be impossible to tell from this movie that this was the point of the war, and it might well be impossible to believe that such a cause was worth dying for once you had properly taken in its message: that war is the senseless destruction of mothers' sons.War movies traditionally fall into two types. One type focuses on the heroic cause the soldiers fought for, in which case you will want to glorify war. You will want to make your soldiers look strong, noble, and make our hearts melt with admiration for them. Otherwise how can we encourage others to fight for such (often abstract) causes? Most classic WWII movies fit this mold. And given that most of us think WWII was fought for a good cause, this makes sense. The other alternative is to focus on the human cost of war, as Vietnam movies and WWI movies typically do. But it isn't a coincidence that Vietnam and WWI are thought to be pointless wars. The idea of such movies is that nationalism and social habits can lead us to sacrifice our children for nothing. By shocking us with the horror of war, we are encouraged to mistrust martial impulses. Saving Private Ryan tries to take from both traditions, and ends up with a garbled mess. WWII was a noble cause that could not have been worth the sacrifice. It might be argued that each type of movie neglects some important truth that the other type captures. Perhaps some great filmmaker will successfully ennoble the causes of war and at the same time capture its horror. Perhaps someone already has. All I know is that Spielberg has not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening sequence, is without doubt.1/ The most Harrowing and Horrific depiction of War that i have ever seen.2/ The Best Movie Sequence to test out your surround sound system that i've ever encountered.After learning that 3 out 4 of Mrs. Ryans Sons have all died in combat during various missions in World War II, It is decided that her last remaining son will not be allowed to die in battle, and a small group of soldiers is assembled to get Private Ryan out.Spielberg has undoubtedly captured the feel and the gloom of War, and has certainly avoided unnecessary Dramatisation. With a Top Class Cast, a Great Director and a Powerful Story, Saving Private Ryan is probably one of the finest movies ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and waaaayyyyy too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched that movie in the theaters shortly after its release and I was expecting something brilliant upon reading all the praises it was receiving. I couldn't be more mistaken.One of my biggest problem lies with the opening D-Day landing shoot-out and the way it is shown on-screen. Sure there is a lot of blood, graphical violence and flying body parts... But there's no direction whatsoever. It's "handheld camera" all along to make us think we're watching a documentary. Sadly we aren't and what we are watching (although it happened) is not the least believable. The rendition on-screen is absolutely laughable which it should not be. It goes over the top with the one soldier holding his cut-off arm with the hand that he's got left. I lost it at that point. It was up to the worst of horror movies. I really believe it would have a much more powerful sequence, had Spielberg done a real editing job, instead, Spielberg apparently decided that having guys running in front of his cameras being randomly blown away by fake explosions was the way to go. In short, the whole sequence is weak because of Spielberg careless work and it kills the film right there.And then there's the search for Ryan, the lack of character development, (sorry but the guessing game about Tom Hanks' character's real profession is no character development), the mandatory misidentification, the mandatory french tune (boy! there sure was only one record available in France at that time... long live stereotypes!), and the ending which I won't discuss here for I don't want to spoil it for people who might actually enjoy it. That picture is rather pedestrian and would have been better had the plot/character development been strengthened and at the same time been 30 minutes shorter.Two good things though one being the battle sequence in the devastated village (baring the dumb ending)...and guess what! Spielberg apparently found his way back to the editing room. At last! The second one being the acting which is remarkably solid and really saves the picture (and I'm no Tom Hanks' fan!).I will not go any longer for I think I have made my point.This movie is disappointing because of its numerous weaknesses (directing, plot, character development) and is therefore, in my opinion, terribly overrated. Once again, Spielberg fails to deliver when taking on a serious topic. 6 out of 10 overall.If you wish to see a great WW2 movie, go check Peckinpah's Cross of Iron for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best and most powerful war movie ever.Its been hailed as the best and most realistic war movie ever and it is.Thinking that war was this horrifying is unbelievable but it was like this and Saving Private Ryan shows it in every detail. This is one movie i would recommend for parents to show their kids. Kids need to know what war was really like. Instead of watching war movies where they portray it as bullet dodging - jumping through explosions fun. Overlooking the gore i think kids should watch it to understand and appreciate the war veterans more. It sure made me appreciate them more.The opening scene is one you will never forget. I am referring to the Ohama beach scene of course,which is the most powerful scene in the movie although it is the most graphic it still is a strong scene.After a mother loses all her sons except one. Eight men go behind enemy lines to save him and bring him back home to his mother. Guided by Captain John Miller the men journey into the heart of war and make it their mission to bring private Ryan home to his mother.Every actor did a great job. I was greatly surprised by Vin Diesal he did a nice performance. Tom Hanks was excellent and Matt Damon was good as private Ryan.I recommend this to everyone and i mean everyone if you don't have this movie i would run out and borrow it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest war film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was told excellently from director Steven Spieldberg. The whole experience was realistic. Tom Hanks was excellent as Captain John Miller, and I felt so sorry for his character in the end. Matt Damon was excellent as James Ryan, who is the main purpose of their mission. The whole cast does a great job playing the roles of Miller's men who are not sure about why they're risking their lives to save just one man.No other war movie except Schindlers List can capture the realness and realities of war on film with so much suspense, but Spieldberg has managed to do it. I commend him for his effort and great accomplishment that has reminded all of us to never forget the number of people who died for freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Battle Sequences in Otherwise Tepid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once the hype surrounding a Spielberg film proves accurate: the first half-hour of the film, which shows the WWII Allied invasion of Normandy, is every bit as powerful as you've heard, a knock-you-flat piece of film-making that surpasses every other cinematic image of war's hell. Unfortunately, D-Day as such has absolutely nothing to do with the story of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: once this brilliant sequence is over, we are left with a highly sentimental, tiresomely repetitive, and completely unoriginal film that drags on and on to an extremely obvious conclusion.The story concerns a young man (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in battle, leaving him as his parents' only surviving child. Top brass decide that Pvt. Ryan must be sent home--but they are not entirely sure where he is in war-torn Europe. Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is accordingly snatched up from the D-Day battle and along with a handful of men is sent to find Ryan and bring him back in one piece--and at this point the film pretty much comes to a grinding halt.Hanks once again proves why he is among Hollywood's most bankable stars: like James Stewart, he has an everyman quality sure to appeal to most viewers--but although he remains as likable as ever, the script really doesn't give Hanks much to work with, and neither he nor his co-stars are greatly memorable. Indeed, once the opening battle sequence ends the film becomes so slow and so repetitive that you could easily nip outside, cut the lawn, and come back in to find you've not missed anything at all. Final word? The opening battle scene is worth the movie, but don't think you're missing anything if you can't stay awake for the end.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIELBERG'S WORST FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overrated World War II drama, that somehow became a big hit, and won Spielberg his second Academy Award. The film starts and ends with two very realistic battle scenes, but what they put in the middle is meaningless and pointless; pure corn. I admire Spielberg the serious, older director, but somehow I miss the young director who made movies like E.T., Jaws, Duel and Raiders of the Lost Ark. His latter-day-work has lost that wonderful sense of wonder that made him so dear to movie buffs. Some of the action is very realist, but if I will only want realism, I would watch a documentary. I prefer the poetic and more powerful The Thin Red Line, a film that reminds me of the young Spielberg.</fullReview>

If I were the producer, the Normandy scene would be cut into 6 or 10 minutes. It will be a fair length for the movie. The plot was too much elaborated and empty. Anyway what is it that Tom Hanks' right hand dindle. Why did he tingle like that? Had the writer and the rest of staff forgotten this matter? Goofs!! but the production-works are marvelous.

		<shortDescription>What Shall We Do With Steven Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can doubt the power of this film's opening sequence. When Miller (Tom Hanks), slimed in blood and filth, stares blank eyed at the carnal slaughter around him , you cannot help but think 'That was what is was really like'. And you cannot help but reflect on the importance of this moment in modern history, and on the undiluted bravery of the men who were there. And yet....when the initial battle is over, Horvath (Tom Sizemore) scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it in to a tin marked 'France'. It's a moment of forced quirkiness, quite out of keeping with the frank reportage of what's gone before. It's a bit of business, used by the director as a punctuation mark, and it's the first sign that this is a film with fatal flaws.Having survived Omaha Beach, Miller and his men are assigned to locate Ryan, whose whereabouts are unknown. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and the US military brass cannot allow Ryan to be lost too. There's a historical precedent for this, although 'Saving Private Ryan' is a wholly fictionalised account. Given their mission, the soldiers debate it's worth - are they to throw their lives away in order to arbitrarily save someone else? Conflicts arise, there are uneasy stand offs, and reluctant truces. They find Ryan, and save him. Ryan lives to be a humble old man, but most of the soldiers who saved him do not live to be old men of any sort.Spielberg's technique is frequently brilliant, but it's unvaried, so that the final battle is no different in tone from the first one, three hours of screen time previous. But the real flaws are in the script. Miller is an ordinary decent man, who will make difficult decisions when pushed. Horvath is the tough sergeant, Wade is the medic disgusted by the slaughter, Reiben is the insubordinate, Mellish is the comedian who doesn't know when to shut up, Upham is the tenderfoot who's never fired a weapon on his life, Jackson is an illiterate from the deep south who's also crack shot, Carparzo is a giant of a man. Miller could be played by Gregory Peck, Horvath by Ernest Borgnine. Reiben might be a young William Holden and so on.The worst crime is the character of the German soldier who the men want to execute in revenge for the death of Wade. The German begs pitifully for his life, says in broken English that he loves America and hates Germany. Upham is a humanitarian, he can't stand to see a man killed in cold blood and he persuades Miller to let the German go free. Upham has never fired a weapon in his life, remember, and Miller is full of human decency. So at the end, what happens? The German returns, having thrown in his lot with another platoon of German soldiers. In what is portrayed as a supreme irony, the German kills Miller, and in turn, is killed by Upham, who finally finds his courage, or at least, his capacity to kill. The problem is that as soon as you set eyes on Upham, he's so weak and pathetic that it's a certainty his character will undergo a dramatic reversal. It doesn't matter that Tom Hanks as Miller, Jeremy Davies as Upham, and Barry Pepper as Jackson are superb. It doesn't matter that as vignettes, the deaths of Wade and Mellish are exceptional. Behind the throat clearing and the reverence, the clichés stretch from the flinty military hawk who gives the order that Ryan must be saved, to the final soft focus image of the older Ryan himself. In the end, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a more callow, less worldly film than 'Attack' or 'A Walk In The Sun' and the savagery of it's opening only serves to emphasise the fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did they get this script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have read any of my posts then you might have detected a slight pro-military bent. Then you probably think that I liked "Saving Private Ryan". Think again! It stank. I muted the first 20 minutes of the movie where they depict with gruesome relish the effects of concentrated machine gun fire and artillery explosions on the human body. I preferred spending my time reading a book to watching that. Once that carnage was over I was treated to typical foul language, but nothing I haven't heard in my tour of duty. That I could have forgiven. But what they did with the story-line was absolutely dreadful.Clearly the people who wrote this script have no sense when it comes to military behavior or military tactics. For instance, the troops were going to mutiny to the command decision by their captain to attack a machine gun nest. Well I would too with an IDI*T like Tom Hanks' character leading a charge in broad daylight directly into the line of fire of said machine gun. Even an English teacher turned captain would have more sense than that. Then they captured a German soldier. So what do they do with him? They blindfold him and tell him to walk 1000 paces before taking off the blindfold... Well what a surprise when he turns up later to fight against this squad and tortuously slowly impale one of squad soldiers with a bayonet. All while one of the squad cowers in fear while his fellow soldiers are getting massacred around him. What a nice way to depict the soldiers. Oh and then the same cowardly soldier somehow finds his courage in time to capture some German soldiers (including the previous released prisoner) This time however he "cold-bloodedly" shoots him (revenge?)... I won't even bore you with the stupid decision for a light infantry squad to hold a bridge (instead of blowing it) against several tanks &amp; armor with infantry support. It was a stupid movie and I am only feeling better now that I am able to give vent to my frustration at having watched it. I'm only glad that I didn't pay any money to watch this crud. I hate movies that blank me off when I watch them. THERE! 3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raising the bar for violence in movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although unintentionally, this movie is creating a new envelope for violent movies to push. The next movie that is made along the lines of Starship Troopers, which was only a notch behind in my view, will certainly rival Saving Private Ryan. In fact, I didn't find much difference between the two movies, save for how utterly pretentious Saving Private Ryan was. An all star cast that went completely unused throughout the entire movie. People often say that this is a movie with a message, a message of the utter horror of war. However, I personally prefer the delivery in such movies as All's Quiet on the Western Front, which relies on acting rather than a multi million dollar budget (was it that low?) used to create a gore fest. Frankly, I believe that most people won't get the message, and a lot of people will treat it as an action movie, say, "Hey cool, that guy's got no arm!", instead of being sick to their stomach, like they should be. I faced the same thing with Starship Troopers; the violence in the movie made me sick, but for most people, it was a joyride. Well, y'all had better get used to it, because thanks to this movie, there will be plenty more along those lines.</fullReview>

It is patriotic in the wrong way, till the point that makes one puke and sympathize with the Germans. 5. It demonizes and dehumanizes the Germans. 6. It is actually a very bad movie.As said, this is another rubbish film about the good Americans versus the evil Germans.The plot(if you may call it that) is so flawed and biased that i could not help it but sympathize strongly with the Germans and wish for the immediate and violent death of Private Ryan. Again, this resented person(Spielberg) is exorcising his inner demons, and portraying the Germans as cruel monsters without a soul. It was never that way.I sometimes wonder if people in USA go to school, read books or are capable of impartial and independent thought. Are they? I want to believe that there are still intelligent people in USA.The Rambo scene in which the Americans throw mortar grenades to the German tanks made me stop watching the movie. I finished it other day. I found it insulting and utterly repulsive. But of course:What can some poor evil German wretches do against private Ryan and his mariachis? Of course, nothing. Entire panzer divisions would perish against this stronghold of decency, morality, democracy, values, etc. Now, please hold on a second, because i need to puke.I am tired of the growing level of immorality and perversion displayed by Spielberg in his movies. It is all so one sided that makes you sick.I actually would like to watch a movie in which a few dumb German soldiers, behaving like idiots and chewing gum, destroy with stones an entire American armored division. This would be good fun, because this is exactly what Spielberg tries to convey in reverse. Really bad movie, bordering immorality in his depiction of the German side.

		<shortDescription>Greatest film ever made? Mr Coppela is spinning in his grave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost on par with a Uwe Boll movie for its sheer lack of intelligence! Saving Private Ryan was, and to a degree; still is, shown as one of the finest films of the 20th Century, on a par with the Godfather, or Apocalypse Now. I'm sorry, but this is exactly what this film isn't.Here is my list on why this film was such a disgrace...Actors: Who the hell bit Vin Desiel in this movie? The man has no talent of any kind whatsoever! Tom Hanks wasn't the lovable Forest Gump, he wasn't doing well as the average guy and officer trying to do his best for the greater good. The other actors did little to push the roles they where given and as a result where really forgettable.Story: Who the hell told Mr Spealburg this was a good story?!? I'm a Writer myself, and if i had written this I'd have taken myself outside and shot myself straight afterword. Not only was the basic story utter bullocks (Why would the U.S. Army care about this bloke Ryan anyway? in WW2 millions of people died, entire armies where wiped out, not just entire families) but the film is littered with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. It's Stephen Spelburg at his most Romantic (and that means bad for your I.Q. level.) The first sense, yes, it's very good, yes its gory, yes, it's shocking, but it is no where near what real war is like. No where near what combat in the Second World War was like, purely 'cos Stephen Spelburg was NOT there. No one, sides the people who fought there, knows what it was like. No one had scaled the cliff face until a full 6 hours after the invasion began... also, Utah beach was only considered bloody 'cos the defences on the other parts of the 'Mightly' Adlantic wall was an old French Farmer with three teeth and a Spade.That's just the beginning of my list of terrible story points, if I wrote them all, the very Internet it's self would crash.Characters: Who are they? Who cares? Not me, they where all idiots. Stephen Spealburg does not have an emotional bone in his entire body... are we really supposed to care for these poorly crafted, 2 dimensional people? The humour between them was so bad i've seen new Simpson episodes that are better, definitely better written and I for one hate new simpsons.Special Effects: Stephen Speburg is a slave to CGI. Yeh, it is impressive, but it's also pretty poorly constructed and carried out, due to it being filmed in digital time. Stephen Spelburg's #1 student must be a German moron called Uwe Boll, he uses the same camera techniques of shaking to create the illusion of danger and tension, it does work in this film... for 5 seconds, then just gives you sickness in the pit of you're stomach that isn't good for the audiences health (Much like the story).I could go on and on, but i think I'll stop here. It's so damn bad i think I've said everything that needs to be said.One to avoid.</fullReview>

The first 10 minutes is the ONLY bit of this movie worth seeing. Things that come to mind initially - there's not one soldier in the squad who is NOT a blatantly obvious stereotype. The Jewish-American GI crying when he finds the Hitler Youth dagger is a pathetic attempt to jerk a tear out of the audience and that guy (can't remember his name) is an atrocious actor. I actually cheered when he got stabbed later in the film. Tom Sizemore's character collecting dirt so we can see what "tough guy" he is coz he's fought in Italy and France etc...lame! The young private "coming of age" by learning how to gun down unarmed German soldiers...uh huh. The P51 Mustang (an aircraft that was, incidentally, NEVER used as a ground-attack aircraft) saving the day at the end?? Come oooooooon people!! Ever seen Rio Bravo? And not to mention the ridiculous story (which, i don't care what it was based on - is FICTIONAL) about sending 8 men to save 1...if that had really happened those 8 men would have ended up DEAD real quick.And you people (those who have NEVER seen a war besides the lies your government feeds you every night on TV) say this is the most realistic war movie ever made, HOW DARE YOU comment on something you know NOTHING about.If you want a good war movie rent Platoon, Hamburger Hill or The Thin Red Line.

How could the Germans invade almost half of Europe if they are so lousy fighters? Visually the movie is great but the story is unbelievable and the whole movie is way too patriotic. Why would anyone send many men to save one guy? It would have been much easier to contact private Ryan's superiors and send the guy back home.

		<fullReview>With all the hype about this movie, I expected to see a realistic portrayal of war. I also expected to see a true story, which all the trailers claim this movie is. This movie has as much basis in fact as that cheesy soap "The X-Files". Spielberg is trying to mess with everyone's head again, and thanks to this movie, there will be a whole generation of people who think "Saving Private Ryan" really happened. Luckily they teach students better in school. If you want a hard-hitting, realistic portrayal of war, try Arliss Howard in "Full Metal Jacket", Charlie Sheen in "Platoon", Adrien Brody in "The Thin Red Line", Meg Ryan in "Courage Under Fire", or, heck, anything else. This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. The scenes on the beaches are not only gruesomely real, they're breathtakingly brutal, as well as soul-stopping. If the rest of the movie had one tenth the shock-quality or realism the first few minutes had, this movie would have been one of the best war movies ever made.Hollywood glamour has ruined this movie. Thankfully people are too smart to be sucked in by what this movie claims "truly happened", but there are already some schools that are discussing using this movie as a way to teach students about war. Why not use "Starship Troopers"? It's just as realistic, and unlike "Saving Private Ryan", can actually educate. If you walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied and cheated, check out some of the other war movies I mentioned. They are all far better depictions of what war truly is, and unlike SPR, they don't claim to be the truth. For a truly realistic war movie that deserves every award it's been rumored for, check out the 1998 remake of "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a manipulative collection of war film cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype surrounding this film has been nothing short of ridiculous, since the film is nothing more than a host of hoary old war movie cliches slapped on a cornball plot that would have been right at home in the 50s. Total lack of character, particularly in Hanks' performance, which relies more on the viewer's perception of Hanks as an all-American guy rather than any kind of flesh and blood human. The film tries to have it both ways; war is horrible, but hey, we Americans are great and kick butt, especially against those Nazi scum. Total manipulation from a master; not that it would take much to root against the Nazis, but let's have it one way or the other: shades of gray, or black and white. Spielberg wants it both ways. And what about the cheap tactic of using the old veteran, who we later find out is Ryan, linking back to Tom Hanks' character? How about basic continuity, Steve? And the American flag at the beginning and end? It's as if Spielberg thinks the audience is too stupid to know which side to root for. One of the best movies ever made? Hardly. Not even a good movie, period...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why was this loved by all critics? Why was this loved by the academy? Why was this loved by anyone? I think that this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Steven Spielburg remains to be the sappiest director of all time. There was absolutely no point in showing the D-day invasion at the beginning of this film. There was no point to a lot of things in this film. Sure this film was realistic, but I could care less about realism as long as the rest makes sense. There were scenes in this movie that came out of nowhere for no reason. Besides a bunch of nonsense scenes, this movie has a plot that drove me insane. The U.S. government risks the lives of 8 men to save one so that his mother won't be too depressed. The worst part of the entire film however was the showing of Private Ryan as an old man in the cemetery. People were expected to weep through this entire movie, I just wanted to leave, but I stayed thinking it'd get better. Boy was I wrong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overrated and Sentimental. Doesn't have anything new to add to the genre. Re-treads the WWII films of the 1950s and early 1960s. Films like TO HELL AND BACK, PATHS OF GLORY, SANDS OF IWO JIMA, PORKCHOP HILL, THE LONGEST DAY, THE VICTORS, etc. Those films, in my opinion, were fine but I wouldn't want to watch them all over again. That's how I felt sitting in the theater on opening day. Like I was sitting through each and every one of those films. In the overwrought, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg supplies his patented boyish sense of wonder; something, I believe, is out of place in a genre that is often appropriately somber. What I'm saying is, I just want to see a war drama that appeals to the mind rather than the emotions. A film like the brilliant, introspective, THE THIN RED LINE.</fullReview>

To tell a story that so clearly dehumanizes the enemy in this day and age is shameful. It is, to me, propaganda. Despite fighting for the side of the Nazis, most German soldiers were just people. We proud Americans were just as evil and just as exploited during Vietnam. Until people stop believing that 'we' are justified the holocausts will continue.

		<shortDescription>It may be sacrilege, but I'm not a big fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one's supposed to say anything bad about 1998's "Saving Private Ryan" (SPR). To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular film on the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath.The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding but, after that, I didn't find the movie all that engaging or convincing. The characters never struck me as real. I've seen the film twice and both times I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a film. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie (e.g. the original "Apocalypse Now").Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR (including dialogue) simply struck me as annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made you roll your eyes and groan.But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being unAmerican or something (which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government &amp; politicians, particularly the loony Demoncraps).In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as "the greatest war movie ever made." Again, the opening half hour is great but the rest leaves a lot to be desired, which is the bulk of the picture. I've heard the movie hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken "verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion." I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, treacly way Spielberg depicted the events and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The roll-your-eyes dog-tag sequence is just one obvious example.The movie runs 169 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depicts the horror and the violence of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When most people talk about this movie they usually refer to the violence. The extent of the violence portrayed at the beginning of the movie was enough to attract an R rating, though this was lowered to an MA rating because of the purpose of the violence. When I spoke to people about it they seem to dwell upon this point and even talked about the images that went through their minds when they went to sleep and woke up. The image that went through my mind was that of the soldiers under water getting struck by the bullets.The movie opens with the landing at Normandy and graphically shows the horror of this beachhead. This part of the movie I thought was the best part because it really draws out the horror, futility, and waste of war. People were getting healed only to be shot and the bloodbath was intense. The impact of this scene was even greater when three brothers, in three different locations, are killed and their mother is due to receive notice of their death on the same day. Thus the decision is made that they must travel into France and rescue Private Joe Ryan, a paratrooper who was misdropped.The major theme in this movie is the horror of war and this is picked up at the beginning and the whole goal. Mother Ryan is devastated because three of her son's are dead and thus the US army chooses to rescue the forth son because the war has had a great impact on her already and they decide that they need to comfort her by returning to her her only son.Yet there is a purpose behind this war, and even though we look at the immense waste, especially in the beginning, we are reminded through the rest of the movie that the cause they are fighting for is just. They are fighting an oppressive power that intends to enslave the world and as such they are fighting for a noble cause. Even though the cause may be noble, we are reminded that this war brought about an immense waste of life.The violence was graphic at the beginning but as the movie draws near to the end the violence becomes more glorified. The scene that comes to mind is when the soldiers on the tank are shot to pieces with the chaingun. This scene, though graphic and probably realistic, is still, to me, glorified.Purpose is another theme in this movie. The purpose of the mission is to rescue one young man, and throughout the mission they are complaining that they are not helping the war progress. Tom Hanks talks about how when he loses a man he thinks of the thousands of lives that he has saved, but there is an ominous feeling that there is no point to this mission but to save a pathetic little kid; thus it is ironic that when they do find Private Ryan, he refuses to leave his post because they hold one of the only two bridges that Rommel can bring his tanks across to repel the Allied landings.Salvation is another theme that runs through this movie. Unfortunately it is salvation by works. When Ryan is saved, Hanks says to him, "earn it," suggesting that he must now pay back in good deeds for what Hanks has done for him. Then fifty years later he asks his wife (in front of a large family) if he has been good, to which his wife replies, "Yes". This I feel is quite irritating because it suggests that we can earn our salvation, which is not possible. Paying back bad deeds with good is like paying off a loan with a credit card, it simply gets you nowhere. Our sin is so bad and twisted that there is no way we can earn our way into God's good books. Instead we must rely upon what he has done for us, and that is punished his son Jesus instead of us and by trusting this we will be forgiven for what we have done.Saving Private Ryan, I think, has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it falls down in a number of places. I found that the end was very disappointing especially when it seemed to be building up to some very thought provoking ends. Steven Spielburg has the potential to make to earth shattering movies, but he seems to always fall back onto Hollywood sensationalism.(The low rating was on the principle that it won too many Oscars, taking them away from movies that really deserved them.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may be thinking "oh damn, just another over patriotic American being well...patriotic" but no, that's not why I'm here.CONCERNING 'OVER PATRIOTISM':If you're not from America then yes I see where you're coming from if you say the movie is 'too American'. Well, it IS an American war movie, so expect patriotism. As I go through the list of reviews for this movie, almost ALL of the reviews from people who say they're from the US, boast about how great they think the movie is. On the other hand, people from other countries (mainly European) boast that it's too American. For example, the movie starts with the waving American flag and ends with it. It also only shows American soldiers, totally excluding British and Canadian soldiers. Well, the story is about American soldiers looking for, well, an American soldier. So you can expect to see mainly US army men.And yes I do also understand manly other Allied countries played important roles in WWII. Of course the US could not have fought this war alone. At the same time, you should allow the movie to be patriotic. Sorry if Europeans are offended but I have to say it: if it weren't for the United States, Europe would have had a much different fate. So in a sense, you could say that America saved Europe. So please let it be patriotic. The US gave a lot for this war, even in a continent it wasn't in. Europe wasn't even where a majority of American soldiers fought and died. It was the Pacific, against Japan.CONCERNING THE MOVIE ITSELF:Well now that I've got that done, I may as well talk about the movie quality itself. Let me just tell you I thought it was great. The first moments on D-Day at Omaha Beach were gritty, realistic, and tense.The rest of the movie wasn't as great, just soldiers looking for Ryan.The ending I thought was good and very emotional. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haters gonna hate, but still one of the greatest war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to laugh at all the "cool kids" who hate on this movie because of their issues with Spielberg or their need to instantly dislike anything successful. I read through the various 1- star reviews and I have to laugh at the inaccuracies in the reviews as they try to point out inaccuracies or cliché in the movie. I know it is hip and cool to think you are a film snob and all of that but let's get a few things straight.One reviewer mentioned the Omaha Beach scene was unrealistic because at the rate the characters were getting killed, the 1st and 29 Divisions would have been wiped out and unable to continue the war. Well first of all the entire 1st and 29th didn't participate in the first wave, the 16 Regimental Combat Team of the 1st and the 116th RCT of the 29th did, and they were both combat ineffective after the first 10 minutes of the landing.Other complaints mention the entire landing was depicted in 20 minutes when it took several hours to break out from the beach. Um, it is a movie you know? Not a real-time depiction.The movie only shows Americans because Americans were the only soldiers landing at Omaha Beach. The British and Canadians were miles away. I never understand this criticism. The movie is an American movie about an American unit that landed on a beach assigned to Americans. Sorry we can't include every other nation in the Allies. This movie isn't about that. As far as I know, Americans made up the 2nd Rangers and 101st Airborne.To those that complain the Germans were portrayed as bumbling idiots, the Germans made a lot of mistakes in Normandy. They failed to commit their armored reserves in time. They staffed the Atlantic Wall with inexperienced conscripts that were either older or younger than they should have been. Hitler wasn't even made aware of the invasion right away. Even after the breakout the Germans were still convinced the real invasion would be a Calais.Another reviewer complained that the American army would have simply contacted Ryan's unit and ordered the CO to send him home. That would have been impossible for weeks as the Airborne were scattered all over Normandy with no real communication with each other, much less an organized chain of command. Mixed units roaming the countryside was the norm for several days after the landing.Others complain that a squad-sized group could wander around occupied France without being discovered. How is that implausible? Remember the Airborne were mis-dropped all over the region. Small squads moving around undetected was the norm.Radar wasn't a secret in WWII.The P-51 did provide close air-support, even though calling it a "tank buster" is a stretch. The P-47 is more fitting for that role. But hey, they don't look as cool. Its a movie after all. But to the reviewer below that says P-51s were never used for ground support - you are completely wrong.A lot of people claim the movie demonizes the Germans. I am not sure I see that. The Germans fight hard for their country. I don't see where in this film they do anything remotely "evil". They kill the Americans when they get the chance. Wasn't that their job? Weren't they defending their country? It doesn't even really mention Nazis at all. Can someone please point out how the movie shows the Germans as evil? The movie is from an American perspective. Of course the American soldiers are going to think the Germans are evil.I also have to laugh at the people who say the dialog wasn't real because people didn't curse then. Right. Soldiers in WWII didn't say the "f" word. Um, OK.Pick on the dialog all you want, but seriously most of you are reaching at straws. The movie is about as realistic as you can get and still remain a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest war films ever made, with possibly the most graphic and realistic portrayal of combat ever made for the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening 25 minutes of this film are without a doubt some of the most intense, graphic and gruelling moments I've ever had to sit through. You'll never be able to look at another Hollywood war movie the same way again after you've witnessed the intensity of the landing rafts approaching Omaha beach, watching the men on board puking, feeling the tautness of their nerves, and shaking with them. And when they reach the beach and the doors come down, the fighting - or massacre, which would be a more appropriate term for what happens here - begins. This was D-Day on the Normandy beaches, particularly at Omaha, where about 3,000 American soldiers were killed that day. Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller of the 2nd Ranger Battlion, who lands on shore with his men and after a few minutes pinned down in the sand and water, it becomes apparent that the only way to tackle the objective is through sheer power in numbers as they run for the German lines. This is terrifying, as men drop down screaming all around him as we watch the carnage through his eyes. When 'the longest day' is over, and over the next two weeks the Americans move steadily inland, Captain Miller receives orders to take a small squad of soldiers way behind American lines into the French countryside to find a Private James Ryan, who parachuted in with the 501st Airbourne Division. The paratroopers are scattered throughout Normandy, unorganised and lost, and Miller and his men have to locate just one, to send him home, as his three brothers have been killed in action. Having watched "Saving Private Ryan" about eight times now, I can safely come to the conclusion that this is the most realistic war film ever made, in terms of how it portrays combat. I've never seen any other war film to portray combat in such realism and brutality that it made me squirm and realise just how pointless and futile war is. The massive waste of life during the first half an hour just sums it up, as men are killed before they can even move onto the beach. Tom Hanks is absolutely superb as Captain Miller, and he's backed by equally superb performances from Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovani Ribisi and Matt Damon. In my opinion, this is the best film Steven Spielberg has ever made. The first twenty minutes are intense, but the last twenty minutes are equally as gruelling, and the ending is powerful and satisfying. After witnessing the Normandy landings here, I'll never be able to take "The Longest Day" and "The Big Red One" seriously ever again. Winner of 5 Oscars, it could be said that it was robbed of Best Picture, but I won't get into that here. "Saving Private Ryan" is a masterpiece that should be seen by everyone. If not for it's story, then just for the shocking, realistic combat sequences, that needless to say get us as close to war without witnessing it that any of us can possibly get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDITEDSteven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name "Ryan" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurrence in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944.Starring, Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel , Adam Goldberg , Barry Pepper , Giovanni Ribisi , Matt Damon , Dennis Farina , Ted Danson , Harve Presnell , Dale Dye , Bryan Cranston , David Wohl , Paul Giamatti , Ryan Hurst , Harrison Young , Max Martini , Dylan Bruno.Directed by my all time favorite, Steven Spielberg.Nominated for much deserving 11 Oscars, while winning 5 which includes Best Director, Cinematography, Editing, Sound and Sound effects/Editing. while the other six nominations were for Best Picture, Lead Actor Tom Hanks, Original Screenplay, Art Direction, Make Up and original Score. i thought it also deserved Best Picture.now this is the movie that gives you a serious shock when you see it, beware because you might nit be able to complete this movie. i saw this movie when i was young from the part where they are ordered to find Pvt. Ryan so i missed the beginning, the epic beginning but still there were some violent fights throughout the movie. i decided to watch this movie again today.yes this is one of the very best war movies, one of my all time favorites and one of the best movies ever made. i may not be able to call it the best war movie ever but i certainly will call it the most realistic depiction of war. this is another war movie from Steven Spielberg, but this time actual on field war. it is set during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. the film is a fiction account of four brothers, four sons of Agnes Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania. The brothers were killed in the American Civil War but the writer decided to include that story into World War II scenario.the opening sequence has to be one of the most memorable sequences in the history of motion Picture, the intensity of those 27 minutes is indescribable in words, shocking, intense, chilling, realistic, gory, a torture in fact. it depicts the Omaha beachhead assault of June 6, 1944. after that, seven other men along with Capt. John sets out to find Pvt. Ryan and during there are some fight scenes too but the opening was a horror a scary nightmare. and i am not saying it was awful, it was realistic in a way no one ever did and i more than appreciate Spielberg for it. you see that is exactly what happens.Tom Hanks gave another brilliant performance. i would call it his best Non-Oscar winning performance. he was just brilliant as Captain. greatly done. and overall every other supporting cast gave some pretty good performances like, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel , Adam Goldberg , Barry Pepper , Giovanni Ribisi , Matt Damon. really emotional, strong and good performances. but Hanks was the one which actually was pitch perfect. Matt Damon in a small role leaves an impact on you.excellent daring direction from Spielberg, many people still may think it was overdone or something. but i loved it. he deserved the awards he got for it. Screenplay was mindblowing. editing was nice. cinematography, art direction and Score were really good. effects and sounds along with make up design was something you will really like. camera movements were like so real, like we are in the middle of a war scene with live broadcast. technically spot on.this whole experience was just epic, intense and very sad for me. a mindblowing cinematic experience. a classic. excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic that Really Captures the Horrors and casualties of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to many people, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films ever made. They are absolutely correct. This film won several Oscars and it deserved them.Saving Private Ryan is a perfect example of a film that accurately captures the horrors of war.The film opens with an impressive recreation of the battle on Omaha Beach. The scene wastes no time in showing us just how horrifying and chaotic the battle really was.The rest of the plot focuses on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), a young paratrooper who landed somewhere behind enemy lines. He has three brothers who were all killed in action, and the military decides he should get sent home. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) is chosen to lead the search for the young private. The film is simply brilliant. The acting's excellent,the story is well written, and it manages to brilliantly depict how horrifying and tragic war can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Soft Heart and a Solid War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After discovering that three of his brothers have been killed in battle, the War Department orders a group of soldiers to "save" Private Ryan and send him home to his mother. This act creates a fair amount of conflict, and from there the story really picks up.Steven Spielberg, while a fine director, often becomes sentimental and smarmy. This is no exception. But for the most part, the battles are fierce, the wounds are bloody and the death toll is high. Considered by many to be the greatest of all war films, it easily ranks up there in my book.What I loved most about this film? The casting of Nathan Fillion and Jeremy Davies. Oh my, I can never get enough of those two gentlemen. Beyond that, the realism and the brutality shines through. I appreciate that the Americans executed surrendering Germans (and on one occasion, Czechs) rather than took them prisoner. Is it right? No. But it's realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Neverending Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is probably an exciting 90-minute movie lurking inside this never ending war epic about the search for a soldier. However, in an attempt to make a war movie to end all war movies, Spielberg did not leave anything on the cutting room floor, releasing the film with a running time of 17 hours or so. The much-admired battle scene depicting the Normandy landing is well done but what's the point of having it go on for 20 minutes, with gratuitous shots of severed limbs and guts literally spilling out? OK, war is hell, but many other films have made this point far more eloquently and succinctly. The acting is pretty good, although the characters are all war movie stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is everything you expect it to be and more. I left the cinema totally numb after this experience, not knowing how I really felt about the movie. All I was thinking was why? Do we really need a another movie about the atrocities of war? Perhaps I just don't want to know the truth or see the reality of this horror that mankind seems determined to continually perpetuate. The heart of man is evil continually. Even more frightening than this is the fact that the powers of the world who have set their minds to war and murder to maintain control would not even think twice after viewing this film.For Spielberg this film was evidently a lot more than just a revelation of World War II. This was a message from son to father, a call for approval from a boy to his dad. The fact that Arnold Spielberg was overcome with emotion may indicate that his boy did good this time. Steven is as masterfully in control of this film as he was with "Schindler's List". I still feel the earlier film is his dramatic best, yet it is difficult to fault "Private Ryan" in its execution. It is only its concept that I am still battling with.Tom Hanks plays yet another all American, this time the captain who is ordered to take a small band of men to find Ryan. His performance was strong, yet I was not truly blown away as I expected to be. Perhaps I have come to expect too much of the great Mr. Hanks. The support cast are also intense, and include Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg and Barry Pepper. Special mention goes to Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Horvath, Jeremy Davies as the timid Corporal Upham and Matt Damon, credible as the last of the Ryan brothers. Ted Danson and Dennis Farina drop in as senior officers.Spielberg has again teamed with "Schindler's" cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and the results are astounding. The opening sequence is particularly breathtaking. John Williams is of course the only choice for original score. In this impacting picture, I barely noticed his composition. That probably indicates how good it was. Art direction and set decoration are both awesome.The enormity of the film cannot be denied, neither I suppose can its importance. With all my reservations, it is one of the first - if not the first - movies not to gloss over World War II. It is for this reason I must recommend all those who can handle it go and see it; and it is also why I find it so hard to mark this film down.Sunday, December 13, 1998 - Bairnsdale CinemasThere are two ways to look at "Saving Private Ryan". Technicallly and philosophically. Let me address both briefly.Technically the film has few faults. Certainly, cinematography, sound effects and sets are all astounding. You cannot be anything but blown away by the opening sequence. Spielberg shows again he is a master craftsman, able to bring any vision from within his imagination to the silver screen. He takes this simple story of an unusual rescue mission in the middle of World War II, and turns it into an unforgettable movie experience. Tom Hanks is amazing as Captain Miller, playing with perfect understatement the weary commanding officer who must lead his band of eight men in search of Private Ryan. In impressive support is Tom Sizemore, fantastic as the tough sarge who backs Miller all the way. An excellent support cast back these two compellingly.Philosophically, I have argued before that this film was brilliant yet unnecessary; that we have seen enough graphic anti-war films and that this was one too many. On second viewing, it is very hard to keep this argument up. Even if we have seen a dozen films such as this, "Saving Private Ryan" is still a very important film. Why? It shows us the horror that war is. The waste, the destruction and the total futility of the whole thing. Why do we keep destroying each other like this? What is wrong with us? I still argue that "Schindler's List" was a more important film, and perhaps a better one. This film rates right up there though.Saturday, January 8, 2000 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just only for saving private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its cast , story , visual effects , production and direction saving private Ryan is an excellent experience to watch. The film starts in present United States than enters in its main plot of 1944 France at the occasion of d-day. Here Tom hanks along with his juniors including Tom Sizemore, Edward burns, Berry Pepper , Vin Diesel , and Giovnanni Ribsi are assigned to a task seek out Pfc James Francis Ryan and relieve him off the duty to send him home. The reason here is that he is only surviving son of widow who already lost her older sons in this war. As a gesture of humanity and sympathy , Chief of Army staff General George.C.Marshall himself ordered the search and transfer of private Ryan back to homeland. When Tom Hanks and his fellow comrades begin their search for their objective they had to go through hell on some places , in it they lost some of their own few men. The most compelling scene was the death of Giovanni Ribsi , the way he acted in that scene was so much disturbing but also showed his remarkable skill to portray the dying man. After a hectic long tense journey into the heart of France they spotted Pfc Ryan played here by Matt Damon ,told him the gruesome news of his bros death, but he refuses to leave , he believes that his fellow officers are also sons of other people ,they are also his brothers in arms, why he is only one to be left out of here. Then the team decided to stay but inside Capt Miller (Tom Hanks) had made a pledge not to let Pfc Ryan(Damon) to be harmed and left alone in harms way. Being a war movie lover i am very impressed by this film, if you are , you ll also be moved , its 3 hr long but very very good in the making and contains a strong plot. One of the best war movie of all time perhaps that 's why it finished with 5 Oscars although Thin Red Line was also competing against it with a huge inventory of cast &amp; crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie totally amazed me. The cast was very good, and Tom Hanks once again amazed me. He gives an even better performance than in Forrest Gump. The sound is clear and realistic, and it makes the battles seem even more intense. The 2 main battles are very violent, and the violence is very realistic looking. This movie is definitely not for young viewers, but is amazing nonetheless. An emotional and and unforgettable experience, with touches of humor here &amp; there. This movie just shows you how horrible and cruel this war was, and how many lives were lost. This may be my favorite movie ever, and this is the movie that really got me interested in war movies, such as We Were Soldiers. A highly recommended movie, even for people who don't like violent movies, this has an involving and original story, and is just...great! This movie definitely deserves the five Academy Awards it won. See it. Love it. See it again.</fullReview>

I really don't think you should should show it to your kids. But, if you are an adult, then this is a must-see, it is pure awesome, and in my opinion, better than platoon or even Apocalypse now. Everything about this movie is pretty much perfect. It has action, drama, and REALLY good acting and directing. This was WAY better than Shakespeare in love and should have won best picture and best acting.please for your own sake, go see it10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Battle Scenes And A Thought Provoking Consideration Of The Value Of A Human Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely this movie presents some of the most believable, most graphic and most gruesome scenes of war ever shown on film. The opening depiction of the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day and the closing battle as American soldiers desperately try to hold a strategically key bridge against a German attack are brilliantly and soberingly portrayed, and if there was nothing else in this movie worth watching, those battle scenes in and of themselves are a powerful lesson about the horrors of war.The battle scenes serve as an envelope around the main story - the search for Private James Ryan. As the movie begins we learn that Ryan's three brothers have all been killed in battle, and he's the only one of his mother's sons left. Gen. George Marshall (quoting from an eloquent letter written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who lost 5 sons in the Civil War) orders Ryan found so that he could be returned home before being killed himself, and a squad under Capt. Mitchell (Tom Hanks) is assigned to the task. Believability is a bit of an issue here. I doubt that in the middle of a great war soldiers would be taken away from battle and assigned to this task. Having said that, the very lack of believability gives the search for Ryan it's meaning, and serves as the movie's moral or philosophical purpose. The constant question before the viewer is: how many lives are we willing to sacrifice to save one? There's no answer to that question, but it remains front and centre as even the soldiers assigned to find Ryan increasingly resent the assignment and question its value. The constant challenge I found myself faced with was how I would have felt if I were assigned to find a soldier in such circumstances so that he could be sent home while I stayed to fight a war - and possibly die? Thought-provoking.Still, I didn't think this reached the heights of greatness that some have given it. Thought-provoking it may have been, but between the great battle scenes there were also long stretches with little happening, and overall the movie was too long at more than an hour and a half. It's a movie that's certainly worth watching - but only once. I wouldn't want to see it again. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen this film until about 3 months ago. I've been recently going through a list of movies that everyone seems to rave about and this was number one. Before I tell you my number one and only problem with this film I must say the acting and the story line along with the special effects are excellent, a very well cast crew really. Now my number one problem was the amount of gore. Im fairly strong stomached when it come to violence in movies but this was confronting to say the least. I think that if the movie had what we Australians call M15+ it would have been a much better movie. The storyline and characters where so strong that the violence for me cheapens the movie, more a kin to a B grade horror movie. Prehaps I'm just soft, but i would prefer not to see this movie again which is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an utterly commendable and harrowing portrait of the nature of war and one of the most important films of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening notes of John Williams' somber and tear-jerking music score, followed by an old man wandering sadly through a World War II cemetery, and then to the deservedly infamous twenty-minute recreation of the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, and straight through to the end of the picture, it's adamantly clear that Steven Spielberg's epic masterpiece "Saving Private Ryan" is not just another war film on the shelves in the history of cinema. Coupled with Oliver Stone's "Platoon", this is perhaps the single greatest cinematic take on the nature of war ever made.Based on a true story, "Saving Private Ryan" stars Tom Hanks as a World War II squad captain who is given the treacherous assignment to take seven other soldiers and go behind enemy lines in search of a missing paratrooper named Ryan whose brothers have been killed in action. And as noble as a mission as that sounds, the reaction from the soldiers is exactly what it would be in real life: we'll obey our orders, but is one man worth risking the lives of eight? That's the spirit of "Saving Private Ryan" and that's the spirit of war itself. Gone are the days where war was portrayed as like some kind of an end-of-season tournament and when soldiers were portrayed as being like a rowdy and pretentious baseball team on their great skirmish. Instead of glamorizing violence and giving us all-American heroes, "Saving Private Ryan" depicts war as what it is: a harrowing, traumatizing, unforgettably bad, soul-corrupting experience. The effect war and violence has on people is personified perfectly in a line given by Hanks about halfway through the film: "For every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel." The movie opens up with a twenty-minute battle sequence of which the likes have never been on the screen. We don't just see people being shot to death, we see explosions that send mutilated bodies flinging through the air, we see soldiers lying on the ground mortally wounded, spending their last breaths crying for their mothers and wanting to go home, and the Atlantic shoreline becomes red with blood. There is nothing glamorous or exciting about a scene like this. Rather, the reaction the audience gives is hung jaws, wide eyes, and a new appreciation for what our soldiers did in the call of duty and how lucky any of them were to live to see home again.Another strength of the movie is that it does not only depict war as being horrifying, but it also makes neither heroes out of its protagonists or personifications of evil out of the enemy. As I mentioned earlier, the soldiers led by Tom Hanks are not cheerful, joke-throwing boys. They are cynical, rundown, exhausted, and pessimistic who spend a great deal of their time not charging out into enemy fire and dying in the blaze of glory, but cowering behind rubble. And that's the exact same of the German soldiers portrayed in the film. After all, they were drafted into a war as well. If it were not for the war, these men killing each other may have otherwise been best friends. In a way, the movie is not about the mission to rescue Private Ryan who is neither seen nor heard until well into the movie's running time, but about the very experience of trying to survive just one day through a war."Saving Private Ryan" is not only a technical triumph, but an intellectual one as well. Apart from showing us what war is really like and the effect it really has one people and nations, the movie creates three-dimensional human beings out of its characters, the story is very well-constructed, the dialogue by screenwriter Robert Rodat is first-class, and the acting, of course, top-notch. The combination of these elements gives us a representation of war that we can believe. Now when people think of war, they think of men lying on the ground dying and not grinning heroes dodging bullets as if life or death is merely a video game and they can try again if they fail the first time.This is one of Steven Spielberg's very best films. It ranks up with films such as "Jaws", "Schindler's List", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial" as some of the greatest and most important films ever made. Now "Saving Private Ryan" may be too gritty and vulgar for the tastes of some people, but I think it should be required viewing for anybody going into the service or even thinking of the like. Because war is not a baseball game. And it's not something anybody wants to experience more than once, if at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome To Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never understood Hollywood's love affair with Tom Hanks. He's no more than ordinary both in appearance and as an actor. Perhaps that's what they like; the stamp of the common man. Well for me, he's a turn-off. Him, Costner and Cage; I can't help taking points away when any of 'em show up.All that said; this movie opens pretty quickly into the most spellbindingly visceral battle sequence ever shown on film. It really is a tour-de-force. The withering German machine-gun fire wiping out man after man before they've even set foot ashore is terrible and shocking to behold. Truly those weapons made flesh all but obsolete in battle. I am not a Spielberg fan either. His delight in maudlin sentimentality - or 'schamltz' as it's called - knows no boundaries. Neither does his childish irony. But when it comes to large set-piece special effects, he has no master. The few minutes of beach landing are alone worth the price of the DVD. It's as close as you can get to the real thing and still leave the cinema alive. I'm told that a group of vets got to see this movie at a private showing and gave this sequence a standing ovation. You can't say fairer than that.Afterwards, the story moves on, with Hanks and his remaining squad looking to find Private Ryan, who is the only surviving son in a family stricken by war. And here Mr Spielberg falls into his usual routine of hokey irony. There's a suddenly collapsing wall that reveals Germans on the other side. There's a German humanely allowed by Hanks to simply wander free, only to re-emerge as his assassin, there's a case of mistaken identity that's milked for every silly little nuance imaginable. And there's a lot more. Like I said; it's often childish.There are other interesting and engaging conflicts, though they pale in comparison with that full-on intro. There are excellent set-pieces, authentic gunfire, and believable slaughter. Editing, lighting and all of the other technical issues are right up to the standard you expect from Big Stevie. Yet most of the second 2 hours fail to answer that hellishly vivid beach landing. It's a measure of how strong the one is, and how weak the other. We are left with a slow, flagging, and largely forgettable odyssey.Highly recommended for that opening assault. That's where my 9 stars have gone. The rest is simply in at the price, with Spielberg's juvenility and Hanks's irritating voice for good measure.I would like to see a movie about WW1 treated with the same ruthless candour. The casualties of Omaha and The Somme scarcely withstand comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in my life have I ever seen a more beautifully written film. I've watched this film 20 times over and it still touches my heart. I always look for violence in a movie, because I believe it shows reality and this movie does just that with it's gut wrenching brutality. I tell people who haven't seen that they need to watch it A.S.A.P. Not just because of the violence, I'm not like that, but by the completely accurate point of view of the soldiers during and even after the war.I am one of those people that is impossible to make cry, and folks this movie made me bawl my eyes out. The ending Tom Hanks scene is so stunning and heart-wrenchingly sad that I couldn't bear it, yet I still watched the ending. That scene is also surprising considering that the beginning threw me of guard with the old man in the opening scene, I thought he was Tom Hanks. (Sorry for the spoilers) Also, Giovanni Ribisi must be credited for his character's emotional role especially in the church seen when he talks about his mother.Now to the violence, people I was 13 when I saw this film. Do your self a favor if you are a parent, if your child is under 13 do not let them watch it. There are even worse violent movies such as "The Thing." But the difference in this movie is that what happens to the soldiers more than likely really happened to them, mostly the beginning on Omaha Beach. I, personally, think the violence was completely necessary because we needed to show what our soldiers fought for and what they gave in order for us to live on as the ruling country of the world. God-bless America and it's men.The language in the film is quite foul, but hey what would you be saying if you were being shot at by 20-cals? I also think the swears were necessary. Why? Well, I believe that swears bring out emotion and how you feel about situations you are in. I mean don't get me wrong if your child swears, by all means put soap in his mouth or whatever you do. But in movies, swears give us an understanding about the stand-point of the characters. It's also pretty funny to boot. The jokes in this are hilarious.Anyway, if you are looking for the greatest movie ever made, watch this. Because I don't think I'll ever find a movie close to being as good as this. Thanks to Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and thanks mostly to those who gave their lives to keep us standing strong with the freedom we have rightfully earned. You will not be forgotten, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best WWII Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is a flawless war movie. Spielberg created a set that looks like the actual French battlefield of World War II. The beginning of the movie shows the Allied invasion of Normandy Beach on D-Day, and it is very hard to watch. Men die and are reduced to gory heaps in the first seconds of battle. People who are expecting a Chuck Norris war movie with a few US soldiers killing hundreds of comical Nazis are going to be surprised. The film has a fantastic ensemble cast - up there with films such as Heat and Tombstone. All supporting actors are given believable characters. No one appears to utter a one-liner and is never seen again. Movie buffs will find themselves saying, "Hey, I know that guy!", but it never detracts from the immersion. This is a heavily pro-American film. It makes little effort to characterize the German soldiers, but none is needed. Overall, this is my favorite film from 1998, and one of my favorite war movies.</fullReview>

Though some might find the extensive and intense gore too prevalent, to me, it exhibits the true cost and effect of war that is generally left out of lesser films.Ethan Hinch is wrong.

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man. The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: "It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles." Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two. If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving and Riveting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saving Private Ryan" is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg. Vin Diesel). The film opens with the harrowing D-Day landings, following Captain Miller and his men. The unit is given the mission of finding and getting Private James Ryan out of the war. His 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make. A lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him. There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war. However, a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over. One is a conversation in which Miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally. The movie does not glorify war, but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality. Though there a more violent films out there, such as We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition), "Saving Private Ryan" definitely does not gloss over anything. This is a profoundly moving movie, and one that I have seen more than once. Every viewing is moving. It is simply a great story, well-acted, well-directed and engrossing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many special effects, too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie highly disappointing. I was expecting something different. Well, If you like special effects, then you will definitely enjoy it. But if not -and that is my case, I have to admit- you will most likely find it boring and too long. The first thirty minutes of the movie are just a huge display of special effects showing the development of one of the most important battles during the II WW. Yes, it is very well-made but this half an hour doesn't add anything at all to the movie. I am still wondering what is the goal of so much time devoted to that battle- I think the best answer is: an excuse for displaying all the special effects. Once those minutes had finished, I hoped the rest of the movie would be something different, and it looked like that was going to happen, but not for a lot of time. When something interesting was finally going on and there were some interesting dialogs, once again the same: more shooting, more noise and more deaths... Anyway, my vote was a 7: apart from all those long unnecessary scenes, the movie is quite good: some interesting dialogs, as I said, an interesting plot and, above all, some great performances, especially from Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In every aspect of this film, from the writing by Robert Rodat to the production of every scene, there is mastery. Saving Private Ryan has multiple WWII scenes that although not all historically correct, all outstanding. I watched this movie with my fiancé and we both were extremely impressed with the whole movie. The opening 27 min. Omaha Beach scene proved well awarded the best opening scene as well as the whole movie with the 5 Oscars, 50 something other awards won and another 50 something nominations for various awards. The story line of a mission to save a fellow comrade is one that hits so close to home for many families these days and it really gives them hope that if there loved one is still over in Iraq, they might too be saved. From the actors like Tom Hanks and sexy Matt Damon, to the small details in every scene (or big like the 40,000 gallons of fake blood for the opening scene), it was just a mind blowing movie that really makes you appreciate everyone fighting for our freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg goes back to WWII with this film, which is about a group of soldiers who risk their lives in action to save one: Private James Francis Ryan. The scenery in the invasion sequences are so horrific, that it's shocking to think that this stuff actually happens. Which it does. I couldn't watch it without flinching, crying, and being afraid of things like that.I pray that there won't be a WWIII, because all war is hell. I don't even support the war in Iraq. I want our troops out of there. They don't deserve to have their insides blown out, regardless of what the war is about. It's also why I don't play war video games. I don't think that war is a thing to be glorified in games. I think that it's a horrible thing that should have never existed.So, to finish, I would like to thank Steven Spielberg for opening my eyes to war and how war should not be glorified, it should be looked down upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My grandpa actually landed on Normandy and told me all about it. He landed on Fox Red sector. He told me the true face of war until I literally saw it flash before my eyes. The opening D-Day scene is horrific but detailed in a great manner of graphic violence and gore. Unless you are not one of them (as I can) who can handle such strong intensity, this movie is not for you. It is a great movie and shows that there is nothing that should be glorified about war. Saving Private Ryan shows how 8 men will risk their lives for 1 after Private James Ryans brothers, Peter, Sean, and Daniel have been killed in action and Captain John H. Miller from the 2nd Rangers battalion and his squad is sent to find James and send him home before he is KIA along with the rest of his brothers. I give it a 10 out of 10 for a great story line and it even loosely is based on the true story of the Niland Brothers. It has won over 5 academy awards and on over 150 10 best lists. This movie is great for a WWII movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the best war movie you will ever see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far best WWII movie i have ever seen and in general on of the best movies. It is thrilling emotional funny and shows all the folly and tragedy of war. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie there are scenes of intense realistic combat. This movie is truly a work of art. Everything about it is real. The bloodshed, the style of guns, the talk,the gore, absolutely everything. Except for the storyline, which i won't go into, everything about this movie is 100% realistic and accurate. Not once in the movie did I say to myself "that wouldn't happen in real life." The action scenes are incredible. You'll see classic WWII weapons being used like the BAR, M1 Garand, classic bayonets etc. The violence is so real and that often you will wonder whether or not the actors are actually dead. This movie shows all forms of combat. Guns, flamethrowers, sniping, tanks, planes, and of course several sequences of up close and personal/bloody.The scenery may very well be the best in annyyy movie I've seen, not just war movies. While watching I was shocked to think how much time was devoted to this. Crumbling buildings, destroyed tanks, dead cows, cratered land; everything. Every step of the movie you will be thinking that they went back in time to those areas, because it will be so hard to believe that most of it was filmed in a studio.This movie won a deserving Oscar for cinematography, and for good reason. I can only surmise how many camera's were used in making this film. Because of professional cinematography, the action doubles. Everything is done so well. Explosions are shown from several angles at such a fast pace that you'll once again think that this must actually be happening.The acting is great in this movie. Most of the soldiers act like typical grunts who enjoy seeing a German killed, while show true sympathy and sorrow if/when any of their comrades die or during a breakdown when all the fighting gets to them.To cut this review short, because there are about a dozen other topics to touch upon this incredible movie, this is a true classic, great drama, terrific directing and keeps you involved and not bored during this 2hour and 35 minute movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see a masterpiece likes this lets me know that there really are great movies out there. Not just a movie that's spat out, millions of dollars wasted on a movie that has no purpose.This movie has a great purpose. War is hell, it should be prevented. Not just that but many more that can be seen throughout watching this thrilling movie. If only I got to see it with surround sound and HD, I watched it at home on my bad television, but I want to let everybody know the special effects in this movie surpass many movies from present day. Sound is top notch, acting is brilliant, the camaraderie seen between the men makes it seem like a real battle field. Everything about this movie is so real. It's as if you were on the battlefield yourself. This movie is not like any other war movie where the story starts off with the troop at home, then getting deployed, then mindless scenes of battle followed by a predictable finish.This movie started powerful to the deployment of the troops on Omaha Beach all the way to the end. This movie had great action, internal conflicts, a plot to find Private Ryan, a story going on back in the United States. Everything connects in this great piece. This movie is just breathtaking. I keep repeating it, but when the movie was over, I was sad it was over, and I would definitely see it ten more times to witness the sheer brilliance of Steven Spielberg and everybody else who contributed to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg second best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. Not as Good as Ridley Scott and Michael Bay, but he comes close. Very Close. One of his best films is by far the best WWII film, Saving Private Ryan. Like Michael Bay and John Woo after him, Spielberg films his movie in a gritty, realistic fashion that has a slight documentary effect to it.After the grisly violent battle of Normandy, an Army secretary discovers three out of four brothers have been killed. General George Marshall, despite the odds, demands the final Soldier, James Ryan, be found and sent back home. Captain John Miller and a team of battle-hardened soldiers, save one, and start trekking through German-occupied France to find James Ryan and send him back to the States. Along the way each man is tested to the limit, and some of them will never live to see America once again.The battles of Saving Private Ryan are probably the most realistic there are. Some of the scenes in the Normandy Invasion sequence are chillingly cold and merciless and the F-Bomb is used repeatedly in this film so I would not recommend it as a little kids film. Plus, several of the characters, mainly Barry Pepper, are a little creepy. Tom Hanks switches successfully from comedy to drama by playing the gruff Captain Miller while Matt Damon gives all he can give as the young James Ryan who won't rest until his mission is complete. The rest of the cast are unforgettable as well as the supporting cast. John Williams has a very small score in this movie, but the one piece to listen to is his masterpiece 'Hmyn to the Fallen', an incredibly moving piece that will make you remember all those who have fallen in battle.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie didn't move</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I think there might be something wrong with me, because I'm the only one who seems not to like this movie. But I have my reasons.First of all, this movie seems a bit contradictory in its message. Is it supposed to be antiwar, or are we supposed to be cheering at the gore? Speaking of gore, they wasted it all in the first battle of the film, which is also the first scene after the prologue scene. No good storyteller does that. Since the most graphic images were at the beginning, most everything else seemed tame in comparison.Secondly, this really isn't Spielberg's best film at all. It moves very slowly and is full of scenes that try to build characterization but somehow manage to seem sappy. I'll give him and the screenwriter credit for trying, however.Also, this is possibly John Williams' worst movie score ever. The music is the kind you can find in any war movie--it's sort of cheesy and not at all amazing like many of his other works.Lastly, this movie simply does not move. Maybe it was just me, but it didn't evoke much of an emotional reaction out of me, and I'm normally quite an emotional moviegoer.Tom Hanks did a very good acting job, and the others did okay. But too many of the lines were whispered, or at too low a volume.Maybe it's just me, but this movie didn't move.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is not just the best war film ever put to movie screens. It is also one of the best movies of all time. The movie begins with an almost documentary type invasion of Normandy on D-Day. This is so realistic and so well done, you would almost think Spielberg and company had a time machine and filmed it the day it happen. The action is so intense and so amazing, you would think the movie would falter after this. But then again, it doesn't. This movie real story is about Captain John Miller leading a platoon of men to go save Private Ryan. He must save Private Ryan, because he is the only remaining son of a woman stateside. This seems ironic, because all these men must risk their lives for one mother's only living son. And as the squad is led through some dangerous turf, they don't know how much they will have to eventually risk to save one man. A wonderful told epic that just shows how much one life can really be worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Realistic War Movie I Have Ever Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us, it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film. The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing! Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell-shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service. That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan. His other brothers having all recently perished in combat, leaving him the only remaining son.The movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan. You go through the movie hoping that Hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shot.What made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story! One of my favorite all-time war movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent war film with occasionally poor dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of verisimilitude to an actual battlefield, Saving Private Ryan is without a peer in the history of film. I go back to the 1910s, Birth of a Nation, which had some panoramic battle scenes, and to Platoon, which had some credible scenes, to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now (which is the closest challenger for realism), Black Hawk Down, The Big Parade (wonderfully realistic early silent film of WW One), and many others. None of those takes so much effort and genius in recreating a probable past, in terms of recreating the war torn battlefields/villages in the most minute detail. The first 20 minutes of this film are a landmark by which all other war films will eventually be measured.Tom Hanks is the emotional anchor for this film, giving us a portrayal that is sensitive yet firm. He's not of the blood and guts John Wayne tradition. His character is a thoughtful man who finds himself in a position to, in his view, do some good in the world by managing this apocalypse on earth in such a way that it actually saves lives.Spielberg's consistent attention to visual detail and style is what sets SPR apart. The images are grainy, and rely on blues, greens, grays, and browns, with scarcely any red or yellow. He creates battlefield scenery with precision, accuracy, and depth of field. Wonderful work.Meanwhile, set against this, is a dialogue which can be passively entertaining at times. The urgent conversations in the battlefield are most effective. However, some of the more heavy conversations which take place during the lulls are so poorly thought out, I can scarcely believe any professional screenwriter could have been associated with them. This is a recurrent problem.Finally, I guess it couldn't be avoided that a film like this would attempt to advance allied propaganda. Genreally, the film tries to stay away from that, and I give it credit, but at other times the propaganda asserts itself in a subtle way which detracts from the overall effect. Most Americans and Western Europeans are numb to this, but I notice it and it disappoints me, although I will reckon that this film does not lose itself in propaganda. It's just an overtone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan has been out for damn near seven years and i just saw it for the first time yesterday. And i must say it is pretty damn great. The combat scenes are the best i have seen in any World War II movie, especially the amazing opening scene on the beaches of Normandy. They are full of exciting and grisly action and speed along the three-hour runtime. Ryan is also packed with a great cast who all give excellent performances especially Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Jeremy Davies. Heck, even Vin Diesel was good. Yes i said Vin Diesel. Maybe he just gets bad scripts lately.The only things keeping this from being the best war movie ever is it's sappy storyline and one-sidedness. Nobody is saying the Nazis are saints, but their foot soldiers were there for the exact same reasons the American foot soldiers were. Their stupid leaders sent them there.Saving Private Ryan is still one of the best war movies of all time. It's explosive action and great acting keeps it interesting throughout its runtime and it proves that Steven Spielberg can make a darn entertaining flick. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How lovely. A US Platoon must risk itself in order to find Pvt Ryan. His brothers all died in the war, all within days. He is the only one left. So, the US Army decides to save him. Problem is, in all the confusion after the invasion on 6 June 1944, they don't really know where he is. So, a platoon is assembled under Tom Hanks and off they go. The special effects are great. The siting of the German Machine Guns was not historical. In reality, they were off to the sides of the beaches and their fire hit the PBI (Poor Bloody Infantry) from the side as they advanced. Also, it took more than a wad of bubble gum on the end of a bayonet to breach the defences. In actual fact, some destroyers almost beached themselves to fire point blank into the defences. Anyway, another bug is that the Waffen SS "2nd Division" is depicted as the attacking enemy in the film's climax. In reality, they didn't arrive in Normandy for quite some time. With all the historical flaws, one can be forgiven. After all, this IS a movie. If you want an historical film on D Day, see "The Longest Day". If you want a more believable war film in general, see "The Thin Red Line", "Cross of Iron" or "Stalingrad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compare this to "They were Expendable"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until I saw "Private Ryan" I thought the best film about World War II was John Ford and Robert Montgomery's "They were Expendable". Now I can say that "Private Ryan" is to the European War what "Expendable" was to the Pacific War. They both convey a common message: that sometimes war must be fought, that we not shrink from what needs to be done, that we never forget the sacrifice and, most importantly, that we make ourselves worthy of that sacrifice.World War II wasn't just something that happened. It was Armageddon, in which the future of the world was at stake. And that's no exaggeration. Those who died in the endeavor gave us the right outcome are, to me, true martyrs, not to religion or patriotism but to humanity itself. I think this is what both Expendable and Private Ryan are reminding us, by dramatizing the message, not preaching it.Despite the advances in film-making technology that make "Saving Private Ryan" a more intense experience than "They were Expendable," both are magnificent films which compliment each other. Both have been given splendid DVD transfers, and it is fascinating to watch them back-to-back to compare how similar events are portrayed in the idioms of two different eras. Spielberg has the advantage of being in an era without the constraints, both technical and political, suffered by Ford. Unlike Ford, Spielberg is free to add, "And lest we forget ? to bring home the meaning of sacrifice ? here's an unvarnished look at what really happened to those who didn't come back."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best War Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No. That is all in the opinion of the viewer. The AFI can hail "Citizen Kane" the best movie of all time, but then cast a blind eye towards "Aliens" in their 100 Thrillers. Moral: No one is infallible.To be blunt, there are good war movies (Das Boot, Apocalypse Now) and there are bad ones (almost anything with John Wayne fits here). Saving Private Ryan is a good war movie, even great at some points, but once again Spielberg falls into the "sentimental showman" trap that frequents his films. Whether in Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, or Indiana Jones 3, he starts trying to evoke an emotional response by trying too hard. As they say "the harder you try, the dumber you look."As far as general film quality goes, this movie is superb. Kaminski's tight camera angles coupled with the color desaturation gives "Private Ryan" an almost black-and-white archaic look reminiscent of a WWII documentary. The characters look gaunt and pale, enhancing the sickening look of the movie.Is this better than "Shakespeare in Love"? Certainly, but not as good as "Life is Beautiful". Unfortunately, "The Thin Red Line" does not match up because Malick winds up making just an art film. Should Hanks have gotten the Oscar? Yes, compared to "Forrest Gump", he is far above that level here. Seen one war movie, seen them all. That's what you should understand before watching this. There is no difference between "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket", and "All Quiet on the Western Front" compared to this. They all have the same characters, the same morals, the same conclusions. Bummer.John Williams: someone give the guy a complementary Oscar. I have yet to hear a bad composition on his part other than "Midway". In addition, the makeup and production design are far superior to the "Shakespeare in Love".Most compliments go towards the opening 25 minutes of the movie--and it deserves it. I feel that the final battle should seriously get more credit than it has. Michael Kahn's editing and the super sound work enhance the fight in an almost "Wild Bunch" fashion. Overall, very good example of Spielberg in his serious mode despite many flaws in both plot, character, and continuity. 4.5 out of 5. It still isn't the best war movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typed a comment about this before, and now I've had time to rethink it. There is only one major source for my distaste for this movie - Robert Rodat. He trashes almost every country he can when he can except America, which he tries to make out as brilliant and valiant and heroic etc. I mean, where were the other armies at the D-Day landings? It wasn't just the Yanks who landed there! And Monty overrated? Come on Robert! The fact that this guy wrote The Patriot only shows his ignorant Brit-dissing even more. Randall Wallace is another culprit of this super duper pro-American-anti-everyone-else sentiment. I mean in Braveheart the Brits are made out to be totally evil, which is just pure rubbish. Plus he scripted Pearl Harbor, which did its damnedest to make the Americans not look stupid over the attack - the only good movie about Pearl Harbor is Tora! Tora! Tora!, which got it's history correct down to the smallest detail.My major gripe said, this film is gripping from start to finish. The tension really builds up in the landing craft at the start, and the landings really do stun you. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork is a great defining feature of this movie and deservedly won an Oscar. John Williams' score wasn't very apparent, but when it was it was effective enough but rather repetitive. The characters and the moral question behind the story are also well put out to dry, as in why several soldiers for one? And Captain Miller's last words really do express how he felt about going to save Private Ryan.All in all by my reckoning, a half decent war movie that is needlessly pro-American and disses other countries. Mind you, this is probably the main reason it won any Oscars.</fullReview>

To be proud to be able to sit at the picnic table with you're Veteran Grandfather with the American flag waving above you on the 4th of July. To be proud you can stand up and say, because of these men I am free. To be proud to say "I'm an American"! To be proud of your fathers and grandfathers who served for, spilled their blood for, died for, fought for, and loved this country so much! It's a sinning shame people can come here and use such blasphemy and say it's a horrible film. It was well worth my money! I can still remember sitting with my great grandfather so many years ago, listening to his war stories and feeling so proud of him! Then when Saving Private Ryan was in theatres, I took him to see it, and he cried, cried, and cried. All through the movie, it touched his heart that much. It should, if this movie did not touch your heart then you must not have one! But I remember him in the car as I drove him home, smiling as he told me he was proud of Mr. Speilberg, for doing such a wonderfully engaging and real movie. Also to point out, this was NOT a special effects movie, come on, where once in this movie were special effects over used? Hmmm, where? If you can tell me I would be very glad! And to people who say The Matrix was better? think about what you were saying? now then are you so sure anymore? NO!!!! Well then? you see the Matrix was a crappy horrible POS movie that never had any point of ever being made. And I feel disgusted when people tell me how good it was! Combined with a powerful musical score composed by the great John Williams, the admirable film actor Tom Hanks, and top-notch, superlative, unrivalled director Steven Spielberg! They all come together to make one of the greatest films in the last decade, this film is the film people have been waiting many years to see, and when it finally comes to screen people are foolish enough to slur it! Steven Speilberg has a certain essence, a quality, and a god given gift, which is unable to be touched by any other director. Hitchcock just put me to sleep. Kubrick just disgusted me.Okay so maybe five men may not risk their lives to save one man, but it's a touching loving concept that I have to ardor. Thanks for not making some dull mind numbing bacterial crap like Thin Red Line. So basically if you haven't already gathered from previous reviews, SPR is about five men going to save one man. A touching idea to me!This was an excellent piece of American patriotism, courage, and that War is iniquitous and nobody really wins! This is definitely among my top ten including Casablanca, ET, The Patriot, The Green Mile, Rocky, Titanic, Men In Black, CastAway, and Raiders of the Lost Ark! This movie sure as blazes better stand the test of time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was praying for the day when steven spielberg would switch off of autopilot and really put his heart into a movie which is what he did in spades with this movie. i never usually cry during movies but the scene in which the jewish soldier has a knife slowly plunged into his heart by the german soldier is one of the most haunting and unnerving scenes i have ever seen. everything about this film from the editing, acting, and cinematography is top-notch and shows that spielberg could be ranked up there with kubrick if he would just slow down and put his mind and heart into every one of his projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally I saw the picture and actually can not share all the enthusiasm of those sticking an 'movie of the year' label to it; 'cause I can compare. I wish you could see one of war movies made by Russian filmmakers. I believe we have thousands of them and each of them overtops 'Ryan' in sense of movie, in sense of story behind the screen, in sense of tragedy, courage, brotherhood. . Of course, 'Ryan' is the perfectly tailored flick empowered with technically advanced filming and extra-natural guts-wrenching effects to let you practically feel all the disgust of the slaughter. But this is not what makes war so horrible. Unfortunately, 'Ryan' fails to deliver the message. Among movies about WWII this one definitely belongs to 'B' box; it's flat and one-sided. It's like trying to imagine a holiday looking at the resort ad postcard: bright, colorful, rich, exotic.. but tasteless, something you can not touch, feel, enjoy, remember. What we see in 'Ryan' is true but it's not War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years later, the propaganda emerges more clearly. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Saving Private Ryan" in a theatre in its first release, and still watch it five or six times a year, for all sorts of reasons. Eleven years later, I'm starting to know more clearly what I'd like to say about this important film.First, the mastery of cinematic technique shown by Steven Spielberg and his entire production crew is still exciting, and moving to me. A viewer's sense of being on the Normandy beach, panic-stricken in the thick of the chaotic energy, has not been dissipated by ten years of other films' computer effects and three-second jump cuts. The randomness of events, on the beach and after, is a kind of nightmare in a ruined pastoral landscape, and clarifies each soldier's need to withdraw to a sense of what to do, right now, to stay alive - right up to the moment when the impulse to take care of a friend, or a child, overrules common sense and the discipline of self-preservation. Second, though, I'm more saddened every year by the myopic focus on American myth-making which Mr Spielberg embraced. He's made a wholly self-centred film about D-Day, and a generation of moviegoers will never know from this movie that the British, Canadian, Australian, and other Allied troops were landing up and down the French coast at the same moment. The Canadians, in fact, advanced considerably farther inland than the Americans that day, under equally heavy fire. Tom Hank's character mentions British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery leading his troops toward Germany; Ted Danson's character says "That guy's overrated!" and Hanks's character says "No argument from me." That's the total mention of the Allied participation in the invasion, and Montgomery's stature in defeating the Germans in North Africa a year earlier is erased for a whole generation of film goers, even though his excellent leadership in North Africa earned him command of the British troops on June 6th. The omissions, and flip judgments reflect badly on the scriptwriter, and on Mr Spielberg. Third, the halo of sanctity which this film bestows on the members of the special mission has become cloying. The soldiers of this film seem to me to justify an American myth of charming immaturity, and "Saving Private Ryan" dodges completely the documented ways in which American soldiers' unpreparedness during and after the invasion was an acknowledged problem during the last year of the war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge, when American troops collapsed in the face of the German attacks. I'm realising that, for me, "Saving Private Ryan" clashes seriously with the historical record, and that in this sense, it's a meretricious fantasy, however grippingly filmed. I'll still watch it, and feel the adrenaline flow on the beach, below the machine-gun nest, and in front of the bridge, but I won't subscribe to the myths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't claim that Spielberg has overwhelmed me on many an occasion. I tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and up-beat for my world-view. But here, he delivers. The first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to know(and I mean that in the most positive way possible), and few will manage to avoid being pulled in, right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll. The production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest. The direction is spot-on(there's some beautiful underplaying going on here), and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly right(there was perhaps one bit near the end that just? it is not quite there). The pacing is flawless, this never loses your interest(in spite of being close to three hours) nor moves so fast that the audience is lost. The acting is impressive(this thing's got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these), even Mark Vincent(even if he'd prefer we called him Vin Diesel) isn't bad(yeah, I know...I could kick myself, and no thanks, Amy). The realism is an accomplishment; the situations, the reactions, the people, everything, almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing you'd swear someone colorized actual footage or something. There is some Hollywood herein, however, but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity, it's a very, very minor complaint. Cinematography and editing are just amazing... they really bring the scenes to life, and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there. This has got atmosphere to spare. There is a lot of violence and language. The writing is remarkable, and many details are magnificent. The story isn't the most engaging ever in an anti-war film, but it certainly is good. I recommend this to any fan of war movies, just do realize that this holds little back in its depiction. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg adds another masterpiece to his reputation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In another Spielberg masterpiece, a mother is about to receive a message stating that three of her four boys were killed in battle in WWII. The government learns of the fourth Private Ryan (Matt Damon) and declares a search for him to be found and sent home. After invading Normandy on D-Day, Cpt. Miller (Tom Hanks) takes 7 men with him behind enemy lines to search for Ryan.I love this film. It is so well done, interesting to watch, and still great after many repeated viewings. A powerful look into the great war of our time. I feel that this is among the best films of all time.The acting was great by all cast members. I don't recall any missteps and there are certainly spots of fantastic acting in this film. As for the plot, I'm not sure how true it is if even, but I think that it is one of the greatest plots a war film has seen. The action is spectacular and frequents with necessary and brutal war violence. Saving Private Ryan brings the harshness of war to the audience, yet still is entertaining and thought provoking rather than just plain senseless.Furthermore, the visual effects were all great, and I never felt like I was watching a movie so much as that I was there. It definitely gave me that rare thing a film can do every once in a while; allowing to completely be immersed in it.I think that this is among Spielberg's best for sure, and I can highly recommend it as a must see piece of film history.Final Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

I loved all the different stradagies they used in the last battle. The movie makes you like the characters so much it makes you almost cry when they die. I wished more characters could have survived at the end escpesially Captain Miller and Private Jackson. The most suspenseful part by far was when Mellish was upstairs and they hear something in the stairways and they don't know who it is.

		<shortDescription>The best war movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I have younger siblings, most war films I have seen are the least realistic ones that are just fairly decent (Tears of the Sun, Behind Enemy Lines). Upon finally having my siblings out of the house, I was able to watch it. Let me tell you, I was blown away; the movie was incredible.The first thirty minutes are all about D-Day, the bloodiest battle I have ever seen on screen. It was very realistic and accurate; the dead and the wounded were lying around everywhere, getting plowed down as the ships opened. Not too many survived. One of the survivors is one of my all-time favorite actors, Tom Hanks. He is affected by the battle severely, and he recruits men afterward to hunt down Private Ryan, whose other brothers have been killed in combat.The next two hours show us the complete trek to finding Private Ryan and developing all the characters to their fullest. Every character has his own personality, and you learn so much about each and every character. Each one does a great job at showing what type of person they are. Along the way, they have to fight off some Nazis and two men are killed. This effects each and every soldier in Tom Hank's squadron, and the life of war is seen taking its toll on each man, emotionally and mentally breaking them and hurting them.Every time a character has a meltdown, it is very powerful. The moments are calm and slow, but not soft on the heart. And yet they must press on through the washed-up world until they find Private Ryan and have a historic showdown in cinema history.Heroes die. Men are wounded and left for dead. Only some survive. The final battle is merciless and although not as bloody as the D-Day Invasion in the beginning, its more difficult to watch because more men die and you know each and every one. What makes it even sadder is that it was all real.Even my Grandpa, who was in several battles in the Korean War and held as a prisoner for two years in Korea, said the movie was fairly realistic. Steven Spielberg, cinematic genius of the 20th Century, is not afraid to show the blood and gore and hammer disturbingly devastating pain into the hearts of the viewer. And after the movie you find yourself silent, quietly honoring the heroes of WWII. That is what Saving Private Ryan did. 9.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hollywood war film tradition, epic warfare orbits on the actions of already acquainted heroes. In Steven Spielberg's judicial and exacting masterwork, thousands of horror-struck and nauseated men, most of them green to battle, are chucked into the grimace of devastating German fire. The opening sequence is as detailed as any war footage. In the blood-soaked opening steps, the landing forces and the enemy never connect eye to eye, but are just faceless clots of men who have been commanded to shoot at one another until one side is overwhelmed.Spielberg's camera makes no comprehension of the engagement. That is the function of his approach. For the individual soldier on the beach, the landing was a cacophony of clamor, sludge, gore, entrails and morbidity. The scene is filled with various nongermane fragments of chronology, as when a soldier has his arm blown off.This landing sequence is essential to form the remoteness between those who give the order that Pvt. Ryan be saved, and those who are dictated to do the saving. For Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, the landing at Omaha has been a melting pot of crossfire. For the Army Chief in his Washington office, war feels more secluded and nationalistic. His advisors doubt the judgment and even the plausibility of a mission to save Ryan. That sets up the second act of the film, in which Miller and his men infiltrate spryly inflamed French terrain, while entertaining defiant ideas about the prudence of the assignment. All of Miller's men have served with him before, save for Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), the translator, who speaks excellent German and French but has never fired a rifle in rage and is frightened nearly to the point of his morality's deterioration. The war was fought by civilians just like him, whose lives had not readied them for the brass tacks of combat.Steven Spielberg is often thought of as a throwaway name to refer to when speaking of the greatest directors of all time, mainly because his movies are often romanticized, Hollywood blockbusters and not hard, tough, cool grungy stuff. Spielberg, while he demonstrates a mastery of pace and story crescendo that should be taught in every film school in the world, proves with Saving Private Ryan, not to mention with the more recent Munich, that he is capable of true grit and shocking realism.The story begins with the most gut-wrenchingly violent battle scene I've seen in any war film. This prolonged sequence depicts D-Day in the most realistic possible way, not only with gore and violence but also with the ambient violence that must be dealt with in moments of hasty contemplation and desperate but emotionally diluted dialogue. The film then segues into a story that applies the deeply affecting theme of the mother. What makes the film so profound is its core drawing of sympathy from the audience for the common boy's mother and the pain and worry they endure in times of war that we can only imagine.His cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who also shot Schindler's List, brings a newsreel texture to a lot of the footage, but that's rather elementary next to his most substantial stroke, which is to make everything manifest lucid. Following the meticulous pandemonium of the landing scenes, Kaminski handles the attack on the machine gun nest, and an extensive climax concerning the fortification of a bridge, in a way that keeps us aligned. It's not simply men shooting at one another. We learn the plan of the action, the subtle victory of optimism over despair, the spontaneity, the corresponding locations of the soldiers.Hanks has a subtle sense of drama in his personal commitment to the role of Capt. Miller, an English teacher who has outlived ordeals so overwhelming that he doubts if his wife will even place him. With a reserved, collected, and even exacting bearing, his hands nonetheless quiver. He is on the verge of breakdown, but he does his best since that is his duty. All of the actors, all the countless noteworthy faces, playing the men under him are compelling, somewhat on account of Spielberg defying the inducement to make them stereotypical caricatures in the custom of WWII movies, and makes them emphatically everyday.Everything approaches the third act, when Private Ryan is found, and the soldiers determine what to do next. Spielberg and his screenwriter, Robert Rodat, have done a penetrating and personally transcendent thing: They have made a philosophical film about war in effect thoroughly in circumstances of action. Their sweeping ode says things about war that are as intricate and demanding as any essayist could likely assert, and does it with expansive, forceful imagery, with brutality, with coarseness, with movement, with rapport. It is conceivable to get across even the most sensitive notions in the most elementary words and actions, and that's what Spielberg does with keen instincts, because he signifies his impressions in visceral reactions, not words. Steven Spielberg is as technically accomplished as any filmmaker alive, and due to his mammoth eminence, he has admittance to any asset he entails. Both of those facts are relevant to the punch of this seamless period piece. He knows how to express his emotional fervor about men in combat with utmost moralistic intensity, and he has the apparatus, the greenback and the running dogs to make it happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts and ends with the American flag, this could be a sufficient analysis of the movie really. Its a quite(by Hollywood) well preserved myth that the "D-day" has got any real historical meaning. The Thousenths Americans and British that died on the shores of Normandy should of course be remembered. But historical facts should as well be remembered. Spielberg wants to show us how USA fought for freedom against fascist Germany failing to even mention the victories of the soviet-union on the easter front in Stalingrad (a victory that by the way cost about 20 million Russian deaths since they were fighting the majority of the German troops). A movie about the history is never about the history. Its about the present day. During the making of this film American airplanes where bombing civilians in Jugoslavia. Of course they appointed Milosevic to be "the new Hitler" before it all started. A little propaganda is never wrong. Take a good look on the movies about the world war(s) since the 40:s. There is a very distinguished change from time to time. Very much depending on what roll USA wishes to take in the world. Notice as well that there are no black people in the picture. This is because it was forbidden for blacks and whites to be in the same plutone(excuse my spelling) until the 60:s(When they needed black cannon fodder in Vietnam). Thats a could way to fight fascism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece of War Movies **May contain spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and for good reason. When released on video several years ago, I watched about the first 5 minutes and turned away, with no stomach for the blood and graphic violence in the opening scene...with the release of the special edition DVD and it's reasonable price and many accolades, I had to buy it to add to my collection. And am I glad I did. First Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks were absolutely superb as director and actor, respectively. No one in tinseltown could have done a better job with a war movie. And Spielber's objective was met with me anyway....know why we celebrate "Memorial Day" and "Veterans Day"...this movie will explain why... The cinematography in this film won the Oscar and rightly so!! I watched the special features and Spielberg stated he extracted something like 60% of the color to allow for more of a dated type film appearance, to look like footage....and it worked...it made the movie so much more believable...and bring you to the time and place and the horrors of war and heroes we hear about but never meet. The viewer is spared no brutality, no violence of war...it's frightening but gripping, hard to watch but also hard to look away....There are many tearful moments in this movie, so it's definitely a "have a tissue nearby" film. Sad, poignant, profound moments that (if you're human i.e. compassionate) will force you, however subliminally to remember what honoring our fallen heroes and the survivors of war is all about. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg will bring you into the lives of the soldiers of WWII. And this movie should awaken the viewer who sees it now to the honor that our soldiers from any way, whether it's WWI, WWII, Vietnam (especially) and now Iraq, DESERVE to be honored for their losses..for they're lack of tomorrows are for our todays!A 10/10!! Kudos to Spielberg! This will join the movie classics of all time!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best war movies that I have ever seen. It had a wonderful plot and was based on a true story. It not only entertains us it also gives us a small history lesson: What the war was like How many people gave their lives to save this country The weapons that they used All in all I would give this movie a Ten out of Ten and proclaim it the best war movie ever. Also the actual way they fought back then was very interesting. Like the last scene in the movie, when they fought the Germans to keep a hold of the bridge that they were protecting. Even the character that were fictional appeared to have real lives and actually participate in the war. There was only one thing that I did not like and it was not enough to bring my vote down from a ten, and it was the fact that some of the lines that they used were a little bit crummy. "O my god they shot me" while he was still moving, first scene of the movie. This was one of about three lines that I really do not believe should have been included in the final script. Otherwise this was still the best movie that I have ever seen in my entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a typical example of the wrong conception that the big money and a serious theme make a great art. No matter how important and serious is the problem of the film, nothing will save it if it is made without taste. Spielberg goes on making dull, pretentious, unbearably politically correct films for adults with a teenage level of intellect. Well, there is nothing bad in making naive picture but naivety of Spielberg Films is of a special kind. It seems that the director wants to make something more important than ET or Indiana Jones but, actually these are his best films, because they are what they are __ nice, entertaining films for kids. When Spielberg aspires for something higher he inevitably finishes with a huge, monumental soap.Unlike Shindlers List that I consider a good educational film for youth, Private Ryan has something that I, citizen of a post-communist (post-totalitarian) country cannot accept. America used to be for us a symbol of democracy, and it is strange that now when there is no Soviet danger anymore, American cinema is becoming more and more conservative and hurrah-patriotic. Of course there is nothing bad in being a patriot of your nation but the latest tendency is obviously aimed at propagating the armed forces, militarism, etc. From this point of view there is not much difference between the Private Rayan and the Independence Day. Spielbergs films doesn't seem to show that much of senselessness of war (as it was advertised), but propagates the bravery of the American soldiers and the wisdom of the American regime, and does this as straightforward and primitive as it can be. The story of the film seems pathetic (even if it is true), and the acting is corresponding, good photography and excellent sound effects cannot save the film. I think it is time for some filmmakers to realize that no matter how important and serious is the problem of film; nothing will save it if it is made without taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unjustifiable exploitation film masquerading as "art"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if this film had been made exactly as it is seen today by someone other than Steven Spielberg? What would the critics be saying? I have a feeling they would be telling the screenwriter to go back to college and learn about dialogue, story thrust, plausibility, and characterization - four things that this awful, exploitive drivel singularly lacked. I feel they would also be telling the director that if you open a film with 40 minutes of sickening violence that you had better be prepared to justify it later on. The most disheartening thing about all of this is that Spielberg no longer seems to care what his films are saying, only that they make a big enough noise to be "important". Following the unwatchable opening, we get extremely trite symbolism, poor dialogue, and wooden acting in service of a badly presented story, all leading up to another unwatchable sequence, followed by a coda which suggests that all of this unnecessary carnage is a great, noble, and patriotic thing. In doing this, Spielberg aligns himself with the Nazis that his own "Schindler's List" abhorred....remember, the Nazis were the kings of patriotism and nationalism. The most offensive aspect of this film, then, is its utter pretentiousness. At least exploitation movies don't pretend to be anything but what they are. This one, sadly, has delusions of grandeur (and although this criticism can't be levelled at the film itself, Spielberg's utterly arrogant acceptance of his Oscar for best director confirms all of my worst suspicions - compare it to his humble, tearful acceptance of the well-deserved Oscars for "Schindler's List"). Since no one around Mr. Spielberg seems to have the courage necessary to tell him when the emperor has no clothes on, the responsibility falls to the critics and audiences. Let him know you're tired of his version of "reality".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to see this movie,upon its release.When I sat there watching it I was surprised at the brutality of it.That was however,the best part of the movie.Other the honesty of the way the battle scenes were shot,the story was lame.I had a hard time believing that the life of one soldier was so important.So important in fact,that the lives a a few soldiers are risked in saving him.And when they do find him its just more of the same brutal fight scenes.Looks good but as a whole movie was bitterly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually quite mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice battle scenes, but the plot is actually unrealistic - just ask a veteran. During the largest invasion in the history of the human race, no commanders were worried about individual men. No squads sauntered through enemy territory talking loudly and generally acting like big targets. If the dialogue and the acting were better, I could overlook the flaws, but Matt Damon in particular is rank. For a real, true to life war movie, watch A Bridge Too Far; no Hollywoodization there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible excuse for a war movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this first came out, everyone jumped up and danced around about how good it was. Critics said it was incredibly powerful and it redefinned the war movie. They claimed it was nothing like those patriotic films right after world war two. Nor was it like the many excellent films made during the 70s and 80s on Vietnam. It was so different and so much better. I completely disagree. If anything, it is a throwback to all those Gung-Ho films like "The Sands of Iwo Jima". It really makes one want to join the fight and help save Europe. And it is quite funny. Not only is there humour when they are marching around looking for Private Ryan (which is acceptable), but you also laugh when people are dying. That shouldn't happen in a quality war movie. It can in an action movie on the other hand. Another thing, the ending is absolutely ridiculous, like that would happen. I must commend Spielberg for his excellent direction of the landings and the action sequences were staged well, but this is no great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War Movie That Adds Nothing to the War Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great things about seeing a film twice is that it allows you to go back and see the flaws that flew right on past you the first time you saw it. When I first viewed "Saving Private Ryan", I enjoyed the film, but at the time I didn't really think about why. I walked out of the screening not really thinking about the film at all. First bad sign! Later on, at home, I began to think about the impact that "Saving Private Ryan" had on me. I started to feel as though the film had no impact on me what so ever. Second bad sign! How could this be? How could a film acclaimed by so many as one of the best war films ever made, have no effect on me? So, in a couple of days, I went and watched it again and then everything became clear. "Saving Private Ryan" is Steven Spielberg through and through. When I first saw the film, I had thought that Spielberg had risen above the many poor works of his past, but I was dead wrong.Steven Spielberg is a master at pulling the wool over the eyes over his momentous audience. He made many of us feel that we really needed another epic WWII film, such as what he has created. He has done the same thing with other films such as "Schindler's List" and "Amistad". While I admire "Schindler's List" for its historical merits and its importance of topic, I hardly regard it as the high form of cinematic art that so many have claimed it to be. My opinion of "Saving Private Ryan" does not change too much from this.The film does nothing to add to the war genre. Much of it is a regeneration of older, and much better war films. Not only this, "Saving Private Ryan" blatantly contradicts itself. The film is obviously meant to be perceived as an anti-war film. I suspect that Spielberg would not have filmed the opening battle scene in the manner he did, if it wasn't. No doubt, most people will see this as an anti-war film, but is it really? I think not. If a film is to be truly ant-war, then there can be no redeeming qualities of war. This means that war can not be seen as heroic or patriotic. How many times was there a flash of the American flag over the entirety to the screen? I can not remember, but if it was five, then it was five too many. There is an overwhelming question in the film. Was it really worth it to go to the trouble of saving Private Ryan (Matt Damon)? Of course, in light of the fact that the majority of the Hollywood audience is intolerant of ambiguity, they answer this question. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is to be seen as an American hero for the mission that he and his squad accomplished. This does not sound like anti-war to me. In great war films like "Paths of Glory" and "Full Metal Jacket", there are no heroes that transpire from battle at the end. There are no redeeming qualities illustrated at all. In these films, war is depicted as ugly, inhumane, alienating, and just plain wrong.The opening battle sequence which lasts for about 30 minutes is wonderful in its brutal realism and its leads us into thinking that we are about to experience a truly harrowing war picture. In fact, this is one of the best sequences that I have seen on film, and the movie is worth seeing just for the one scene. We, the audience really feel as if we are in the midst of this highly violent and bloody battle at Normandy. The sound quality and the visuals are immaculate. The camera seems to take on a role of its own. It seems to be ducking behind objects to avoid being hit by bullets, just as the rest of the soldiers are. The entire scene is shot with the hand held camera, with jerky, and often disorienting movements, adding to the chaos of the battle.Unfortunately, the rest of "Saving Private Ryan" isn't as well made as this first scene. The battle scene near the end of the film feels like something out of an action movie. It has the same effect as an action sequence from one of the "Die Hard" movies in that it thrills us with its fast-paced shootouts and numerous explosions. I found myself not caring who was killed and who wasn't. It felt like cartoon violence. I enjoyed watching the sequence for this reason. It came no where close to having the same impact as the opening battle.While I recommend seeing "Saving Private Ryan" for the technical merit of the opening battle, problems continuously present themselves throughout the rest of the film. It contradicts its anti-war presence. The ending is summed up to nicely. Leaving the end more ambiguous would have been effective at least in terms of provoking thought. My strongest objection to the film is its sinking to the level of an action picture at the climax. This is not something that I wanted in a film of this scale. "Saving Private Ryan" leaps to a great start, but ends up not having the endurance to make it to the finish line as a winner. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Change after 30 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend seeing this movie at the theatres...then seeing another movie after the first thirty minutes is over. The first thirty minutes was all of the balls that this movie had. After the grisly scene, Spielberg castrates this movie. The movie was too long for its own good.First, the 20-second intro and finale. These were the most emotional scenes of the whole movie. They brought tears to my eyes, seeing all of the soldiers that died in the wars for this country. That is what the crosses were, and it was in a national cemetary, probably Arlington. These were two of the three most sad moments of the movie.Second: the thirty-minute D-day battle. This was the other emotional moment of the movie. This is the only time that I disagree in that I thought that the movie was very realistic. I was depressed by it, and saddened. Especially when one soldier picks up his arm. The use of sound, visuals, and effects were outstanding for this portion of the movie. It depressed me.Third: the rest of the movie. It SUCKED. I was bored to tears, that is why it is depressing. I sat there, and sat there, and sat there waiting for something intellectual to come up and at least slap me. No, I do not think that the dilemma of trying to rescue one soldier is intellectual, I think it is STUPID. It did not show any realities, and I did not want to go along, and it just was pure crap. This is very superficial, and I felt that I should have probably cared about the people, but I DID NOT. This ruined the end of the movie because I was so bored, that I did not notice the violence all that much in the last scene, and was only a little moved by the crosses reappearing.I give this movie a four because it did not try. It is just as fluffy as "Shakespeare In Love," which also did not deserve to win. I must highly recommend "The Thin Red Line" because it makes you think for yourselves, instead of trying to force you to think "THERE. THIS IS BAD. CRY. BE HAPPY. FEEL THIS." My response to these movies is "I'm not stupid, don't insult me. Let me make my own judgement." If you want oscar-calibur movies go see "Elizabeth," or "The Thin Red Line." Also, "Life Is Beautiful" is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperately violent and grossly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the heart-rending scene in "Titanic" where the mother is telling a story to her two doomed children in bed as the ship is going down? If Spielberg had made "Titanic", we would have been treated to the sight of the mother and children sucking in salt water and slowly drowning. And movie-goers would be saying, "Well, that's the way it really was! Why pull punches?" So in "Saving Private Ryan", we're subjected to people exploding and being decapitated as a substitute for real drama.Spielberg personifies the philosophy, "If you CAN show it, you MUST show it". Show it he does - the violence, that is. But if you really want to get an idea of why these men were able to rise to heroic levels, or if you want to return to that time in our nation's history and meet those people, get to know and understand those people, this just ain't the movie.But if you want an incredible amount of action (did any one soldier ever see so much action?) then this is the movie for you. Great special effects, almost all of which were put to use showing how bullets penetrate bodies and rip limbs off.Recommendation: Go rent "The Big Red One", made in 1980. It communicates the horror of war by humanizing the participants. The closing scene showing the soldiers clearing out the remnants of a concentration camp is a miniature masterpiece. And not one person's head has to explode to get us to understand the violence perpetrated by men against men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit I'm a little bit boggled by all of the acclaim this film has gotten. There isn't anything innovative or original about it, and it is seriously marred by Spielberg's tendency to pander to his audience. Do we really need the framing device in which we see the sad old man in the cemetary? This is such a blatant effort to pull on heartsrings that I found myself resisting the movie on an emotional level.I also couldn't believe the scene in which Private Ryan is located. This scene was totally out of place, in terms of both plot and tone. It is a superfluous scene, and the feeble attempt at humor is distracting. I don't need a "Three's Company" style misunderstanding in the midst of a serious war film. Why does Spielberg have to sugarcoat everything? Is he afraid that if he doesn't provide some comic relief the audience will be put off?And consider the scene in which Matt Damon relates a childhood story about his brothers. As he tells the story it grows more and more implausible, and less and less funny, until finally the whole thing collapses under its own weight. This is a perfect example of a scene that could have been highly emotional if it weren't damaged by astonishingly bad writing. In an attempt to create yet another maudlin, three-hanky moment, the filmmakers failed to realize that the scene just plain doesn't work.Another problem is the characters. I was especially disappointed by the portrayal of the German soldiers, who are seen only as The Enemy. It's too bad that we weren't allowed to see them as three-dimensional human beings. I'll bet that somewhere on the German side there's a counterpart to the Jeremy Davies character, someone overwhelmed by the senselessness and cruelty of battle.Most of this would be forgivable if we had some innovative film technique to distract us. We don't. The most interesting visual element of the film is the shaky hand-held camera in the opening battle. But this technique has already been used a number of times, most notably in "G.I. Jane" a year earlier. As for the rest of the film, I'll admit that the battle scenes were competently directed. But competent is all they are. Spielberg doesn't display anything near the technical skill of, say, Stanley Kubrick in the sniper scene of "Full Metal Jacket"."Saving Private Ryan" is being acclaimed as a masterpiece, but if you want to see a truly sensitive, intelligent war movie, see "The Thin Red Line" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst war movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody who has studied WW2 just for a while and knows some basic facts about it can not like this film. The plot doesn't make any sense. Sacrifice the whole "rescue" unit for sake of one's paratrooper's life? Seriously? Stop pretending to be noble here and answer a simple question: "Is a search for one man (not rescue exactly) worth risking lives of a whole squad?" Furthermore, how can someone expect of a small unit, which consists of bunch of infantrymen, to find one man in such a vast area? There was a big mess after attack of allied paras. They were spread all over the place with heavy loses. Some reviewer wrote here the idea to call 101st on radio to pull Ryan back. I think that would be the best thing to do.This movie is unbelievably insulting. The Germans are portrayed way too cartoonish like blood-thirsty animals (Americans are the good guys of course) and completely inept enemy at the same time, which of course wasn't true in most cases. The Germans were a tough enemy in spite of the fact that most of their soldiers were not equipped and trained well as in the earlier years. What all of you people who think the portrayal of Germans in this movie is realistic is the reason the war lasted so long?! Just bad luck and weather? No way. Some reviewers wrote that there is nothing stupid about Germans here because they made mistakes like slow reaction to the D-day or wrong estimation of the invasion's spot. That is true but it has nothing to do with quality of individual soldiers. That is not a justification for showing elite units including SS panzer gruppen as complete idiots!The American saviors were just refusing to die each time a shootout emerged. Yes, they were killed finally but should be dead much earlier. You are supposed to sympathize with our bunch of American action characters but I just hated everyone of them. Spielberg wants us to think that they are battle hardened soldiers, but I had the feeling they are just kids playing some war game (except for the interpreter, who was totally unnecessary character btw., acting annoyingly cowardly for no reason in the whole movie). I was bored for most of the time after the first sequence. The way the unit moves behind enemy lines looks like a walk in Central Park. One German with machine gun in the right position could easily wipe out at least half of the unit because they didn't keep any type of formation which should have prevent this.The final scene is so incredibly stupid that I doubt about common sense of those who spoke well about this one. You see German attackers running back and forth without covering fire or support in front of American barrels! Germans even don't try to find any kind of cover!! They even hardly return any fire!!! It's like shooting range for American soldiers or some kind of PC game. Looks like every dead American takes at least 100 Germans to hell with him. Kids, if you like this sequence, I have bad news for you. The war doesn't look like this. You hardly see anything more than enemy soldier's head and his gun when combat occurs and of course the kills are not so easy to get. On the other hand the Americans also run uncovered many times but with some ability to dodge bullets or something like that. That is the only explanation of my own for their immortality. In reality they would have been killed instantly if they would behave in such way as shown in this sequence, for example running in front of PzKpfw tiger which has manually operated machine gun at the front. The rules which apply to Germans somehow don't apply to Americans. The tactics performed by both allies and axis here is laughable. Germans wouldn't enter a town with tanks ahead and infantry behind them because the tanks are vulnerable in urban areas. Their strength is placed in the open. The attack on the radar station is weird as well. The defenders were surely part of a bigger group. It is obvious that after killing the defenders the Americans should retire using "Hit and run" tactics because other Germans could enter a fight. Instead of it, they argue on the very spot they've just captured about a sense of their mission like there is nothing to worry about (it would have been clear to an orangutan from a very beginning that this mission sucks). Just stupid. I could go on like this and mention for example shooting 7 shots from 5 round rifle without reloading and so on but I will skip it. You cannot let this so called war movie treat with history like this. Call it action B movie and I'm gonna take it. Never watch this crap if you like history and portrayal of it in the way it actually happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times. But it deserves to be in the top 250, really it is that good! Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Everything about this film was spectacular...The realism, the plot, the production value, the acting..etc all amazing. The characters are all unique and likable..with the exception of Upham(AKA the good guy you hate more than the bad guys) Several reasons for this: He's idiotic and doesn't understand war, he talks all this "humanity, and what's right BS," but when it's time to kill an enemy easily and save a fellow comrad, he's too much of a coward. He also fails in the field because he was cowardice..Though he finally shot someone, it proved useless..it only said he was willing to kill, but kill an unarmed person at point blank.(which ironically makes him more of a coward.) Other than that all characters are cool. The mysterious Miller, the tough guy Carparzo, the jolly Harvath, the defiant Reiban, the great medic Wade, the great yet unfortunate Mellish, and my personal favorite, the cool religious sniper, Daniel Jackson. You can't help but fall into the story..I mean everything is done so exceptionally, it's no wonder why this is remembered as an all-time great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>throwback to old war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a throwback to old war movies, make no mistake. We have an identifiable group of men (eight of them), who go on a mission. This one is to risk their lives to save one man. Its based upon the story of the Sullivans, a group of brothers who all died, and the Department of Defense decided it was time to act so that not all of a family would perish in war. The Sullivans served together on the same ship (The Indianaplois), and perished. Of course if they had lived, they probably would have just moved to the East coast, had their own ship, go hunting for a giant shark, and made fun of college kids, then get eaten by a shark any way. So these eight soldiers look for Private Ryan, the last of his family, and are to make him return home. Along the way, they suffer casualties. There isn't a lot of new material here. A lot has been made of the gore, but even the old films had gore to equal or outdo this. Old World War Two films didn't hesitate to have men lose their legs when tanks would run over and amputate them, or to be horribly disfigured. So there is nothing new. The action comes in bits and pieces until a big fight in the end. Some of it looks a little too contrived, to be honest, as though the director was aiming at some conclusion with all the little conclusions coming first. True to old time movies, minor characters die first, and also true to old time movies, men from New York and cigarette smokers get a free pass and cannot be killed, so you know some who will survive. Just a little too trite and Hollywood to be recommended, but not a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think this film is not as good as its hyped up to me. Yes it might be realistic, but as a film, I've seen better, with deeper meanings and understandings. I hear people say this is the best war film ever made! In comparison to films such as apocalypse now, full metal jacket, paths of glory, even Platoon there is no contest in my opinion. This film is about the soldiers, and what they had to put up with, which any person will feel for, however the films I have mentioned above have more depth, and discuss more important issues, with greater subtleties (in some cases) and take into account the "grand scheme of things". Comparing this film with "Full Metal Jacket" also is an example of the difference between a "Hollywood" director like Spielberg who directed E.T, Indiana Jones, Jaws and Kubrick who directed A clockwork orange, 2001 and Dr Strangelove. Don't get me wrong i loved Indiana Jones, E.T. and Jaws, but when I compare these films with the Kubrick ones, I see a major difference(with the exception of Shindlers List). However good these films are, they are simple stories, whereas Kubrick tackled bigger issues. Saving Private Ryan is not a simple story, but it asks for sympathy, and rightly so, but that is all it does for me. What I would like to say is that the opening battle scenes are remarkable. I am someone who believes in being only one or two, if that really good films a year. I did not think this was one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in a tight knit Italian family, my father and several close uncles who all saw action in the Second World War, in fact when I was born my father was in Europe fighting. They were in the Marines, Army, Navy and one in the 101 airborne. Although none of them would speak of what they saw and did in any great detail, as they grew older they would from time to time discuss little bits and pieces. I can tell you from what I gleaned from their various conversations and having seen just about every war movie, "Saving Private Ryan" is as close as we privileged citizens are ever going to get to what it was really like. However, I believe it reality it was worse, yes worse than movie could make it. Remember, this was a 3 hour movie showing one incident, the reality is far worse, as the survivors of each incident did not go home, they got to fight again the next day/week/month/year, and so on, until the war was won of you were killed or wounded. The greatest generation, you bet. They made the world free, they did give up their tomorrows so we could have ours. If you don't agree and therefore do not honer, remember and celebrate these REAL American hero's, Than I say KMA and drop dead you UN-American SOB and go back to whatever hole you came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fate of Rebels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing it again, nine years after its release, you can't help being struck by how familiar things are: the pale blue cast of the photography, the distinctive special effects, the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit, the clank of bullet against armor, the shaky camera, the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield, the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt, the attention to period detail, the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward moments.All of this is familiar now because it's been so often aped, often in strong films like "Band of Brothers" and "Blackhawk Down". I doubt that anyone could make an "ordinary" war film anymore. Slow, cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like "Platoon." If you're going to make a war movie now, Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is the bogie you have to match. It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies.And what an innovation this movie was. Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years, because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated. If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags, tinkling a little bell, and crying "Unclean, unclean." "Saving Private Ryan"'s subject is less controversial. First, the enemy really WAS our enemy. (Germany declared war on the USA first, not the other way around.) Second, well -- we won, didn't we? But it is probably more original in its details. And candid too. A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict, and the German wins! And not by cheating either! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest. He does not gloat or smile. It's no tennis game to the German, but a deadly necessity, just as it is for the American soldier. "Relax," the German pants in a low voice, "it's very simple," as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest. The scene is phenomenally stark.The most complex character is Upham's. The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles, performing impossible feats of bravery. This is precisely what the Germans are doing too. But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies. The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character, but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes. He translated, was almost run over by a tank, ran across open spaces under fire, and carried ammunition. But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side, only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility, a fundamental mammalian trait which -- not having been in Upham's place ourselves -- we can condemn him for.Maybe nobody can define an "anti-war movie." They ALL claim to be anti-war movies. How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation? To many people, an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood. Put Steven Segal in combat boots. Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line. But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win, as indeed we do in "Saving Private Ryan". (The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue.) All war movies, even those depicting a "defeat" like Pearl Harbor, seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan: "No matter how sneaky or noble they may be, they can't whip us." I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage -- in Hollywood -- to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy. It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as "A Bridge Too Far." And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in "Saving Private Ryan." That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives. What? We LOSE? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through "Psycho." Don't miss "Saving Private Ryan," a milestone at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable War Movie with a Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A close Russian friend, a one-time tank commander, made me think seriously about this movie. He said, "The first 20 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' make all other war movies look foolish." He then continued, "For example, that Hollywood movie 'Memphis Belle' is so silly." Well, I happen to think 'Memphis Belle' is a good movie. And I must say that Spielberg copied the "Hollywood" war-movie style of Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove".Technical issues or even realism aside, the underlying message of "Saving Private Ryan" is so strong, so well-put, and so human, that in my view it defies objection. I have wandered too many war cemeteries to think otherwise. "All Quiet on the Western Front" is also a good war movie but it makes the case for pacifism. The basic message of "Saving Private Ryan" is not pacifist at all. It's something else altogether. But I suggest you see it and draw your own conclusions.Lastly, "Saving Private Ryan" is so well-made that it bears repeated viewings. But if you dislike war movies, then you should still watch this movie once, if only for the message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is one of Spielberg's greatest masterpieces and I loved it. It affected me like no other war film since "Apocalypse Now" which is saying something. Spielberg always makes great war films, and this is his best yet (he also won his second Oscar for his direction). With violent (yet necessary) war sequences (photographed by Oscar winner Kaminski) and some better than average acting by Tom Hanks and a great cast, this film will make you think twice about World War 2. The Best Film of 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a line, however fine, between cinematic masterpiece and good filmmaking. Though I believe "Private Ryan" is neither, I would definitely place it in mediocre standing towards the latter category. It is a questionably solid example of a type of filmmaking known as realism; that is, "what" is more important than "how." Notice the lack of character development and the absence of closeness with organized plot. Most movies today, whether they be masterpieces or not, are at least cinematic. "Private Ryan" should not have been marketed like these other films. It is not cohesive, nor is it engaging. It is meant to shock us into believing that this is how it was in WWII. Therein lies it's merit. Spielberg should have promoted it this way: "My film is a realistic recreation of difficult and dramatic events, not a 'flick.'" He should have shown it in art houses and college classrooms. I wish that I could say his isolated attempt to engage audiences with realism was precise, but alas, I must also note that Speilberg's idea of realism is off-base. The movie, to me, seemed technically poor in some spots with inconsistent lighting and obvious computer manipulation. However, the real problem with the format of the film lies in it's breaches of realism. We get glimpses of character analysis with the very plastic opening and ending scenes in the cemetery. In addition, the inner scene in a crumbling old church (beautiful images out of place) where the young medic remembers his mother, lets us journey far too deeply within the mind and soul for realism. On a more positive note, the acting was superb all around. If Speilberg has accomplished anything with "Private Ryan," he has revealed the strengths of some outstanding young actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving film, although from the usual US-saves-the-world perspective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an addendum to the very fair report on SPR by Bob the Moo, I'd only point out that the basis for the story is not an American one, but a British one from WWI. That's the only nod to the usual US view of themselves as the world's favourite saviours. That said, it's a great film. The deaths, especially as a result of close-quarter combat, are rightly harrowing. You do get the sense that war is not about glory and that heroic actions often go unrecorded, often resulting in tragic endings. The attempt at combat realism is commendable; the sound of machine gun bullets zipping through air and flesh will remain with me. In an action film there is often limited scope for developing depth to the characters, and this is also true of SPR. To blame any of the actors for this is a tad unfair. It simply soars way over the heads of such films as Full Metal Jacket and the closest comparison I could make is to the Band Of Brothers series, which is closely based on real events, and possibly The Wind Whisperers. Oh, and regarding the comment about Michael Caine removing his kids from a US school over it teaching that WWII began in 1941: It is sad but true that US kids might be taught this; however, are Brit kids taught that WWII began on 3rd Sept 1939? To a Pole, the war began 2 days prior to that. To a Czech, maybe a year, to a Chinese person maybe 3 years... it's all a matter of perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some very good things about this film, unfortunately there are also some very bad things that detract from it as a whole.First the good news:The action sequences at the beginning and end of this film are second to none - War is not "Heck" but something entirely more horrific. There were some nice little touches such as Miller having Parkinsons that added some colour to the characterisation.Now the bad news:There were far too many formulaic elements in this film - I would like to think this was enforced by the studios but I doubt it.The German they let go and what happens afterward with him - extremely predictable.The Rookie that goes to pieces at completely the worst time - equally soThe sequence where Miller is firing at the Tank with his sidearm - we're in Cliche country.The ending (From after above scene onward) - Far too jingoistic for my taste - the Film tries to show how repulsive war is, then tries to glorify it?? This particularly cheapens the entire movie.Saving Private Ryan is great to look at, and will hopefully open a lot of people's eyes as to what being shot or blown up actually looks like in "Reality", but with a sharper script and a less cynical template, it could have been a lot better.Dan</fullReview>

A movie that starts and ends with the US flag is likely to put non-American viewers off side. It would appear that the only people involved in World War II were the Americans, a few cowed and unimportant French peasants and pantomime German villains. A psychiatrist friend of mine assures me that this movie is a classic illustration of the isolation caused by post traumatic stress disorder, but her husband agrees with me that the movie is just rubbish.

		<shortDescription>Not realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very clear to me that Mr. Spielburg has never fought in a war situation. The film did not depict D Day as it was at that time. It is clearly relating to the turn of the century, and would be seen as such.Many will think that its success is because it is purely a US affair. I thought there were about 16 countries involved, including the defense team. The battle scenes are over dramatized, and no one seems to keep their heads down to avoid being shot, especially the Germans. Also, as usual, the Germans are depicted as being cowardly, stupid and "not obeying the rules". The whole film is an exercise in American patriotism, as told in American schools. If you must see an American war movie that is realistic, watch Task Force, which is a much more accurate depiction of war. Also, it depicts the Americans getting the worst deal on D Day. Not true. The Germans did.This film is sometimes chosen as the greatest ever. Not by me. I would dearly love to know if these voting systems are stacked.</fullReview>

I think the director could have made more of a visual impact if he had used one of his old camcorders. In fact, I've seen student films that have crisper and more defined images. It is obvious, that for the subject nature of this film, the filmmaking was totally incompetent. I expected so much more from such a good director as Steven Spielberg.

This movie is nearly tree hours but seems nowhere near that long.The performances are all very good with fine memorable characters and the only jarring note for me was at the end when the captain tells Ryan to Earn this. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I felt that it put an awful burden on Ryan who would have been haunted by the fact that all these soldiers had died to save him, especially when he didn't want to be saved.Other than that it is an excellent way to spend a few hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking and Extraordinary...Ultimate War Depiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the review on the title page that recommended watching this film with a surround sound system to make watching this film an astounding experience. I took the advice of this reviewer and I thank him, the sound quality was mind-blowing and captivated me for the 162 minute running time. However, this brutally realistic depiction of combat is an astounding experience regardless of surround systems.The film follows a group of soldiers of the 2nd Ranger Batallion who valiantly agree to tackle a brutal mission where the subject is a young trooper by the name of James Francis Ryan who unknowingly as lost his 3 brothers in combat. After his mother receives the news, the chief of staff of the U.S army orders the Generals to inform Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) that he is to locate Private Ryan and release from his duties in combat in order for him to return safely to his grieving mother.The film follows the group of soldiers as they go to extraordinary lengths in order to 'Save Private Ryan' which involves the death of two soldier's, the medic Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), along with the massacre of a number of German and French troops. After the soldiers locate their subject, they break the news to him and despite understandably being crippled with grief, Private Ryan displays extreme reluctance to lead his camp which provokes mixed emotions towards him. Firstly, it's easy to appreciate his nobility and his loyalty towards his duties but this is juxtaposed with a feeling of disdain simply because he initially doesn't appreciate the lengths that the soldier's have went to in order to fin him, whilst abandoning their original duties in the army.Spelberg's direction is awe-inspired and flawless. He masterfully captures the brutality of combat in the 22-minute opening scene where there is blood, guts and gunfire in abundance. Does blood and guts make for a great depiction of war combat? Definitely not, but it's Spielberg's direction which involves extreme close-ups of casualties and of course, the blood and rain onto the camera lens is an effective technique. Spielberg is very impressive as he makes the viewer realise the pain and suffering, the desperation and sometimes futility of hard-fought combat. Contrary to these portrayals, he is equally effective in engaging the audience into positive emotions such as a feeling of triumph when the soldiers under the command of Captain Miller penetrate the German infantry on Omaha beach when it looked clear that the soldiers where in a desperate struggle against the Germans. The acting in this movie is not fantastic, it's not supposed to be. The movie, unlike so many others in the modern-day film industry, does not depend on the acting of the main protagonists in order for it to achieve on a number of levels. The acting, however, is impressive and believable. Believable being the operative word. Hanks and co. are very believable in terms of struggling to overcome adversity in its extremist form and battling the almost overwhelmingly brutal elements of combat. The film is particularly recognised for its intense opening scene set on the beach of Omaha, Normandy but in my opinion, the movie is entertaining, intense and captivating throughout the duration. It has no spells of boredom, there are no dull and listless sequences of dialogue. The dialogue sustains credibility, humour and purity.This film won 5 academy awards, it should have won more. It received accolades for direction, obviously and also won for cinematography and sound editing whilst the Best Picture went Shakespeare in Love (sigh).Overall, this is a masterpiece. An intense and brutal depiction of the elements of war. It does to an extent glorify American soldiers considering that a number of soldiers abandoned their respective duties in order to retrieve an unknown private but it does it in an engrossing manner. The script is solid, which is all it needs to be, the same goes with the acting but the cinematography, editing and effects are astonishing. Truly breathtaking. This is the best Spielberg film I have ever watched (I haven't seen Schindler's List) 10/10! Pure cinematic mastery!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving private ryan was incredible from the get go, the violence emotion and the acting was perfect. there was funny bits like when the big guy chucks his helmet at a nazi then shoots him with a pistol and when you watch this film you'll notice the same stuff was used in most war games. but why hasn't a Vietnam war film like platoon or apocalypse now not as good as this saving private ryan? .................................................................... The reason is that as i am Australian and i notice when propaganda films are made and saving private ryan made the Nazis look like vicious horrible humans that's not far from what they really where. BUT in a Vietnam war film that's made by Americans (platoon,Apoco now) they make it look like war is bad because the vicious disgusting Americans start stupid wars over nothing but in world war 2 the Americans where the good guys and that's easy to portrait. Now the Americans once again are fighting a war over nothing in iraq and Afghanistan but the Vietnamies didn't have access to nukes but the middle east might. So what im trying to say is Americans can make a person be proud of there country or cry for what has happened but they can't dismiss the past for what actually took place in Vietnam. (BTW Charlie Cheen acted badly in Platoon which didn't help and i saw tropic thunder before Platoon which buggered it up for me.)</fullReview>

Even with the language filtered (which was my only disappointment) this movie is on the verge of the NC-17. Nobody wanted to see what war was like. But Steven Speilburg made them anyway. When I saw this movie, my view of war changed. I had no idea of all the deaths and pain our soldiers went through to make the US a better country to live in. Body parts flying everywhere, a man that had his face blown off, blood spraying in all directions, men trying finding their missing limbs and men lying in their own intestines. And that's just the first 30 minutes in the Omaha beach scene. Like I said, this is a strong and moving film that is not for the weak stomach or for people that don't want to know what war was really like. I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved by the strong story and captivating effects that is "Saving Private Ryan."</fullReview>

The only bad part of the film is the lost of the war of the men that fought for the war. However, the script is wonderfully made, the effects and the sound is excellent. Steven Spielberg's direction is incredible on this project. One part of the film is when there's a family where the father gave away his daughter, that became suspenseful because the emotion on the kid's face is too emotional to watch. However the girl goes back to her father, however in that scene a solider gets killed from a sniper. The most bloodiest part of the film is the end which is a MUST SEE. Snipers, gun shots, bombs, a man the kills a solider with a knife. TOO BLOODY, however a must see movie. No kids are allowed to see this unless with accompanied adult, if you allow you kid to watch it, they will have nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ordinary men Great deeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is brilliant because it trys to get as close to realism as is possible and we need films like this every now and then to show us what went on in a different time . For me its the ending not the start that makes it although that start is unforgettable and brilliant but also devastatingly terrible .But the one thing that I marvel at is that men did that I cannot imagine where guys found the bravery to run up a beach and return fire in the face of that devastating machine gun fire .The one message that I think the whole movie conveys is one of ordinary men going to war and changing history the way they did for me the whole movie is summed up by Tom Hanks admission that he is a school teacher to put this in perspective think back to your old school teachers can you think of one of them who you would think capable of doing what his character did during this film or what the others did are any of us capable that is questions that this movie asks of us all while at the same time giving us the answers about a small part of war .Everybody should watch this movie as it is seminal and it does bring home some very stark realities if you don't like it then maybe you should continue to watch old John Wayne movies where the bullets bounced off of people and soldiers on the Allied side ran through enfilading fire without any of them getting hit.One day I hope Speilburg and Hanks collaborate on either a story on Okinawa , Iwojima American stories or Maybe Kohima a British and Indian story all 3 of these particular battles were all murderous in their own way and also It would bring to light a forgotten war because WWII did not just happen in europe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply love this movie! It's a masterpiece. Steven Spielberg has proved yet again that he is a genius. Tom Hanks performs an outstanding role in this movie. He's my favourite actor, among the few who won 2 consecutive Oscars. This movie enhances every sensation felt by those brave little soldiers. It's so realistic.I'm just amazed Hanks didn't win an Oscar 4 his performance, i mean he was just breathtaking. "With each man i kill, the farther from home i feel" - this quote leaves me speechless, it's so meaningful. I like this movie because it's atypical. The main character dies in the end, unlike in most war movies. I think this adds flavour to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece. I love war movies, but this one beats them all, hands-down. Not just for its graphic, realistic depiction of being in the middle of battle, but also for the incredible characters that are developed, and the quiet, intimate moments, where a soldier's sadness, loneliness, depression, and fear all start to kick in. If you've seen "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket", "The Thin Red Line", "Casualties of War", "Hamburger Hill", "We Were Soldiers", or any other war film, you need to see "Saving Private Ryan". It is the war movie by which all others will be judged for a very long time, maybe even forever. There are no words that can do it justice. This is the only movie I can give a "10" rating to, because in my mind, it literally is the perfect war movie in every sense. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess you must have to be an American to really get and love this movie because it's about American soldiers acting typically super-heroic and everything.The entire movie is based on a platoon of guys who get sent into the deep and dangerous territory behind enemy lines to save the Private Ryan of the title of the film.Apparently all his brothers have all been killed in the war so the government doesn't want their mother to lose her last son because it would be a huge public relations catastrophe so they send in a group of guys and risk a bunch of lives just to try to get this one specific soldier out.I liked some of the combat scenes but mostly I was just bored and thought they were too obviously and deliberately trying to pull at heart strings and wave the U.S. flag around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shutting up private Ryan (Cinematheque)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among all Spielberg's movies that I saw at the festival, this is the only one when I felt nothing leaving out except being disappointed and angry. Worst, I felt like this as soon as the first scene. Seeing this old man walking alone with his wife and family trotting behind was like a slap at my face. At this old age and having survived the war, it was extremely selfish for him to act like this. Having watched buddies killed and thus never experienced their family life, it was like he haven't learn anything of this trauma, for him or for them.Next, we are thrown at D-Day. It's the more interesting part of the movie: the value of any single soldier's life is dramatically visualized: those poor guys who got killed as soon as they opened the door of their boats are the true noble and courageous ones. They were sent to slaughter but they stick to their orders. For that matter, during WWI, a relative of my grand mother died the same way: In spite of being terribly myopic, he was among the first to be sent at the front and as it's above all rabbles, he lost his glasses and was killed immediately. Personally, I would never have behaved like them because I would have gone awol as much to not be killed as to not kill. At this moment, Spielberg's takes you in the guts and he may be the first director to show how bloody and stupid the war is. But as his trademark and sensibility lead him to find hope in this complete darkness, the story becomes a rescue mission. It could have been moving but the characters of this platoon is rather a band of capricious and lunatic soldiers: one wants to hang on with a child, the other left a German alive, the one that killed them later and finally, we met again with Mr. Ego who doesn't want to leave because he has a bridge to defend. Sure, as they stay there, they got all killed. Well, it was too much for me: I don't understand how Spielberg wanted the audience to relate with such stupidity . A life later, this private Ryan remains totally shameful as he rejects his family and I really wonder if he should have been left behind instead.Pairing: "1941" a good laugh at WWII but not for the same reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent but conventional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a fairly standard narrative in war films today: that wars are hell, but that the men who fight them deserve our respect, and it's perhaps unsurprising that Stephen Spielberg's film about the Normandy landings essentially repeats the message. The movie's structure: an initial battle, an interlude, and then a concluding fight, is also typical; and background music, slow motion scenes and a present day top-and-tail to the story are added in to make sure that the audience knows what to think. In spite of this, it's not a bad film, fully depicting the chaotic horror of war and resisting the temptation to easily close at least some of its subplots; although on other occasions, it's too clear how a given tale is going to end. A bigger problem for me, however, was the absence of a character I could really care about: Tom Hanks's hero is just too heroic for me to care about, not in a silly way but a character for us to admire rather than for us to feel empathy for. Although a lengthy movie, it didn't feel like one; but in the end, I didn't feel moved by its respectful conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Apocalypse Now? Yep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this may sound like blasphemy, but yes, Saving Private Ryan (SPR) is better than Apocalypse Now. How exactly? Well, for one thing, while sharing some themes, SPR is just so much more moving than Apocalypse Now. and, at least SPR doesn't go on, and on, and on, and on. Don't get me wrong, I liked Apocalypse Now, but SPR just didn't leave you with the feeling that there's no hope for the world, it left you with the feeling that there's hope for the world, that there's hope for humanity. And that it may be easy to descend into the heart of darkness, it's just as easy to ascend into the heart of light.And as I was saying from the beginning, about how SPR is more moving than AN, in the first 24 minutes I felt like crying. Watching all those people dying, imploding, exploding, being amputated, and etc. I realized, that had I been 18 in 1945, I could have been one of those people. And I further realized, that one person in that film represented 10 others, and that was just a softened version of the great D-Day Invasion.Saving Private Ryan also brilliantly showed how the suits in Washington thought of their soldiers. As Risk (copyright by Parker Brothers and Hasbro Co.) pieces. preferring to send 19 or so soldiers to their death to satisfy an unhappy mother, than send them home.Saving Private Ryan is by far my most favorite war movie. (1. Saving Private Ryan. 2. Glory. 3. Apocalypse Now.) It has won 5 Oscars, deserved every single one, and more, and is one of the best movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film overshadowed by Hollywoods failure to recognise others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and historically it was right on the ball for the landings and the subsequent movement of the other American troops.However, after doing a lot of research on D-Day, I was really disappointed in the way the filmmakers seemed to leave out important facts about the others who got involved in the war, primarily the British and the Canadians, who sent thousands of troops in to other beeches and didn't even get a mention. Another example of Hollywood feeding Americas "We single handedly saved the world" ego.However, like I said, a fantastic film, great actors and a great pulsating story filled with some amazing war shots and some great dialogue between characters, "Earn it!".Now i now this film was primarily about saving private Ryan and not so much about D-Day in depth, I think this is a fantastic opportunity for Hollywood to make an in-depth film about D-Day, by that I mean the intensive three year planning that had begun even before America joined the war, the RAF missions over Callais and other bluffs to make the Germans convicned the attack was coming there, even during the middle D-Day they were still convinced that another wave would hit elsewhere. And prehaps more about the thousands of paratroopers who took out the legendary Pegasus Bridge in the early hours of the morning to hold the entire post invasion operation together.However, random tangent aside, I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in history, it is incredibly accurate in all the other area apart from where I mentioned.I gave it 8 *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands alongside SCHINDLER'S LIST as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements as a director. And just recently, I had the pleasure of re-discovering his EMPIRE OF THE SUN, and realized then how well he captures on film the horror and brutality of war without going in for stereotyped characters.During the '40s, when war films were largely produced for propaganda purposes and for injecting much needed patriotism into all Americans while we fought Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese, we had films like A WALK IN THE SUN or GUADALCANAL DIARY or SO PROUDLY WE HAIL. All of them were fine, in their own way, but often resorted to creating Hollywood stereotypes among the characters, the soldiers and nurses who fought during the war.Not true here. From the startling twenty-minute opening sequence on the D-day invasion, through the intricacies of inter-personal relationships among a disparate group of men, we never once feel we're watching stereotypes but real people. All of the performances are first-rate, beginning with TOM HANKS, whose everyman personality is put to excellent use here. Others too numerous to mention do great jobs in the large supporting cast.No cheap heroics here, just a compelling war story, extremely well done and holding interest from beginning to end. Recommended highly.Trivia note: John Williams' score is never intrusive enough to damage the stark reality of some of the most brutal scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a question one of the greatest films ever made (in my humble opinion) *Possible Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a question one of the greatest films ever made (in my humble opinion). It's very sad gripping and often disturbing. Jaws was amazing but this is my favorite out of Steven Spielberg's films (i have not yet seen Schindler's list (but will soon). This film actually managed to make me shed a few tears at the end (it was very sad. this is EXTREMELY well made and brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg using great shots especially during the war scenes. This film will stay with you long after you have watched it, and it's very moving. Beware though if you have a weak stomach Don't watch this movie!. The scenes between Hanks and Damon were awesome and very touching. The plot was awesome but sending tons of soldiers just to find Private Ryan a lot of people had a problem with that but i loved it. this is now the 2nd war film i have seen and i will be seeing lots more VERY soon. this movie is EXTREMELY gory. we get a leg blown off, severed arm, HUNDREDS of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, one to the eye (cringe inducing) one to the neck that spurts TONS of blood, blood everywhere someone's guts falls out of someone's belly, as he tried to hold them in , very graphic surgery (you see guts intestines), more graphic surgery, blood keeps pouring from a gunshot wound (VERY bloody), badly wounded soldier, bloody corpses, TONS of people explode into pieces, arm's torso's and other severed limbs fly everywhere, hand bitten on, TONS of graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting, (one of the goriest films i have ever seen). The acting is no doubt Oscar worthy Tom Hanks gives a performance of a lifetime,and deserved an Oscar for his Incredible performance. he is incredible just incredible, he is EXTREMELY likable, and what he said to James Ryan near the ending, was very moving. He is one of the best actors out there Matt Damon gives a wonderful performance here as the young i liked him lots, in my opinion he is a very talented actor, him and Hanks had awesome chemistry together.Edawrd Burns is good here and did what he had to do well. Tom Sizemore was funny and did very well here i liked him lots.Jeremy Davies is very good he showed vulnerability and did great. Adam Goldberg does rock solid here as the tough guy of the bunch. Barry Peppers also did well. Giovani Ribsi did not have much to do. Vin Diesel was good in his limited screen time. Ted Danson has a cool cameo. Harrison Young does great as the older Ryan. Overall I can't recommend this movie enough you must see this as soon as possible if you haven't. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie got me interested in WWII.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw "Saving Private Ryan" I wasn't interested in anything WWII related. Every time there was a documentary on I would change the channel, I couldn't stand classics such as "The Guns of Navarone", "The Eagle Has Landed" and "The Longest Day", I even didn't liked "Schindler's List". And then I saw "Saving Private Ryan"..."Saving Private Ryan" is more than just an ordinary war movie. Its realism makes it important to watch for the entire world. It shows the horrors of war in a very direct way. It is mainly important to see for the young generation these days and those to come. Sure you can watch tons of documentaries and read dozens of books but watching this movie is the closest you can get to the real thing, it's that realistic.The first 30 minutes is a real wake up call. The Normandy invasion is really impressive and made very realistic with lots of noise and body parts flying around. The cinematography and the sound makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it. Yes, after that the movie becomes a bit slow but it never becomes uninteresting. The movie takes its time to build up the characters. As a result there follow some typical Spielberg sentiments but in this case I'll forgive him for that, I even forgive him for some of the American patriotism he puts in the movie.The D-Day landing isn't the only impressive thing about this movie. All of the battle sequences are filmed in an unique and very realistic way. The final battle is very tense, especially in the beginning when the tension gets build up right before the battle begins and you can hear the tanks approaching while the men nervously await. My heartbeat went at least 3 times faster than normal.I also like the portrayal of the German soldiers. In most other earlier movies they were portrayed as the ultimate bad guys that love to march and kill and follow every order they receive without thinking for them selves. In "Saving Private Ryan" they are more portrayed as just soldiers. Sure they do some bad things in the movie but so do the American soldiers, shooting surrendering Germans for instance. "Saving Private Ryan" show that there are no real good guys in war, which is very close to the truth I think.The characters are very realistic with real emotions. It also doesn't matter in the movie if you're a main character or the most interesting character of the movie, just like in real life everybody is vulnerable. The characters are wonderfully portrayed by an at the time and still relatively unknown cast, with the exception of Tom Hanks and Matt Damon of courseThe movie and its style set the standards for many later war movies to come but none of them comes really close to this masterpiece.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was a poorly made movie. There were few parts here and there which were truly touching and realistic, but otherwise I did not enjoy the movie. Spielberg said he made this movie as a tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives, he failed to deliver on that tribute. For the great sacrifice we made for the freedom, this was a half-hearted tribute. Tom Hanks fails to deliver as a captain, he is Tom Hanks all through the movie, not Capt. John Miller. Tom Siezemore and Edward Burns steal the show. Matt Damon had very small role, I don't understand why would he worship just John Miller and not others ? Does not make sense(except Dir wanted to add some emotion that was not build up). I mean the two hardly knew each other, just like the other soldiers.Also, it was insulting to see soldiers hang out like a bunch of high-school drop outs calling each other "morons" and so on. Did that sort of thing happen back in 1944 ? I don't know for sure but it surely does not fit into the scheme of things...May be I had too high an expectation from the movie, in any case I would give it ** out of *****. No Oscar for Spielberg. Supporting Actor Oscar for Tom Siezemore or Edward Burns or even the frightened kid would be good nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, but sentimental and historically flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary Saving Private Ryan a good movie, but it is a times painfully sentimental, American centred and, while suggesting realism, historically flawed.Sentimental because the movie is laden with strong emotional moments. The most marked of which is the one when the aged Ryan drops to his knees at the grave of a the captain who saved him exclaiming, "did i do good?".American centered because, while the us characters are lifelike all others are not. Most absurd are the Germans. For instance the climax of the movie sees the us cast being attacked by SS men. SS where no that old(average age of SS rank and file was between 17-21)but they where also not bald. Nor all that ugly. Nor that inept(front assaults with what is obvious a 20 mm gun is a laugh, tiger tanks where general deployed in groups, not in single instances, tanks where usually covered by infantry to prevent them from being ambushed by enemy infantry etc.) But most of all: there where no SS at that moment in time at that place. The SS units moving up to Normandy which could have intervened where delayed by an exceptional campaign of sabotage and interdictions. The airborne where in fact opposed by regular infantry and the unreliable ost-truppen most of the time. The only crack units that crossed swords with the airborne in early June where the fallschirmjaeger unit's near ST Lo. These did not posses tiger tanks. The story while breathing an air of being historically true is in fact mostly true to the American part, all the others are just to embellish the story. In this movie the US cast had to fight the SS equipped with tigertanks because in the US mind frame that was the best the Germans had to offer. (ironically: an inquiry among us soldier what they feared most put the tiger tank at the top of the list, it's ironical because of the 1350 odd produced tiger tanks 2/3 went to the east-front, 1/3 to the south and west front. What reached the Normandy front(running the gauntlet of interdictions and sabotage) where mostly deployed against the English sector and not the US sector(yes more than 50% of the forces landed where non us). The chance therefore that the us airborne would have been facing tigertanks in the early days of the invasion was equal to zero. And then the strange plot twists. The main characters land on Omaha beach, giving birth to one of the most intense movie scenes every filmed. It had to be Omaha because it was the hardest fought for. But then comes the weird part: the heroes are charged with saving Ryan who could have been better reached with less hassle by starting from Utah beach, which was closer to the drop zones and less opposed by the Germans. No the logical move would be to be shipped to the other beach but instead the story let's the saviors take a round-abound trip of 30 odd kilometres through enemy held territory without any explanation given. The movie wasn't aiming to be the historically accurate, it was a movie which made heroes of soldiers who did their job, despite misgivings and in the face of adversity. I somehow feel that the way the movie display heroism is wrong, that it is detracted in the way this movies tells the story. The stories main emotion is exemplified by the sentimental looking guy who looks at the stars thinking of home, murmuring something about the cakes his mother made for him when he was ten. Investigations into the mindset of the average soldier paints another picture. Home was another planet, there was no time to look at the stars, if you had that time, you went to sleep, for there was always a lack of sleep. If you didn't sleep you ate or drank. Instead of creating a band, veteran soldiers shut themselves of from others because most of those others would be dead within a months time. There might have been a band, but it wasn't one of brothers. It was a band of survivors. Like Letters of Iwo Jima it isn't an overtly political statement, but it is historically flawed and overtly sentimental to the point of being untrue. Nevertheless it is still a good movie that should be looked at as being fiction and the sentimental part can be skipped and the historical vaults forgiven.</fullReview>

I happened to see The Thin Red Line first in the theatre which was a tremendeous experience to me. After that I saw Saving Private Ryan and I thought it was a huge step down from the Terrence Mallick masterpiece about Guadalcanal which I'm afraid was released the worst time possible. I definitely believe that the succes of SPR has something to do with the Oscar winning director Steven Spielberg who's a certain winner every time. But I look at SPR as a way too classical movie with the classic white vs black scenario. Not much more than an easily digestive action film which has great effects and great action but nothing that gets to me like The Thin Red Line did it. Sorry, Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best war film ever made, but perhaps the most realistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Steven Spielberg has done with "Saving Private Ryan" is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of World War II, and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing -- a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death. The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.The movie, based on the actual events surrounding the Nilan brothers during World War II, is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a young man who loses three brothers in the war, and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find, and return, Private Ryan to safety.The men who fight alongside Miller have to question their own actions. What makes Private Ryan more important than any of them? They all have mothers, too. But they follow orders, venturing into the battlefields of WWII France in search of Private Ryan. The most reluctant of the soldiers is Private Reiben (Edward Burns), a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another man.The battle scenes are ultimately what made "Saving Private Ryan" one of the highest-grossing films of the decade, and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters. Many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences, the landing at Omaha Beach, which probably lasts about fifteen minutes -- at least.However, the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture. This is a fascinating account of war, packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film, but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations. "Earn this," Captain Miller tells Private Ryan at one point in the film.Spielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of film-making to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life. Spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project, as much as he felt it was necessary to direct "Schindler's List." Both films work as a sort of documentary-style motion picture, but also contain fundamental emotional truths, which elevate them to higher ground.Tom Hanks, as Captain Miller, is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture, but Hanks' position in the film works (to great effect) primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier. As we too often forget, the men who fight wars are not always the Schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition. The soldiers in World War II were fathers, husbands, brothers, sons. Hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay alive.Is "Saving Private Ryan" a better movie than "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," or other great war pictures in the genre? Not necessarily. But it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure film-making, and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against Hitler's armies. If you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare, "Saving Private Ryan" is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan is a true horror movie. I watched it because I wanted to see a good action movie but the opening sequence really scared the hell out of me and the movie left me pondering over it for hours afterwords.It's great that there is a movie that shows war's effects on the human body and mind rather than a toned down political chess game. This movie has some amazing cinematography with lots of gray colors to add to the gloom.Spielburg always manages to create movies that stir up emotions like no other director can. Spielburg and George Lucas are the dynamic duo of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is the best war movie ever made. Yes, it should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. The Academy sank to the level of the Nobel Prize with this slight. Yes, it is about WW2, in which the Allies were the good guys and the Germans were the bad guys. Unfortunately, by the Hated It reviews, it appears that there continue to be people of German heritage who expected Spielberg to be evenhanded in his treatment of WW2. Silly Germans and unreconstructed Nazi sympathizers - your guys started a war, committed genocide, and had to be destroyed. That's reality.There also appear to be a good number of non-US reviewers who hate this movie simply because it was made in the US, from the US point of view. I can certainly understand the envy that mouth-breathing countries have of the US. The opening sequence might be the most intense 20 minutes in movie history. Sorry Germans but it was necessary to kill your people in the invasion. Yup, we even killed some German soldiers who wanted to surrender. Oops! The Americans sent to rescue Private Ryan weren't all saints, which is reality, but NONE of the Germans killed in this movie were saints. The worst American was far more moral than the best Nazi. The story is about Americans soldiers who did their jobs, many killed in the process. BTW, the Americans could have but did not commit genocide against the conquered Germans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent depiction, but not a perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not see a whole lot of war movies, but "Saving Private Ryan" is definitely an exception. This film simply has a fascinating plot and great dialogue between the soldiers. The film tells the story of a group of soldiers who must find private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and send him home to his mother, as she realizes that her three other sons were killed in battle. The rest of the film deals with issues such as deciding whether saving a man's life is worth losing several lives of your own soldiers and to what extent one must be loyal to their given orders. Tom Hanks could have (and probably should have) won an Oscar for his role, as he pulls off each scene amazingly well, as usual. The interactions between him and the soldiers, especially Private Ryan, are perfectly done, proof of Spielberg's excellent directing. What prevents the film from being entirely perfect is the overall lack of scenes with dialogue. So much of the film (at least 60%) is made up of battle scenes. Although the depictions of war are very realistic and well done, they tend to drag on too long. It's the dialogue scenes and the decisions the characters must make that make the film as great as it is, but more of those scenes are needed to keep the audience engaged. Nevertheless, an excellent depiction of war, great direction, and great acting make this a very monumental and interesting film. Definitely worthwhile and important to see.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's 1998 exercise in Oscar-mongering is a compilation of effects and impressions from all the war movies he's ever seen, decked out with precise instructions about what to think in Robert Rodat's script and how to feel in John Williams's hokey music. There's something here for everybody--war is hell (Sam Fuller), war is father figures (Oliver Stone), war is absurd (David Lean, Stanley Kubrick), war is necessary (John Ford), war is surreal (Francis Coppola), war is exciting (Robert Aldrich), war is upsetting (all of the preceding and Lewis Milestone), war is uplifting (ditto)--and nothing that suggests an independent vision, unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual (the visceral opening sequence, showing Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944) or someone getting graphically shot underwater. The story is about a squad trying to find and send home a private whose three older brothers have already been killed in World War II; it's a mission ordered by General George C. Marshall (backed by the authority of Abraham Lincoln, who's backed in turn by Spielberg) and executed by Tom Hanks, a captain named John instead of Joe. It has a few pretty good action moments (including a climax straight out of the Indiana Jones trilogy), a lot of spilled guts, a few moments of drama that don't seem phony or hollow, some fairly strained period ambiance, and a bit of sentimental morphing that reminds me of Forrest Gump; it also lasts the better part of three hours. With Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Barry Pepper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the example of JAWS and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, Steven Spielberg's cinematic masterpiece falls victim to the idiocy of the Academy Awards. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is arguably the best picture of the year and one of the best of all time. The performances are perfect throughout, and the characters are very well-written. This is doubtlessly the most historically accurate movie I've ever seen. Even the dialogue is perfectly written, with surprisingly close attention paid to the accuracy of even the mildest, most casual and briefly-dealt-with topics of conversation. The battle scenes are excellent, and the carnage is both realistic and necessary to add to the film's power. And the underscoring, subtle and sparingly used, is truly beautiful.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN will go down in history. It makes us both understand and appreciate the sacrifices made by our soldiers over 50 years ago. Thought-provoking, shocking, effectively dramatic, beautifully made, and highly intriguing, this movie is a brilliant example of cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all historic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was overall a great movie. --BUT-- (big scary letters) But only the first 20 minutes were actually historic. I know maybe it wasn't meant to all be historic but doesn't a war movie usually have to be like the real thing? The actual Omaha beach scene at the start is the only real historic event, the rest is all fictional. Thoug I cannot reveal why it is not all fictional I can still tell you that whatever the movie describes and/or you think it is, war is not always actually like what you see.War is gruesome, painful, depressing (x 9222845363), terrible, and basically it is one of the most horrible things that can ever happen. Dying is not horrible, as everyone is meant to die, but the pain and agony and all the other things that go along with war is.So basically I'd like to stick to more historically accurate movies.Also, America FORGOT (OR MAYBE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO INCLUDE) THE COUNTRIES THAT DID MOST OF THE DIRTY WORK!!!!! LIKE CANADA!!!!!!! LIKE GREAT Britain!!!!!!!! HOW CAN YOU FORGET THEM TOO???????????????????????????????????????? Also, the movie was incredibly corny. It was not true AT ALL except for the first 20 minutes. It's like they say about North American cars and European cars: THEY ADD MORE GADGETS AND TAKE AWAY ALL THE QUALITY!Yet we must remember the ones whom actually fought. Lest we forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Tom Hanks as Captain John H. Miller Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Michael Horvath Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade Jeremy Davies as Corporal Timothy E. Upham Matt Damon as Private James Francis RyanPlot: A squadron of troops is told to search for Private James Ryan, the last of four brothers who have all been killed in Normandy. They face numerous odds on the battlefield to find Ryan and get him home.I knew this movie was critically hailed when I first watched it, but surprisingly I had no real interest in war movies at the time. Sure, it may sound odd but war is depressing, and to watch a movie based on real people getting killed doesn't equal a good time for me. But Spielberg is an excellent filmmaker and the cast is superb, so I finally say down and gave this one a try.Wow. What a drama this was. It goes to show everyone that war is hell. And if you don't believe that statement, watch the first half-hour, which has been commended for it's graphic, gory realism. You leave that first scene feeling pretty worn out, and then you realize that was just the beginning. That's what Spielberg was going for. He wanted you to know that war is rough for the soldiers. He went for a gritty feel that didn't glorify war like some movies, but presented it in it's destructive glory. He even lowered the colors so as to make it feel gray and bleak. That is a great director for you.Direction is fine, but if the cast isn't ready to make you care about who gets blown up, then you probably won't. A great cast was selected here. It was mostly Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and everyone else, because they either were new, or had normally played bit parts. Vin Diesel was unknown at the time. But everyone, including Diesel(I know, I'm surprised too) brings it here. They deliver as an ensemble. You feel that they're a bunch of guys thrown together in this platoon, and they really don't like the mission they are on. It's a great job to everyone involved. You get the younger guys showing what they can do, the veterans(Burns, Sizemore) holding everything down and the main stars doing what they do best.The special effects and score, once again need to get praised. That opening scene would not have been as effective without the gore effects. It's one thing to have guys fall over and acknowledge their dead. It's another to show it in bloody detail. This movie uses gore to it's advantage, and not just as a throw-away device. While other movies are surely guilty of this, this movie is not. Nothing much else needs to be said about John Williams' work on Spielberg films but the score is kind of low-key and haunting here, unlike other previous ones.Saving Private Ryan introduced me into the world of war-related film. It was enough to make me have tremendous respect for the genre. It's one of my favorite films and I can't recommend it enough. That's why it gets the rating I gave it. Go see this if you haven't, and be prepared to blown away, although not in the literal sense.Rating: ***** of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to other WWII movies I've seen, this one stands out. The opening battle of Omaha Beach was intense. It made me feel like I'd been there. The closing battle was also frighteningly realistic. The scene where the platoon's respite is interrupted by the rumbling of tanks was white-knuckle scary. It wasn't entirely free from clichés. The scene where Ryan's mother is told about the news of her sons' deaths was sad, but....a farm in the heartland? It would have been more powerful if she lived on a city block in New York or San Francisco. I didn't like the scene where Matt Damon's character is clutching his ankles and rocking while crying in the midst of battle. I don't think many GI's would do that. It was also far-fetched and inexplicable why the Nazi soldier would descend a staircase and pass a cowering GI with nine yards of machine gun bullets draped over his shoulder without killing him in he midst of a desperate battle. Still, the movie was a triumph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of avoiding, I finally got around to viewing SPR. Considering the hype--I was expecting greatness--I got---a 3 Hr rehashing of Schindler's List masquerading as an action-flick.Though not the worst film, or the worst WWII movie, it certainly is among the most overrated. The D-Day landing sequence is horrific, riveting and emotionally numbing, a true landmark in film-making. Realistic?--wouldn't know--wasn't there--my uncle was, and from certain things he spoke of--seems fairly accurate. Then there's the rest of the movie....There are plenty of reviews pointing out historical, tactical, writing, acting and directing flaws. That's all minor stuff, hardly worth mentioning--I can overlook a lot of warts when I'm in love. I couldn't even build up a mild affection for this film. After numerous sacrifices by much worthier individuals, the only people who survive are the most undeserving, self-absorbed, venal and craven of the characters in the film. Then, after living an apparently good life(surrounded as he is by loving family members), not even the title character can justify those sacrifices on his behalf. As for the typist--is everyone insane or just daft? He shoots the German to cover up his cowardice, NOT because he finds his inner Rambo.Deep? Maybe for a mud puddle. According to SPR the Great Generation was so because of the sacrifices of their betters and their own need to live up to the implied expectations of those sacrifices. How droll. If you want a Great war movie, there are many--A Bridge too Far, Gallipoli, The Big Red One, Tora Tora Tora, All Quiet on the Western Front, Das Boot, Bridge Over The River Kwai---These are all WAY better movies, and None of them could be classified as droll---go watch one or all, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There were two mistakes in the film, "Saving Private Ryan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with an elderly man and his family visiting the allied cemetery in Normandy, France. He approaches the grave of Captain Miller and becomes very emotional. We do not know who this elderly man is. He then looks out toward the sea and then begins the flashback of the D-Day invasion. The next 29 minutes or so is a superb, factual, brutal and graphic account of the American landing on beach, code named "Omaha". The loss of life on "Bloody Omaha" was enormous and unimaginable. After the break through, we see a soldier collecting some soil in a metal container. Here is where the first mistake occurs. We see that this soldier has other containers with soil samples as well. On one of the containers the word, "Italy" is written. Well, my friends, there is no way that this soldier could have been in Italy and then called upon to take part in the Normandy invasion.At the end of the movie, we learn that the elderly man is none other than Private Ryan. Here comes the other big mistake. In the story Private Ryan was parachuted behind enemy lines. He was NOT part of the seaborne D-Day invasion. How could he possibly envision the invasion when he was not there at all. Any flashback involves the person being physically present in any given situation.Well, there you have it my friends. As much as I love Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, an awful blunder was made right from the beginning. Private Ryan was not there and therefore he couldn't possibly have visualized what happened there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the most emotive - and best - war movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally speak in superlatives, but I honestly have never been more affected by a film than I was with Saving Private Ryan. I was near tears 5 minutes into the movie.As the ramps on the landers dropped and wave after wave of Allied troops were immediately cut down by German machine-gunners, I sat in horrified silence. A single tear rolled down my cheek. That tear was followed by a dozen others. And as the terror continued in front of my unblinking eyes, those dozen were joined by two dozen more. I now understood - or at least had a better understanding of - why I never want to be involved in a war.Spielberg's re-enactment of D-Day at Omaha Beach stands as one of the single-most brilliant pieces of film ever shot. It also shows cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn to be two of the most inventive minds in their respective fields. Kaminski's shaky, newsreel-style hand-held photography and point-of-view shots and his willingness to use varying quality film stocks, over and under-expose shots and play with film speeds provide the opening battle with a total lack of visual continuity which fits in perfectly with the confusion Spielberg wanted to create. And Kahn's editing progressed the film through that confusion, making a story out of a mess of body parts and beautifully showing the push from the water to the ridge. His brilliant work on Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) temporary deafness moments alone must have taken days, if not weeks.For proof of the Normandy scene's authenticity, ask the veterans. Many sent Spielberg kudos (check the Trivia link for this movie), and many are known to have suffered horrible flashbacks after seeing this film. That's proof enough for me.Oh yeah...the rest of the movie was pretty damn good as well. I still wonder how this film ever lost the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare In Love, which will be forgotten in 2 years (if it hasn't been forgotten already).One final note: All those who complained about the mistaken identity of the old man in the opening scene, you were not being tricked into thinking he was Captain Miller (Tom Hanks). If you were being tricked, Spielberg would've had a shot of Captain Miller's eyes immediately following the extreme close-up of the old man's eyes. Instead, we see the beach, then a couple of shots of the landing craft making their way toward said beach. Wake up, people...this was not meant to fool you. You fooled yourselves.9.5 out of 10, the half mark lost for the lack of representation of other Allied nations (U.K. and Canada, especially) on D-Day, and for Ted Danson.</fullReview>

Incidentally, I can't agree with those criticising the portrayal of the Germans.

		<fullReview>Anyone else have dreams about Omaha Beach after watching this movie? While I say the movie is too real, I do have one comment on the authenticity. If Tom Hank's character was in the first wave onto Omaha, he, and the rest of the cast probably would've been killed, too. Gosh, how's that for an entertaining thought? I remember feeling like I got hit by an 88 after the first 20 minutes. And then you get to see lingering individual death scenes after almost every sequence (the slow knife death in the house fight was senseless). I am a history major, but I don't like accurate history movies (a lot of history is depressing). I'll read about it. So, I guess I am not the target audience for this movie; I do like some war movies (Big Red One, Blackhawk Down, Platoon). I'll give Steven Spielberg credit for honoring the memory of World War II vets in demonstrating the horror and frustration they went through, but I can only watch that once. When you watch someone die in The Longest Day, you think "oh no, there goes Sal Mineo"; with Ryan, you know that was a real person who just flopped out of his landing craft and drowned. I'm sure that is what war is really like, I just don't want to eat popcorn in front of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg deservedly won the Oscar for directing Schindler's List, and he did it again with another World War II film, this time in the battle itself, he was also won the Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA. Basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on Ohama beach with Captain John H. Miller (Oscar BAFTA nominated, and medal for Distinguished Public Service Award (highest US Navy Civilian honour) winning Tom Hanks) and his troops struggling for survival against the Nazi Germans. After surviving this, they are given a special mission that they don't understand the significance of, to find one man and bring him home. They are now on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and when they eventually find him, he doesn't know why he is needed to get home. This film may have its annoying chats and breakaways from battle, probably why it's four out of five stars, but this still sticks closer to the truth than fiction. Also starring Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Pvt. Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Pvt. Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Pvt. Stanley Mellish, Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade, Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Timothy P. Upham, Ted Danson as Captain Fred Hamill and Paul Giamatti as Sergeant Hill. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Makeup, Best Music for John Williams, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest War Films.
