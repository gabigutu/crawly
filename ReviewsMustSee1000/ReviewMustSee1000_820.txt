		<shortDescription>An excellent adaptation of a great novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a future where books have been outlawed, firemen are paid to burn books instead of put fires out. However, one fireman realizes that what he is doing is wrong and decides to go against the degenerate society he lives in.I have read reviews of this movie calling it "boring" and "outdated," and frankly I am amazed by how ignorant some people can be. Calling "Fahrenheit 451" outdated simply because the set designs look old and because there are no flashy computer effects shows that you have completely missed the point. The people who made this were not trying to give you a spectacle, they were trying to give you a message - a message that is even more important today than it was when this movie came out."Fahrenheit 451" is a fine adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic novel about censorship. The movie changes many of the book's events, but the spirit of the book is preserved. The cinematography is truly great and the score is quite powerful. The acting is also great. Oskar Werner is right on the money as Montag the fireman. Julie Christie is wonderful playing dual roles as yin and yang: Montag's zombie-like wife, Linda, and Montag's friend, the young and energetic Clarisse. Cyril Cusack is also memorable as the evil Fire Captain Beatty - he isn't a cartoon villain, but a very realistic and human character.You may think that "Fahrenheit 451" delivers an irrelevant message. You may think that book burning is a thing of the past, a relic of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Look around you - book burning happens every day! How do you feel about people trying to ban "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" because the word "nigger" is used in it? How about whole sections of "Doctor Dolittle" being rewritten so that they are politically correct? Did you know that school textbooks may not make any mention of Mount Rushmore because it is offensive to a certain Indian tribe? Meanwhile, we are watching our giant-screen TVs and listening to our Walkmans (two inventions that were predicted by Bradbury). We are constantly "plugged in" and never take any time to just sit and think. Look around you - Ray Bradbury's story is coming true. I advise you to watch this movie, and to read the book. (Read the book first. You will appreciate the film more.)I hear that a remake is in the works. No doubt it will be filled with gaudy special effects and silly Hollywood cliches. I guess I should hold off judgment until I actually see it, but I doubt that it will contain any of the genius that can be found in this sadly underrated gem. It will be interesting to see what they do with the mechanical hound, though....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go figure that I had the privilege of seeing "Fahrenheit 451," for free, on a big screen a few years back (an independent Illinois art house had gotten hold of what was allegedly one of the last surviving prints), and at the time hadn't the foggiest concept of how PRIVILEGED an event it was. Sitting in a theater crowded with college students on a budget with nothing better to do, I watched this diverting little retro item, appreciated its subtlety, nuance, bold visual style, and 'got' the message that if we're not careful, we'll be mindless drones having our desires dictated by The Tube (in current times, that's hardly a profound statement).Francois Truffaut's adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel is a bold visual feast that presents a time that might seem 'retrograde' in the eye of a modern pop-culture snob, but ultimately projects what a conceivable 'future' might look like (and not that CGI malarkey served up in "The Matrix"). Interiors of houses are awash in odd colors and give shelter to appliances that don't look dissimilar from our own; TV screens embedded in living-room walls play programs which vacuous housewives interact with sometimes. The film is so relentlessly confident in its appearance that it withstands the test of time.Though if "Fahrenheit 451" only had its storybook style to rely on, it would fade and be filed away as a mere technical achievement. Truffaut, working from strong source material, concocts a riveting parable about ignorance and the things we, as humans, take for granted. The story follows Guy Montag, an Everyman who is employed as a fireman--a connotation which entails ransacking residences in search of books (reading and writing have been outlawed in this world) and burning them. He has a medicated-smile wife (Julie Christie), a quiet home life, and is in line for a promotion, until a neighbor (Christie again) inspires him to question his motives for working such a sordid job.One character argues that books cause depression, making people confront unpleasant feelings. "Fahrenheit 451" sometimes runs the risk of lending truth to that statement--in some ways, it is a bleak commentary on civilization, but at the same time grounded in a benevolent humanity that offsets Orwell's brutal, pessimistic world of "1984" (though both texts and films share similar themes). This humanity is underlined in an upbeat, even comic ending (the details of which I won't divulge here)."Fahrenheit 451" is a spellbinding work of art, in good company with other incendiary works ("A Clockwork Orange" and "Fight Club" come to mind) that have defied the constraints of time and age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing, underrated sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Ray Bradbury's novel about totalitarian society that has banned books and printed words in order to eliminate independent thought; Oskar Werner plays professional book-burner who becomes enraptured with stories. Possibly a bit too thin at this length, but a fascinating peek at a cold future (which the times have just about caught up to). Didn't get a warm reception from critics in its day, yet the performances by Werner and Julie Christie (in a dual role as both Werner's wife and a rebel acquaintance) are top notch. I was never a fan of director François Truffaut's too-precious stories of childhood, but this film, curiously his only English-language picture, is extremely well-directed; the sequence with the woman and her books afire is one amazing set-piece, with tight editing, incredible and precise art direction, and the camera in all the right places. Truffaut lets you feel the agony of book paper curling up black in a mass of orange flames, and the proud defiance of the woman as she herself strikes the match. Unforgettable. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine a world without books....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 451" is a strange film, hard to describe. No one could have interpreted the classic Bradbury novel in the same bizarre, fascinating manner as Francois Truffaut. It's a book, and a film, about freedom, choices, individuality, and intellectual repression in a future where books are forbidden; where Firemen are men who start fires...fires in which they burn books.It was also the first color film directed by Truffaut. Although he by all accounts was not happy about making a color film and found it a bit unsettling, color is used to great effect here; sparingly, except for the extreme shade of red that is seen throughout."Fahrenheit 451" is supposed to be the temperature at which book paper catches fire, as the protagonist Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) explains in a scene at the beginning. Guy is a Fireman who seems happy enough with his life until he is approached by a young woman named Clarisse (Julie Christie) on his way home from work one day. She starts up a conversation with him, and the two become friendly. She bewilders him but challenges him to think and feel....and read. And when he arrives home we see his wife (also played by Julie Christie, with long hair), sedated and watching the wallscreen (TV of sorts)...we see what his life is really like, although he had told Clarisse he was "happy"...he is not.As his friendship with Clarisse grows, he starts to secretly take home, hoard, and read some of the books he finds in the course of his daily work, and as he reads, he becomes obsessed with the books. They become his mistress, and are what finally make him feel affection and warmth. And when he starts to feel and care, so do we.The two single best scenes are a passionate one involving an old woman who refuses to leave her books, her "children" as she calls them; and the wonderful ending of the film. The countless, painful closeups of books as they are being burned are beautifully done, and difficult to watch.Truffaut was a well-known disciple of Alfred Hitchcock's films, so when Hitchcock fired his long-time music collaborator Bernard Herrmann during the filming of "Torn Curtain", Truffaut was thrilled to acquire his talents for his own film. The score for "F451" is beautiful, and the film would not be nearly as effective without it.Writer/producer/director Frank Darabont ("The Green Mile", "The Shawshank Redemption") is working on a new film of "Fahrenheit 451" this year. He says it won't be a remake of the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the movie is slow. Yes, the sets and the costumes are very 60ish and very dated. But it has something to say.Its depiction of a narcissistic, alienated, superficial, mass media lobotomized culture might ring true for more than a few of us. The movie also shows the fireman's wife as being addicted to downers/uppers. All of the "normal" human relations that are shown in the movie appear to be detached and lacking emotion.People are not to trouble themselves with unpleasant thoughts or feelings. Hence, the banning of books and literature. They bring up unpleasant, sad, and depressing subjects. They depict too much of life as it actually is. This is troubling to people. Consequently, the government pushes drugs, emotion-free and sanitized sex, and witless mass media. There is more than a little resemblance to our society of the year 2000 and heaven knows what the future will bring.Oskar Werner is one my favorites, so I'm very prejudiced, but I think he does an excellent job. I think both Truffaut and Werner wanted the audience to see the fireman's partial dehumanization. He recovers much of that humanity as the film progresses. The supporting cast was good, especially the actor who played the fire chief. Julie Christie was good in the film, too, although her self-conscious woodenness or manner bothered me more than Werner's.Perhaps something less than one of the great films. But it is a very thoughtful film with a lot to say to its audience--although some viewers choose to focus only on its rather dated veneer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cautionary tale for our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of "Fahrenheit 451" since its initial relase ca. 1966 was last night, via DVD. I highly recommend this DVD version--it includes excellent bonus material, including a moving account of composer Bernard Herrman's role in making the film. I rated the film a "9" despite not being a big Truffaut fan; there's something about the "feel" of his movies that makes me fidgety and leaves me dissatisfied. But that same feel seems just right in this atypical piece of his--he felt he had failed to make the movie right, and he had difficulties with it that are explained in the bonus material. I think what resulted was an unsuspected and unintended success, instead.Now more than ever in recent history, we face problems with individual liberties that are uncannily reflected in this film. Watch it as a cautionary tale, as a visually stunning experience, and as an example of some of the best film music ever composed: but watch it. I think you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 451 -- On the Web, the Paper Does Not Have to Burn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film first appeared in theaters in 1966. The Vietnam War was just getting under way. The Pentagon was beefing up its disinformation campaign that was later documented in David Halberstam's book The Best and the Brightest. The film is based on a novel by Ray Bradbury, first published in 1953, when the hysterical Red Scares of McCarthyism were near their peak.Bradbury's writing was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview, Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction.That the "New Wave" director, Francois Truffaut agreed to direct the film was unusual. Bradbury was already an established writer, who probably wanted some artistic control, but Truffaut was promoting the auteur theory of film in which the director has absolute artistic control.The friction had a couple of effects on the film. Truffaut, eager to begin filming wrote the screenplay before fully mastering English. Even Truffaut was disappointed in the end with the stiff, flat dialog. For Truffaut, Fahrenheit 451 was his first, and last, English-language film. This may have contributed to the flatness of the characters.Some reviewers made an asset out of the stiffness by saying that the characters, deprived of serious thinking, and of books, and addled by drugs, were themselves, in fact, flat, soulless creatures.The central character, Guy Montag, (Oskar Werner) is a "fireman." In this disturbing vision of the future, firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have "conflicting ideas" in them. Those ideas can make people unhappy. It is the government's job to keep people happy, with drugs, large-screen television, and other entertainment.Let's keep it positive.The novel played on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought, mainly through intimidation, was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists, who supported Senator Joe McCarthy. The book burnings by Nazis, which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II, were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.By the time the film appeared, America was more concerned with race riots. So, burning was a viscerally powerful theme. Lost on most viewers in 1966 was the detail that among the burned books was the film journal Cahiers du Cinema for which Truffaut wrote, and that on the magazine's cover was a picture from the film Breathless, written by Truffaut. Also among the burned books: The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451, both written by Bradbury.SPOILER ALERT Truffaut, however, contributed much to the uniqueness of the film as a work of art separate from the book. From the opening credits, which were spoken and not displayed on the screen, to the ending, in which the exiles who have devoted their lives to memorizing books recite their books while walking blissfully in the snow, Truffaut's genius is there.Also a stroke of genius was the casting of Julie Christie as Monag's drug-addled wife, and as the more compassionate and interested Clarisse, who seduces him into reading and thinking.Like Brave New World, a book by Aldous Huxley, Fahrenheit 451 describes a hedonist world, where the people need not think.If you like Fahrenheit 451, you might also like the 1956 animated film version of George Orwell's Animal Farm, now available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reading is fundamental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading several whinny comments about how the movie is so different from the book I just had to add my two cents. Hello people! These are two different mediums here, like comparing Katherine Hepburn to Audrey Hepburn. They are two different entities which stand alone on their own merits.I read the book years and years ago, and frankly, I don't remember much about it. I'd seen the movie in years past, and it never knocked my socks off. But upon viewing it last night, I have to say I found myself thoroughly engrossed in it. The scene in the monorail where all the passengers are trying to stimulate themselves through their sense of touch is quite moving. As is the neighbor who declares, "They aren't like us, are they?"It's never going to be a movie in which you want to see over and over again (like the fluffy Wizard of Oz, again a book that is totally different from the movie, where are the complaining people now?) but it's a movie that should be seen. I also wonder how many people will complain when the new version comes out? I can hear them now, "The first movie was so much better!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yes, there is something wrong between Montag and the poll...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montag, with the help of the beautiful neighbor, had just started reading novels and the poll at the fire department he worked for refused to take him up. Because the poll accepts only those who obey with the law: Burn any book you find. Books are enemies, books are bad, books may cause suffering, distraction, chaos, disorder, rebel...Books make people anti-social. They'd better watch TV (numbing and dumbing interactive shows mostly). So, some time in the future, the government bans any kind of reading, and firemen are from that moment in charge of putting fire on the books, not putting fire out. So what are the consequences? People lose identity: they are similar to each other with nothing to distinguish oneself from the other, they live in their unreal and artificially happy(!) little worlds, alienated and detached from one another, they lack love and passion, they lack emotion...they rub their cheeks against the fur of their coats continuously, feeding their need for love probably...they have very short memories, they take sedatives daily to keep their emotions under control... This is the reason for all this. They think humanly emotions are the main sources for humanly suffering and unhappiness. So, to avoid this, they ban books which have proved to wake emotions, to convey the most intriguing, challenging feelings to people. TV is harmless, of course without much complexities. After all, TV can change people, too, so they keep it simple, allowing for people to become as robotic and as cold and as dumb as possible. So that their memory together with their intelligence (especially emotional intelligence) is disabled. Memories make people unhappy, too. The wife does not even remember when she first met Montag...And on the other hand, there are the ''book-people''. Each is a book him/herself, having memorized his/her whole book verse by verse, trying to survive illegally in the woods. They are so few, and so sad...Truffaut's cinematography is immensely good. Especially in the first half of the movie there are great shots. Reverse movements, cleverly used close-ups, jumps, great editing...The decoration is kept as simple and cold as possible, with straight lines dominating, pale colors and all are well in line with the theme. And of course the credits with words and no writing -that was perfect! Also, as the credits were being told, the focuses on the TV antennas on the roofs of the houses were very cleverly done.A 10/10 for me. I watched each moment of the film, amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Premise But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A society where books are banned ! It's not a fantasy . Consider the likes of Nazi Germany , Stalin's Russia , Mao's China etc , but the flaw with FAHRENHEIT 451 lies in the idea that not certain books are banned but ALL books are banned . Think about that for a moment then ask yourself this question : How would a society be able to function under this law ? We're shown schools still exist but how do pupils learn without being able to read text , and if people can not read text then how will they be able to write ? It seems impossible that a society would still be able to function without books That flaw is down entirely to Ray Bradbury's source material but Francois Truffaut's adaptation of Bradbury's novel is very uneven in every way . Take the cast for example , Oskar Werner seems very miscast while Anton Differing is once again very type cast as a fascist ( Differing's last ever role was in an episode of DOCTOR WHO where he played a Nazi war criminal ! ) , but Cyril Cusack gives a very good performance as the fire chief . Traffaut also shows his new wave roots by casting Julie Christie - Quite unnecessarily - in two different roles . And talking of new wave this is the movie that's best remembered as having the title sequence whose credits come via a voice over as the camera zooms in on a montage of TV receivers , and watch out for the scene where it looks like we're going to be treated to a split scan sequence then for some reason we're not . To give the director credit though his visage of the near future is very recognisable unlike many directors at the time who seemed to think we'd be living in space cities by the end of the 20th century **** MILD SPOILER ****Perhaps FAHRENHEIT 451 can be summed up by its ending . It's touching and sad and feels very European ( And watch out for the injoke ) but once again there's flaws with the idea of the book people . Just how much information can the average human being assimilate ? Even more importantly - How would a human being be able to keep that information in their head for the rest of their lives ? I doubt if I'd be able to remember this review word for word this time next week Despite the many flaws I did enjoy this film for the most part and I'm someone upset that Hollywood feels the need to do another version of Bradbury's novel even though the remake is being made by the director of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION . No doubt we'll be treated to scenes of Stephen King books being torched</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Books Are Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a future totalitarian and oppressive society, where books are forbidden, Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman. The mission of firemen in this society with fireproof houses is to burn books at 451o F, the temperature of combustion of paper. Montag is married with Linda (Julie Christie), a futile woman that joins "The Family" through the interactive television. When Montag meets Clarisse (Julie Christie, in a double role), she questions him if he has never read a book, and Montag become curious. He decides to steal and read a book, twisting his view of life.François Truffault is one of my favorite directors, and his unique English-spoken film "Fahrenheit 451" is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies ever. The first time I saw this movie, I was a teenager and I was very impressed with such clever story about this fascinating oppressive society. The visionary Ray Bradbury frightens the viewers with this dramatic sci-fi, not far from the reality in many parts of the world almost forty years later. The awesome Julie Christie, as usual, and Oskar Werner from "Jules et Jim", have magnificent performances. The optimistic conclusion closes this adaptation with golden-key. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): It is a shame, but this movie has not been released on video or DVD in Brazil. Many years ago, a cable and a broadcast television presented "Fahrenheit 451", but this masterpiece was forgotten by the Brazilian distributors. The unique alternative for Brazilian movie lovers that speak English is to buy the American DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing film. I've heard of it for a long time, but only just had the opportunity to see it. The story is based on Ray Bradbury's novel of the same name and has been cleverly adapted to film. There are a lot of clever visual clues in this film, and it stands a couple of watches - just to make sure that you pick them all up! Apparently it is Truffaut's first venture into colour film, and this yields quite interesting results, at times quite colourful. If you are expecting a Sci-Fi film - set in a space-like future, with astounding special effects - you will be disappointed, it's not that sort of film. This is a film where a possible set of scenarios - and 'what-ifs' are put forward, and explored by the filmmaker. It is believable and at times makes you think, 'What if this were true?', I fully recommend this film, a great watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beauty of Books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A world without books, controlled by a totalitarian regime that wants you to get education from what They consider to be permissible. Could this happen? Of course it could; it's happening already at a global scale, as it always has. During the Red Scare for example, our country was immersed in the irrational fear of even knowing someone who sympathized with people who sympathized with Communists and once interrogated, many careers went right down the tubes. In many Latin-American countries, most notably Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, and Dominican Republic, et. al., censorship was the only mode of ruling over a population. Books and songs that were considered "too informative" and quasi-subversive were eliminated, the writer or artist forced to either live in exile or tortured in elaborate schemes to get him or her to 1.) divulge who he or she knew who had leads to the opposition, and 2.) to punish his or her temerity, making an example of what happens to those who transgress against those in power. Germany during the Second World War was known for burning books and unless your name is Mel Gibson, the Holocaust did happen. Until recently, China imposed censorship on certain songs from major pop artists because they were deemed "inappropriate". And on and on it goes.The influence of censorship and a society living under hedonistic ignorance cannot be taken for granted: we're there already, in a subtle form of 1984, the sister story of FAHRENHEIT 451. So much surveillance is imposed on us -- where we go (physically or on the Internet), what television or movies do we see, what music do we listen to, our bank transactions, our purchases, our private conversations, even the question that every employer -- not just governmental -- asks its prospective employee: "Do you or have you ever been affiliated with an organization that has designs to overthrow the American government?" Science fiction has become science fact in more ways than one. Television, once considered a media for education, is certainly that, but more often than not, an object that numbs the mind and taints the spirit with banalities. Programs deemed "too risky" are yanked off the air in lieu of a "more accessible" program. Most recently, former governor Giuliani attacked a painting that depicted the Virgin Mary and was made with elephant dung -- laughable, but a reality. The Government decides, via cute commercials, what prescription drugs and feel-good pills we can use. People have stopped the actual act of writing and e-books are the new thing. We see televised broadcasts of criminals under pursuit and deem this "entertainment". News reports, once reliable, are no more so -- one only has to go back a year to see the CBS scandal. We now have become a nation of extreme (but fake) politeness that enforces an explicit political correctness that hinders actual thoughts even when such thoughts may be offensive.FAHRENHEIT 451 is a film that anyone with conscious thought should see more than once because it exposes all these dark aspects of our own society as seen through a window into the future. The most potent imagery that comes to mind and stays with me is the one of the elderly librarian who has amassed a huge collection of books of all kinds: classics, controversial, historical -- even Mad magazine. Books are information even when they are little more than cute romance novels and easy potboilers, but they exist, thus, they must inform and reflect a person's thoughts. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't commit the act of self-immolation like she does when confronted with the ultimate betrayal -- that of the people designed to protect her. Seeing her light the match that is allowed to fall on top of a heap of books, seeing her look at Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) in ecstatic triumph and extend her arms outward as the flames engulf her entire body, I can't imagine not going out in any other way. Her battle has ended in victory -- there are things worse than dying, and it's her death that has Guy realize the horror of totalitarianism and turn his back on his own life, even at the risk of becoming a fugitive, as he ultimately does.Truffaut and Bradbury, unlike Orwell, shed a light of hope in FAHRENHEIT 451. It's a stoke of genius and a moment of immense beauty -- the one when Guy, now considered dead by the society he once served, meets up with a society of Book People who have been waiting for his arrival. These are people who do what their prehistoric ancestors did: preserve culture, word, by word, and this ensure the future. At a spiritual level, these are enlightened souls who are under preparation for when the time comes to take over the deadened society Guy has left behind. Seeing them introduce themselves, not with their names but the tomes they have become, is remarkable and reflects the lengths to which Man will go to ensure his own self-preservation. FAHRENHEIT 451 is moving on multiple levels, and the dual role Julie Christie plays (Mildred, Guy's wife, and Clarisse, the woman who is the catalyst for his awakening) is casting genius. We see her, a walking, talking Barbie doll at first, and later as the woman she should have been had she rebelled against the drugs and the hedonism imposed on her. One of Truffaut's finest films, and one of the essentials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aren't We Already Here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I get the feeling that, given a few more years, maybe not too many, the only difference between us and the fantasy future in this film is that the firemen of the future will loathe books, criminalize and burn them, while we just ignore them.This bleak picture of the future is Ray Bradbury's, filmed by Francois Truffaut, scored by Bernard Hermann, and starring Oskar Werner, Julie Christie, and Cyril Cusack, with Anton Diffring in a supporting role.The tract houses on wooded lots all look alike. Their inhabitants, including Werner's airhead wife, Christie, spend their time chatting cheerfully about how good things are, when not absorbed by Cousin Pollyanna on the telly. There are no books, of course. Books only make people think and thinking makes people sad. It might even prompt some to dissent. Dangerous things, books.So it's illegal to own them. There is a kind of mailbox in front of the fire station where anyone can drop a note accusing his obnoxious neighbor of owning books. This activates the fire brigade, led by Cusack and crewed by the ambitious young Werner and the jealous Diffring. The firemen board their flamboyantly red engine and sip to the location of the accused, where they tear everything apart in their search for books. If the books are found, they are piled together and set alight with some kind of flame thrower.Out of curiosity, Werner slips one of the contraband books into his tunic and takes it home. Late at night, when Christie is asleep and no one is around, he creeps into the kitchen, turns on the light, and begins reading Charles Dickens' "David Copperfield." He haltingly reads everything on the title page, including the name of the publishers in London and New York. Then he gets to the text. "Chapter One. I am born." Well, I'll tell you -- the guy is hooked. Before you know it he's got a secret library and he's reading everything he can secret away during his raids. His wife finds out, squeals on him, and leaves. Werner's last raid is on his own house but in addition to burning the pile of books on the floor he burns everything, including his boss.On the advice of a criminal neighbor, also played by Julie Christie, he makes his escape to a group of "living books" who have carved a living out of the wilderness. They don't OWN books, so they can't be prosecuted. They ARE books. Their names correspond to the titles of the book that each has memorized. Werner is warmly accepted by the community. He would like to be "David Copperfield" but "we already have a David Copperfield," so he becomes the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe. The final scenes show us people wandering about through the snowy woods, ignoring each other, mumbling aloud the words of the texts they've memorized. Presumably they live happily ever after.The picture rolls along effectively and spookily. The photography is fine and the acting is at a professional level, though I do wish Oskar Werner with his rosebud mouth didn't run as if he were dancing over red hot coals, gracelessly, his elbows raised like an ostrich's.The main problem I had with the movie is that it might have made a good short story but it's a little thin for a feature-length movie.What I mean is that we can already see that the popularity of books -- of carefully crafted reading material in general -- is in decline. Newspapers and weekly news magazines are in Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are both losing readers, while the picture newspapers still glare at us from the supermarket checkout counters. (Latest headline in The Globe, as I write this, "Obama IS a Mulsim.") Another generation and they'll be historical curiosities, although we may still be able to buy broadsheets full of photos of celebrities now grown old and fat. Books are in just as bad a shape. I know this to be a fact because nobody bought my books! Hardly made a dime. And they were just full of penetrating insights, too! (Sob.) Okay. We can accept the decline of literacy as a fait accompli, although we also have to note that among the many books we see curling up in pain in the middle of the bonfires, we don't see any works on science, technology, or math. Everything burnt is a novel or a work of philosophy -- the humanities but not the sciences. Well, that's understandable. When was the last time a quadratic equation generated sad thoughts in anyone? But this problem is never brought up in the movie. As far as the story is concerned, books are books.Another hole in the logic is this: Before books can be loathed, they must become important in social life. No one loathes the moon or a polymerized molecule of nitrogen dioxide because who the hell cares about them? Nobody. They're irrelevant. And that's where books seem to be headed today. Not towards criminalization but towards total irrelevance. U* cnt H8 something U dnt no abt bc Ur 2 dumb.When I was in high school we read "The Great Gatsby" in English class. Out of the hundreds of college students I've taught, there were only two who'd read "Gatsby" -- one on her own and another in an ADVANCED PLACEMENT class. Bradbury and Truffaut are on the right track, I think. Books will disappear. But not because they're illegal, but just because nobody wants them anymore.That future is almost bleaker because it leaves us without any enemy except ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reading Is Bad For Children And Other Living Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury's disturbing vision of a possible future comes vividly alive in this film adaption of Fahrenheit 451. Reading for pleasure is now banned although I imagine you must have a certain degree of literacy to read food can labels and directions to operate all kinds of machinery. But read for enjoyment or for education about the world beyond the small space of earth you frequent, that's a big no-no in this future America.Oskar Werner stars in Fahrenheit 451, he plays a fireman who have a different function in this society. Buildings and such are now fireproof so fireman have become the enforcers of the ban against books. They seek and burn books in whatever quantities they find. A good job in a police state, but not a good one if you have an inquiring mind such as Werner has.Julie Christie plays two roles, Werner's pleasure driven wife and a schoolteacher whose unorthodox for that society's teaching methods have brought her under scrutiny. She does a good job in both characterizations.Bradbury's themes are grounded in reality. Looking at American history it was a crime in many slave holding states to educate a slave. Let them be happy in their ignorance and they might not get ideas about a better life and won't rebel. But this is a society that's beyond that kind of formal slavery so the answer is the old Roman one of bread&amp;circuses. The circus in this case is television which has evolved into an interactive medium. The vast wasteland that Newton Minow characterized television as back in the day has gone beyond anything Minow was having visions about. Entertainment has really dumbed down and the circuses aren't too far from what used to entertain the Romans.In the supporting cast you will remember Cyril Cusack as the fire brigade captain who functions as the spokesman for this new world and Bee Duffring as the book lady who martyrs herself for knowledge in an unforgettable scene.The ending is not Bradbury's, but one written by director Francois Truffaut. It is very much however in the spirit of the novel and a tribute to mankind's unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Don't miss Fahrenheit 451 when broadcast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally a low-budget 1960s period piece, fun and a little creepy, but mostly fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 451 (1966)Directed by a legendary director (Francois Truffaut) and featuring one of the scorching female stars of the time (Julie Christie) and based on a imaginative book by a great American fantabulist (Ray Bradbury) there really has to be something amazing here. And there is, at times, between the cracks.But in fact, Truffaut and his wry, human touch might just be wrong for a futurist film dripping with old school nostalgia (both). Christie is a good, plastic presence, actually, so that's a good choice. And Bradbury may have liked the adaptation but I've read the book and it has some kind of flow and subtlety that the movie misses. There are interesting stylistic comparisons with The Prisoner television series (a semi-nostalgic, futurist cult favorite of its own), which came the next year. Both the movie the t.v. show make great use of small budgets, which is partly where the slightly creaky, slightly endearing, slightly cheesy qualities come in. So what you really end up with, overall, is the story, or even better, the germ of the story--that books are so dangerous to the big brother authorities, they are outlawed.It's a brilliant premise, and the movie is fun, for sure, and interesting. I remember being moved by it (really disturbed) as a teenager, and maybe that's where it resides best. I've tried reading Bradbury as an adult and have some trouble with the emphasis on idea over elegance or depth of character. In fact, as you can see in this movie, there is no depth of character at all. Or, to go an obvious step further, everyone's character is subsumed by something greater, either by choice or by force.This might be the bigger point, implicit throughout, that we are always something lesser than the requirements of life and death around us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting futuristic tale with a clever concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1951 Ray Bradbury novel of the same name. Guy Montag is a firefighter who lives in a lonely, isolated society where books have been outlawed by a government fearing an independent-thinking public. It is the duty of firefighters to burn any books on sight or said collections that have been reported by informants. People in this society including Montag's wife are drugged into compliancy and get their information from wall-length television screens. After Montag falls in love with book-hoarding Clarisse, he begins to read confiscated books. It is through this relationship that he begins to question the government's motives behind book-burning. Montag is soon found out, and he must decide whether to return to his job or run away knowing full well the consequences that he could face if captured...Fahrenheit 451 is a bizarre but also very interesting film. This futuristic tale is obviously about individuality and freedom and it draws some interesting parallels to our society; if you think about it, the film was made in 66, only 21 years after the World War II where too, there was intellectual repression and manipulation trough the media. Visually, the film looks a bit dated, of course, but at the same time, it does look incredibly futuristic and at the time it came out, it must have made an even bigger visual impact. The sets, the props, and the costumes are all amazing and very well done. I don't think I'll ever forget the image of the firefighters in their black sleek uniforms running around in their futuristic red truck. The main character, Oscar Montag was nicely played by Oskar Werner but the films belongs to the insanely beautiful Julie Christie who played the roles of Montag's wife, and school teacher Clarissa. Not only is she gorgeous but she is a delight to watch. Fahrenheit 451 is odd, but it's definitely an interesting film and the concept is quite clever. It deserves to be seen for its originality.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Francois Truffaut's minimalistic and odd take on the classic novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a very "odd" feel to it when you watch it--thanks in part to the unusual and minimalistic sets and special effects as well as the use of an all-European cast. When I first read the novel by Ray Bradbury, I hadn't envisioned Montag and his crew as English-speaking German actors and while this seems a tad strange, it does work. But, this along with Oskar Werner's strangely subdued performance make this a unique film. However, the oddest casting of all was Julie Christie as BOTH Montag's vacuous wife AND his eventual mistress who helps him run away from his job as a fireman.Now in this film, the job of a fireman is VERY different from today's. Instead of putting out fires, the firemen in the movie are agents of the government whose job it is to enforce a total ban on all books by burning them! The logic, we are told, is that books "give people all kinds of silly ideas and lead to arguments and wars". And, the people being mostly idiotic sheep like Montag's wife, they blindly accept this. However, after a while, Montag begins to wonder and think for himself....a VERY dangerous thing indeed!! What happens next and the very bizarre final scenes in the film are really best left for you to discover yourself. I really liked the movie and book, though, because they have so much to say about society and freedom--something that helps this sci-fi story to transcend the medium and provide a wonderful metaphor for modern life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flowers of Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's curious that a director who spent so much of his early career railing against the tyranny of the literary tradition in French cinema should spend so much of his career either adapting novels or filling his films with techniques from and references to literature at every turn, so his attraction to Ray Bradbury's fable isn't that surprising. What is surprising is that in many ways it's his most purely cinematic film, discarding his usual over-reliance on voice-over to carry underwritten scenes for more purely cinematic forms of interpretation. Even the readings from the forbidden books are kept to a minimum: the obsession is in Montag's behaviour, not the words he speaks.Truffaut's playfulness is all over the material, from casting an actor who forbade his children to watch TV or go to the cinema as the fire chief (Cyril Cusack in the film's standout performance) to dramatically masking off half the screen and heightening the dramatic music for what turns out to be a less than dramatic moment in a search ? and that's without the inclusion of Cahiers du Cinema among the burning books or mentioning Anton Diffring's brief moment in drag. But then this is an absurdist world, where firemen slide up poles and start fires and where fascism is accepted in that way it always is when gradually introduced because of people's innate ability to adapt to their circumstances, no matter how absurd or restricting.It improves on Bradbury's novel by losing some of the more distancing sci-fi devices such as the fortune telling dog, and setting it's future in a soulless post-war New Town environment that is close enough to the real look of the time to add to the credibility. Much of what there is in the film isn't that far from reality, with plasma wall screens offering inept interactive' TV (even down to pressing the red button) becoming status symbols, and betrayal increasingly encouraged as an everyday, socially acceptable act. Indeed, the world it presents, where people touch themselves, not each other, and where conflicting ideas are discouraged because they just make people unhappy, seems all too contemporary. Only what is possibly the single worst special effect in film history (those laughable flying policeman on all-too visible wires), the film's one ill-judged excursion into optical effects, sticks out like a sore thumb.Despite the huge problems between Oskar Werner (who wanted to play Montag with a wink and a smile) and Truffaut (who ended the shoot directing through an intermediary, using body doubles and having to cut Werner's takes shortly before he smiled!), Montag seems a credible protagonist, an empty vessel who suddenly has his horizons violently opened. Even the accent seems strangely right: not so much the idea of a German playing a fascist book burner (indeed, Diffring's German accent is dubbed here), but the way it seems to compliment the formal language of the piece. Even Julie Christie's blandness and sporadic awkward enthusiasm work well enough in this environment for her almost to seem to give a perform for once.Throw in Bernard Herrmann's remarkably beautiful, sparingly used score, never more effective than in the final sequences that are almost magically complimented by the happy accident of a totally unexpected snowfall, and the result is a surprisingly moving piece about fundamentally shallow people. And it is a very comforting thought that, if behind every book is a man (or woman), then somewhere there is a man or woman who will keep every book alive despite all efforts to destroy it.Universal's DVD is one of the best on the market: the audio commentary is occasionally unsatisfying, but any gaps are more than filled in by the excellent 45-minute documentary, interview with Ray Bradbury, featurette on Herrmann's score, alternate title sequence, stills and poster gallery and trailer. Highly recommended.MK2's French DVD offers a completely different set of extras, including archive interviews with Truffaut and Christie as well as the director's journal of the shoot, but these are in unsubtitled French. The film itself is in English with unremoveable French subtitles or with a dubbed French track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughably bad version of a classic novel. Totally impossible to take seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury is one of the most talented authors to ever contribute his skills to the sci-fi genre. The man had more imagination in his big toe than most writers today, and his stories range from beautiful optimism of a bright future full of spaceships and exploration to dark pessimism of a destroyed world where books are burned and nuclear war is a fact of life. Farhenheit 451 is, of course, the latter vision. The book is dark and furious, with a story of a future gone wrong that stands up there 1984 and Brave New World as one of the most memorable dystopian novels ever. The movie version is none of that. It's just a big joke. For every dark and realistic passage of the book, there's a cheesy and silly scene in the movie. The cast members don't act, instead they overact, the sets look like they were made for a stage production, the special effects are worse than what was being seen on TV at the time this movie hit theaters, and the script is a lousy butchering of Bradbury's novel. The story is, in theory, about a "fireman" of the future named Guy Montag, who makes a living burning books. The complex, multi-sided character of the novel is now a bland, old, fat man in a tight black uniform who stumbles his way through the film as if he doesn't know what movie he's in. His wife, whose name has been changed for the film for absolutely no reason, is a shrill and insufferable freak. His secondary love interest, inexplicably played by the same actress as his wife...acts exactly the same, despite the two characters being opposites in the book. All supporting characters are similarly shallow and impossible to take seriously, and every last one of them speaks with a different European accent despite the story taking place in America.Montag rides around in a firetruck that's so wacky and childishly designed it looks like a prop from Teletubbies. A man who knows firemen are coming for his books decides to run out of his house, turn around, head back inside, take a bite out of an apple, and then run back outside. The book's famous mechanical hound is replaced by four men in stupid costumes held up by visible wires in front of a miserable blue- screen effect that was 40 years out of date when the movie was made. The list of retarded nonsense in this movie goes on and on; almost every scene contains something objectable.When I think of horrible old sci-fi movies, with bad acting and low production value, this movie comes to mind. It's on the same level as the crap you find in those 50-packs of public domain stinkers. Avoid this movie if you haven't seen it, and read the book instead. If you read the book and really, really want to see the movie, just know that you're in for some laughs instead of a serious, thought-provoking adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film -- Dated, But Still Well Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an oppressive future, a fireman (Oskar Werner) whose duty is to destroy all books begins to question his task.I am torn on this film. While it is an excellent movie, very artistic, and a great adaptation, it also suffers some serious flaws. So while I would say it is quite good, it still could be improved upon in a remake (something I rarely endorse).First and foremost, the English is choppy. It was not written by an English speaker, and it shows. Add to this that the main actor has a heavy Austrian accent, and it may be hard to follow for some viewers.Next, the film seems dated. It has "hippie" elements that are not necessary, and it seems to take place in a similar future as "A Clockwork Orange". I think in the hands of another director (Christopher Nolan or David Fincher), it could be a much darker world and play even better to audiences.I would like to see more of a transition. I was not convinced in Montag's shift -- it seems sudden and the acts that bring it on are just hard to believe. I also would not mind better back story. How did we get to a world where reading is not valued? (If if no one reads, how do characters even know how to read?) Excellent film? Yes. Flawless film? No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury's famous novel about a future society in which books are outlawed gets the movie treatment. And the movie doesn't quite live up to the standards of the book. The basic skeleton of the novel's plot is here but director François Truffaut takes Bradbury's story and makes it his own. And at times the movie suffers for it. Much of the nuance and detail of the novel has been lost. Many important plot points have been changed entirely. But a movie adaptation of a novel doesn't have to be exactly like its original source material in order to succeed. Many novel-based films have changed all sorts of things about the book and been very successful. The problem here is not necessarily that there are changes but that the changes are made to no good effect. The movie's story is not as engrossing as the book's. And certainly not as entertaining. What was a thoroughly captivating book has been transformed into a very dry, often downright dull movie.Right from the beginning, with the first call we see the book-burning firemen go out on, the movie is curiously sedate. The thrill of the novel is gone. The drama just isn't there. The story doesn't grab you. Oskar Werner's performance as the central character of Montag is rather stilted. Either Werner was very uncomfortable in his role or he was going for some kind of effect which just didn't work. The result is the character of Montag leaves much to be desired. And for a movie which is all about that character that's a problem. Montag suffers from a serious personality deficit and so does the movie. There's very little life to it. What little life there is is injected by Julie Christie's character of Clarisse. In a future world where people basically float through life as mindless zombies Clarisse dares to live and it is she who critically, and fatefully, opens Montag's eyes to the possibilities of the written word. Speaking of mindless zombies the other main character is Montag's wife Linda. She lives in a drug-induced stupor, living only vicariously through her wall-screen TV. Christie plays this part too, a neat idea. The contrast between the two women is obvious and that contrast is largely what the story is about, Montag finally seeing another option out there. He sees the chance to actually live a life. He sees what society has become, what has been lost with literature's demise. It was a great story in its original Bradbury incarnation. But greatness eludes this movie version. The book was like lively Clarisse. The movie is more like zombie Linda. The life has been sucked out of it. The basic gist of Bradbury's story remains but with all the changes made the story as presented here is not as compelling and clearly not as entertaining. The book was a real page-turner, the movie is a slowly-paced slog to the finish. In this book-burning tale the best advice is both obvious and ironic. Read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Dimensional Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Francois Truffaut adapts speculative fiction writer Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". The plot? In a dystopian future, firemen patrol the cities looking for books to burn. Books provoke ideas, curiosity, dissent and imagination, the film's fascist state believes, and so all books are gathered and incinerated at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyone possessing a book is placed in a mental institution. Guy Montag, his name recalling a character in Kafka's "The Trial", is one such book burner, though he also lives a secret life in which he passionately reads books. Gradually these book awaken Guy's curiosity. Around him, everyone's popping pills, watching reality TV, waltzing with interactive media and living in a depressingly grim techno-daze (Bradbury's novel is said to have even predicted the invention of the Ipod or Walkman). Surely, Guy thinks, books are a means of fleeing this dreary reality? A means of provoking some form of change? Surely. From here on, "books" become Bradbury's blunt metaphor for any and all "knowledge". But this is a knowledge less suppressed by the state than it is rejected (made clearer in Bradbury's novel) by a hedonistic populace which instead seeks incessant pleasure. In a sense, the books are not ignored because they are burnt, but are burnt because they are ignored.Late in the film, the authorities learn of Guy's book reading transgressions. Like Antoine in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows", Guy thus flees, escaping to the woods where he finds a rebel faction in hiding. Here, each person has committed a different book to memory. They are the guardians of knowledge, the elite minority who preserve texts which have otherwise been lost.Like Bradbury's novel, Truffaut's film is implicitly about the post-literate generation and the death of books at the hands of New Media (the television, internet, the cinema etc). The film begins with television antennas, text-less opening credits, the alternating colours of the visible light spectrum (or old cathode tubes) and features scenes in which books are literally swallowed by TV sets. The "fire engine" of the book burners is itself a Hollywood mobile camera crane/truck. What the film thus charts is man's transition into the post-literate age and the death of both orality and literature. Of course, like Bradbury's future, our Western present is one of criss-crossing multimedia. Writing and reading are still of value, but only in so far as they facilitate the manipulation of other media. The post-literate society assumes traditional literacy skills, but the typical post-literate is a passive literate. Books are read, provided they hook dwindling attention spans or plug directly back into New Media, either via form (ebooks, ipads) or content (celebrity, actor biographies etc). Mentioned also in Bradbury's novel, but not the film, is the idea of a rise in "noncombustible data", a term Bradbury used to refer to an increase in any information that is incapable of producing reflection, analysis, contemplation, comparison, and/or an understanding of how a political, social, or economic system works. What Bradbury essentially predicted was the information age, an age in which everything is accessible, but the sheer volume of information, both junk and otherwise, not only makes fishing a burden, but precludes the need to find, master or apply this information. Truffaut's film was ignored upon release and today still has a poor reputation. This is largely because Truffaut revokes your typical science fiction aesthetic and instead channels, firstly, the retro aesthetics and production design work of 1950s "classic" Hollywood scifi (see "Forbidden Planet"), and secondly, early 50s Hitchcockian opera. Indeed, "Fahrenheit" is one giant love letter to Alfred Hitchcock - of whom Truffaut would publish a book on a year later - with its pounding Bernard Herrmann score, grand emotions, sweeping orchestrations, snappy cutting, bold colours, "Spellbound" inspired dream sequences, 360 degree spins and punchy, whiplash-like camera work. In addition to this, actress Julie Christie plays a pair of double roles (like Kim Novak in "Vertigo") and actor Oskar Werner becomes your typical Hitchcockian running man (as an Austrian outsider who hid from the Nazis, Oskar's real life echoes Truffaut's film). Truffaut even films some sequences backwards, to give the film a dreamy, surreal edge.So at its best, Truffaut channels the baroque, bombastic tone of Hitchcock, which is why "Farenheit" tends to be liked only by those intimately familiar with directors like Hitchcock or Brian De Palma. Like "Fahrenheit", Hitchcock's later films and De Palma's own oeuvre are similarly shunned. There is a perception that this aesthetic style ? expressionistic, dreamy, operatic ? belongs solely to a naive era of cinema. It can not slip past the late 1960s. Today's rise in rationalism and the corresponding rise in insincerity negates Hitchcock's brand of deadpan, sincere expressionism. Though prophetic, Bradbury got two big things wrong. The intellectualism and bookishness that he celebrates was always marginal and elitist. The post literate society simply forces this elitism to take a different shape. His big mistake, though, was in assuming that a future state would ban all art. Today's reality is not the barren, censored, repressed world of Bradbury, but the cultural overload, media-saturation and hyper-hedonism of "A Clockwork Orange". Put art everywhere, give it to everyone, commodify everything and everybody, and you effectively neutralise art, books, objects and people. This is what German philosopher Herbert Marcuse, in his book "One Dimensional Man", called "repressive desublimation". Marcuse saw that postmodern capitalism had "internalised" critique and would increasingly resemble a perverse hybrid of Soviet-style totalitarianism and US-style consumerism. In this world, commodities, art and objects are not just a means of distraction, but the "Ideology" itself. In a world where nothing is repressed, where certain forms of desublimation (freedom) are encouraged, and where everything theoretically can be yours, attention is drawn away from the oppressive and authoritarian character of society, and there becomes no practical grounds for rebellion. Meanwhile, books are everywhere, but nobody reads them.8/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable film, that like a Bordeaux grows better with each passing year. Yes some of the sets will seem very 1960's, but compare to say Logan's Run - these houses, unlike Logan's Secaucus New Jersey Mall, could be in the future. Little parts of nostalgia kept on to make the future all the more depressing. Quirky in that its a British produced movie, based on an American's novel, with an Austrian and an Irish star, directed by a Frenchman. Despite all that its great.This is a love story, a great entertainment and a very scary premise. A future without books. There is nothing in it of a graphic sexual or violent nature, and although psychologically disturbing to an adult will seem rather dull to a small child. It contains the usual prophetic artifacts of a good sci-fi. The TV's are all flat screen and mounted on walls, and to own one is the ultimate status symbol. TV is really bad and housewives are addicted to it to relieve the boredom of their marriages. Nobody seems to own cars and public transportation seems to be the norm.The casting is superb, Julie Christie is sexyfull and subtle, Oskar Werner is a great everyman whose conscience gradually begins to get to him, and the great Irish stage actor Cyril Cusack - Jeremy Irons, father-in-law for you trivia buffs - is sinisterly wonderful. Truffaut's direction and Bernard Herrmann's music ranks among their best work. It will make you want to read Charles Dickens with gusto. I'm stum on the rest of the story. Enter the movie with an open mind, and leave with a desire to read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of the Written Word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time is Ray Bradbury. He was able to look at so many different fantastical things from so many different fantastical angles. Many credit his novel Fahrenheit 451 has his greatest work. It is a book that depicts a future where learning is oppressed and conformity is expected. Government rules with no one ever questioning it. The masses are swayed by what the government wants them to see through television and pills. This adaptation of Bradbury's novel by French auteur Francois Truffault is effective in retaining the heart of Bradbury's work. Oskar Werner plays Guy Montag, a fireman who burns books rather than puts fires out. He is an expert in his field. He can find all the neat, out-of-the-way places people hide their books like in toasters or behind TV picture tubes. Books are outlawed as seen as corrupting forces in society. Only picture books are allowed. Montag goes on with his mundane life with his wife who is always watching television. The status of one is determined by how many TVs you have in the house. Montag doesn't like TV and has an undeniable quench for something more. Anyway, he meets a neighbor like him in spirit and soon decides to start reading. I loved this film because its message is so very clear today and so scary as we live in a society very different from Montag's yet not so far away. TV dominates our lives to some degree. Most of our news comes from it. Much of our bias comes from it. It is definitely a defining instrument in our lives whether or not we wish to admit it. Reading some argue is in a massive decline and our standards as a society certainly have much lower expectations as to what people should know. If you doubt this, just look at a show from the 1960s(even a show like Bewitched or Gilligan's Island) and compare the vocabulary to something made for a similarly aged viewing audience. We dumb down everything. Anyway enough sermonizing, Farenheit 451 will get your mind thinking. Truffault creates plenty of suspense and a wonderfully eerie new future. His use of color in particular really impressed me. It is of course the 60s, but he makes his world look very different. The acting is very good. Werner gives a more than competent performance as a man troubled with a life he finds to be false. Julie Christie excels playing BOTH Werner's wife and the neighbor girl that inspires him to find the true self. I also enjoyed a rare turn by crusty Cyril Cusak! This is indeed an underrated science fiction film and more importantly a film that should be explored as we move closer and closer to that society it showcases. Fortunately for all of us here, we understand the power, the joy, the fulfillment that reading and writing bring us each day. One last note(or two): this was Truffault's first film in English(may be his only one?) and the ending was wonderfully done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid With A Great Look For 1966</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not read the book prior to viewing this film, however I did know the general plot of it. I was pretty sure that I would like this movie, and I really did. It was pretty solid. I don't think it is great by any means, but it is quite good.After watching this I realized that it was made in 1966. Wow. I had no idea. It really looks like something made much later than that. I am impressed at the work that the crew did to make it look as good as it did. I can't help but to compare it to 1984, which is one of my favorite books. I did not like the story as well as 1984, but I guess they do differ quite a bit.I was not all that impressed with the ending though. It felt a little corny to me. It's hard for me to really explain, but it just felt silly. And did that one person really memorize all of Plato's "Republic"? That must have been a tough task.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILER ALERT for movie and book) I have read a bunch of negative comments on this movie and so I just wanted to add my own comments. I haven't seen it lately but I have fond memories of this movie. Montag's cool accent, the lovely Julie Christie, the great Bernard Herrmann score. The opening is very unusual with no written credits, as so many others have stated. I remember the old woman who decides she will die with her books rather than lose them (really spooky idea to this impressionable person), the time when Montag faints, the monorail, the book people at the end which was SO just SO unbelievable -- touching, sad. I mean just imagine memorizing an entire book and that is your purpose in life, to retain that book. And the way they just lived totally without technology is also something that really got to me, since I have lived engulfed in technology/artifice my whole life, it is like seeing people who are totally alien to my way of life, I can't imagine living that way and yet there is something deep inside me that knows that all this technology we wrap ourselves in is ultimately meaningless. During the O.J.Simpson chase being watched on TV someone mentioned how it reminded them of Fahrenheit 451 and this got me to read the book for the first time and in it I was amazed at how accurately Ray Bradbury had predicted the future, our future. From the seashell that people would listen to constantly (walkman) to automatic bankers to kids murdering other kids (HOW did he know that would happen, other than he realized the world was going to hell). Now we have these new kids who are totally and completely absorbed into the TV/movie/internet techno-medium and they can't understand how anyone can like a movie as boring as Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451, which seems to me to again show how prescient Bradbury really was. Society has become faster, flashier, and more meaningless that ever before. Its all just a big show now.But I am looking forward to the remake. Or maybe I'm not. What I would really like to see would be a movie that doesn't so much show how government tries to ban certain literature. See that's really such a crude way of doing things, it doesn't work that way at all here. Our present system is so much more subtle. I would like to see a movie that deals with how this population is kept brainwashed (which it most assuredly is) so that the elites can carry out their agendas without them having to worry about the general population catching on. A movie that would really lay bare what is going on behind the scenes, the manipulation of the masses. A movie sort of like The Matrix but whereas that was obviously fiction in this movie the viewer would toally identify with hapless consumer of infotainment and then get his socks knocked off by seeing how he is being targeted. Now that would be something!So, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend this movie. And if you have and you found it boring, well, welcome to the future :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely fantastic, visually gorgeous, morally challenging, ethically provoking, wonderfully acted, narratively suspenseful film. So there, those of you who posted bad reviews! What is particularly striking about this film is the seductive use of image (it comes across even on TV) of the brilliant reds and blues at the fire station in contrast to the muted greens of the English countryside. This is pure poetry and worth watching for this alone. And surely this is a deliberate paradox built in by Truffaut. In a film that is visually so beautiful it is surely ironic to be praising words and disowning images. indeed, the Cahiers du cinema, for whom Truffaut was a major contributor, attacked the literary influence on cinema in favour of the medium building its own vocabulary and grammar. This is just a random thought, but is Truffaut maybe making a plea here for a more engaged form of spectatorship as well as literature (it is notable that cahiers is one of the journals burnt, we see it in close-up). There is lots more one could say about the plot (and plausibility or otherwise) but I found this film haunting and beautiful. Julie Christie is a bit mannered, but Oskar Werner - wow! Talk about a master class in acting. All those emotions just under the surface. Wonderful stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a thought-provoking and poignant story happens in an oppressive and odd far world , a strange and terrifyingly mechanised society . It describes future Earth civilization with television a universal father-figure poring out messages , there a fireman whose duty is to destroy all books begins to question his task . This is the best adaptation of a Ray Bradbury book to hit the big screen , furthermore quite faithful to the tone of the story. It deals with a fire fighter named Montag ( Oscar Werner ) works in the line of duty as responsible for the destruction of materials , but he begins to question about the necessity of his job . Guy Montag is a veteran fireman who is much respected by his superiors (Cyril Cusack) from fire department and is in line for a promotion . Montag doesn't wonder what he does or why he does it until he deals with Clarisse ( Julie Christie in double role also as Montag's wife ). As his doubts enhance , he starts to rob some books he is about to burn . But a work's companion named Fabian (Anton Driffing) suspects about his hidden activity .It's an intriguing type of story with Science-Fiction leanings and stretching rather far for some of the plot points . This cerebral picture is full of cinematic and literary references as Charles Dickens-David Copperfield- , Robert Stevenson , James Joyce and many others . The interesting story , generally slow-moving , mingles the genres of Dystopian science fiction and suspense film . It contains an intelligent and surprising ending , Truffaut's own invention , with the rebels wandering in idyllic exile by the edge of a glittering icy lake . Although set far in the future , there are no great special effects or elaborate sets ; despite , the movie was filmed in real locations by prestigious cameraman Nicolas Roeg , subsequently filmmaker , in Danebury Avenue, Roehampton, London, England, UK (opening sequence, block of flats) ,Linkway, Edgcumbe Park, Crowthorne, Berkshire, England, UK(Montagu's bungalow)Black Park, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, (Monorail),Fortismere Secondary School, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, UK and Loiret, France , though most scenes were shot in Pinewood Studios . It is colorfully photographed in bright and gleaming red . Suspenseful and thrilling musical score by the classic Bernard Herrmann , Alfred Hitchcock's usual . The flick is stunningly directed by Francois Truffaut , in his fist English-language movie treating the subject of literature and tyranny with a intelligence and dignity not found in other films . This is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨ La Sirene du Missisipi ¨ and ¨Shoot the piano player¨. Rating : Very good , above average and well worth watching .L</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prophetic movie about importance of ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fahrenheit 451" opened to poor box office in 1966 and has been unfairly criticized ever since. Truffaut's fans didn't like his foray into Sci-Fi and away from films about relationships. To Sci-Fi fans the film seemed to lack action and pace. Modern audiences are distracted by effects that were crude even by the standards of the day. An up-to-date, technically sophisticated remake must be better, right? What about Ray Bradbury's mechanical hound? Wouldn't CGI do a great job with that? What about the houses with interior walls that are nothing but televisions that blare advertisements at people? But the nit-pickers miss the point. This film, concerning a society that fears books and employs firemen to burn them, isn't a New Wave or a Sci-Fi film, but a film about ideas.The amazing thing is that Truffaut was able to turn a movie about words into a visual experience without excess verbiage, like fine Hitchcock. The images of books consumed by fire, the disappearing words on paper, speak more eloquently than dialog about a society that suppresses thought, and about the determination of peaceful rebels to preserve humanity's literary and intellectual heritage.Bradbury was disappointed that Truffaut eliminated the Mechanical Hound, a spider-like robot that detects firemen who don't conform and injects dissidents with poison. Given the state of special effects at the time, it's a good thing the hound was not literally interpreted. In the film the fireman's pole detects non-conformity. Bradbury also wanted Clarisse - who challenges fireman Guy Montag's complacency - to be an adolescent as in the novel. But for reasons of pacing Truffaut condenses her character with another from the novel, a former university professor to whom Montag turns for help. Truffaut makes Clarisse an attractive young elementary school teacher, a double for Montag's wife Linda, whose self-obsession exemplifies the ennui and hedonism of a society that has no outlet for it's intellectual and imaginative life.But Bradbury's comments are not all negative. He praises Bernard Hermann's musical score and Truffaut's hopeful ending which differs radically from the novel's apocalyptic vision. At the end of the film the "Book People," who memorize and become their favorite books, are a friendlier, more accessible group than the disgruntled philosophical vagabonds in the novel. Indeed, almost all of the books cited in the novel come from philosophy, whereas Truffaut includes many titles and styles that appeal to a variety of readers in the audience.The casting is perfect. Oskar Werner's German accent as fireman Guy Montag evokes memories of Nazi book burnings; and Julie Christy does an excellent job shifting back and forth in her dual role as vacuous Linda and her intellectually stimulating doppelganger Clarisse.My one regret about the film is that the Fire Chief is such a stereotypical autocrat. In the novel he is a complex human being who simultaneously admires and hates the books he burns; and by drawing a pistol on Montag, who is armed with a flame thrower, he invites is own immolation.The remake by director/writer Frank Darabont will surpass Truffaut's film in every technical aspect. But it will not have Bernard Hermann's magnificent music. Also, a film about the value of the written word will be more of a tough sell to movie audiences of teens obsessed with Youtube and Myspace than to a generation that valued the complexity of ideas expressed in books. Young audiences will care more about CGI effects that don't require a contribution from their own imaginations; and they will ironically confirm that since 1966 we have come closer to the narcissistic society of "Fahrenheit 451" than we dare admit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange and in some ways dated film coming from the period before Star wars when science fiction was about ideas rather than empty fantasies. That intellectual decline is actually predicted by this film and the novel on which it is based.A future authoritarian state has converted the role of fireman from saviour of property to saviour of minds; they now dispense fire from their hoses to destroy books, these being a cause of misery according to the new society. One fireman, Montag, becomes discontented especially because on account of his brain-dead wife who spends her whole life on pills and watching endless amounts of TV (this was made in 1966 based on a book written in 1953, and this aspect of it is extraordinarily prophetic); the TV programmes consist of primitive examples of audience interaction and exhortations to tolerance. After she falls into a coma after an overdose, something so commonplace in that society that the ambulance men are glib about it, he starts to read some books himself.Very beautiful music but also some long meandering sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future man will not have to do anything so extraneous as reading. What he must know is, the state will inform its citizens what to think and what is necessary to be a loyal patriot in a society. In the movie "Fahrenheit 451", written by none other than Ray Bradbury, we have a society wherein a Fireman's job is not to extinguish fires, but to innate them by burning books found among the reading public. Our hero in the film is one Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) who has been a loyal fireman long enough to come to the praise and attention of his Captian (Cyril Cusack) who is thinking of promoting him to higher rank, despite the envy of his co-employee Fabian (Anton Diffring). However things began to hinder Montag's life when he meets, Clarisse (Julie Christie) who creates uncertainty in the young fireman, by challenging him to read a book before burning it. Once he begins to read, he not only evolves into a thinking individual, but in doing so, becomes a criminal. Consequentially, he finds himself hunted and on the run from the very society he once considers the epitome of civilization. This movie is a must for anyone who would like to see a Classic book, transformed into an equal cinematic triumph. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Nearly Unfaithful and doesn't get the whole entire point of the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book in a while so I will try to make my best of it. Sorry If I make mistakes. This is possibly the most unfaithful adaptation of a book ever. The director does not get the point of the Dystopian world and it really begs the question why the film was made.For those who don't know this classic plot, books are illegal in this world. Guy Montag who is a firefighter who burns books gets curious and starts to read books which makes everything go wrong and in the end war breaks out and Guy and other outcasts try to rebuild society. Or so what I remember.The movie is totally different. I'm not going just say I didn't like this because they changed this without giving reason, I am going to give you reasons on why I didn't like the changes.The book was set in the future and it was clear that it was a dystopia. The present is used in this version which makes it look way too modern for an adaptation of a book set in the future.Oscar Werner's Guy Montag is nothing more than just wrong. Tons of things he says and does are excluded from this adaptation such as bursting out in front of his wife's friends after reading a excerpt from a book. The reason this was important was to show that guy was becoming erratic to others around him. When he reads in this version, he just stands there being scolded like a child without doing anything. Oh and the outbreak of war and destruction at the end? Not shown. They just don't show it. Why not?! This is a powerful image in the whole book and it ends with a bang! I don't care if they used stock footage of atom bombs, it would be perfect! They only got very few things right like The woman burning herself with all the books in front of her which makes for a very memorable image. But overall this is just a mess.This is director Francois Truffaut (The 400 Blows) first English film and I severely doubt he had even read the novel and just heard a basic synopsis without the details. Just please read the book. Don't support this film it is a huge mess. 36/100 D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy movie, but we now have the big screen TVs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reflections and observations: I saw this movie when it was new. I just saw it again tonight. I had seen Julie Christie as the stern grandmother in Finding Neverland. In 451, she plays two roles. In Neverland, she is way older, of course. Another of her early movies was Dr. Zhivago, in which she is a beautiful romantic lead. She plays a brave book-reader in 451, as well as the fireman's numbed out wife.1966 was during the time of Soviet Union repression stories we read about in U.S. If we were called a nation of sheep at that time, this movie underscores how the future could be composed of nothing but cookie cutter people who are boring zombies and do not think for themselves. I know that the novel 451 was written in the McCarthy era, also a time of conformity and not a lot of people thinking for themselves. It was a post-WW II world where people felt lucky to be alive and able to start over. Lots of new housing developments included similar ticky tacky houses; every one looked the same. In 451 movie, houses were, yes, different, but women visitors in the fireman's house all reeked of sameness and lame stupidity. This was all in fitting in with their government's totalitarian repression of all independent thought.Oskar Werner was excellent. He reminded one of a chilling Nazi toward the beginning of the movie. His supervisor was even creepier, when he chastised and punished the employees who had gotten in trouble. Montag, as he read the books later on, became almost human.The young men getting yanked off the street because of their long hair was really creepy, too. Some of their hair styles didn't look so dated, considering that since 1966 men have worn these similar styles many times.The woman burning the books and then herself was very heroic. She was a tough old bird, and Montag seemed to start to melt along with her.Montag torching his books and then his supervisor was shocking. The supervisor (captain) certainly had it coming, even though he was only following his government's orders.Here's to freedom to read, write, view, watch, speak, draw, paint, act, photograph and broadcast to our heart's desires. Let us continue to believe in our freedoms, and to never have the Nazi-like chilling type of life as depicted in this movie.The fireman uniforms were super cool (design-wise) and well-tailored. The helmets reminded me of the messenger Mercury. I liked the monorail commuter trains. I have been in similar ones at Disney World. Wish we had them where we live; updated ones, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but didn't quite satisfy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 451 is the first adaptation of Ray Bradbury's well-known novel. It describes a dystopia where owning books is illegal. The firemen have the duty to hunt down and burn any hidden books, which is where Guy Montag comes in. After receiving a promotion as a fireman, he gains some smuggled books and becomes interested in reading. Obvious struggles arise to create a compelling plot.The use of color was good but the camera-work was only decent. The acting was pretty good from Oskar Werner as Montag, but otherwise lacking. I found the music to be distracting. It was fitting and original by itself, but the editing was poor and the theme was overused. Maybe a lot of these problems arise because of the age, but usually I'm fine at watching older films.The plot is the strong point of the film. It carries a powerful message and leaves a strong emotional impact. The dystopia atmosphere was effective. It made me feel like I was experiencing the events. The irony (for example, firemen were pyromaniacs rather than our usual image of rescuers) helped keep things fresh. The only problem I noticed was that some of the events were not clearly tied together. Some of the scenes just seemed out of place.Overall, the technical problems hinder Fahrenheit 451 from being a great movie. It has all the potential for success with the material, but doesn't quite reach the finish line. It is still a decent movie and worth watching. It just doesn't offer anything to push it above the average movie.</fullReview>

For me, Fahrenheit 451 is his most stylish and successful work. Cool, crisp, and visually breathtaking, the film manages to strike a balance between whimsical social satire and serious political nightmare.As a teenager, I found the film weirdly engrossing - but a very strange way to adapt the book, which I loved. Seeing it again as an adult, this odd little movie looks better than ever. Not only does it achieve a startlingly effective fairy-tale quality lacking in the novel, I believe it rises above its source material to become a true work of art in its own right. Kind of like Kubrick's The Shining. It is not only a visual masterpiece, with a creepy sterile atmosphere and disturbingly masked performances, it gets better with time like a vintage wine...and, in the long run, gets the recognition it deserves.A CLASSIC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has a quality but don't burn the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Minor spoilers]François Truffaut's 1966 film vision of the Ray Bradbury novel is not a typical science fiction movie. Unlike most futuristic totalitarian dystopias in movies, "Fahrenheit 451" is a low-key almost pastoral film.The story has become a classic. A near future society has outlawed all books. Their reasoning is the need for everyone to be the same, have the same ideas and the same aspirations. Television is the only mass media permitted and its content is banal, unchallenging and simpleminded. To enforce the book ban, firemen have evolved into official arsonists who find, collect and burn all books.Montag is one of the firemen. As played by Oskar Werner he is a quiet ordinary conformist. His wife Linda, played by Julie Christie, is a typical person of this age. She is a pill popper who is self-centered, vain, unemotional and dull. Montag's mild discontent gets serious when he befriends a free spirited neighbor (also played by Julie Christie) and becomes interested in the books he burns.Much about this movie is interesting but overall it lacks energy. The dialog and plot seem as tranquilized as the characters themselves. Truffaut was probably deliberate in his "feel" for the film. However there is little suspense. The society should be oppressive and stifling to give credence to the need for rebellion. Instead few people appear to be really suffering. Most citizens are affluent, polite and well fed even if they are mindless hedonists. What little dramatic violence there is is directed against the books with close-ups of paperbacks succumbing to flame.There are high spots in this movie. The movie credits are not printed on the screen but are spoken instead. The most interesting characters in the movie are the "book people" who memorize and take the names of a favorite book.The look is a bit low budget and dated but not unusual for 1960's science fiction. Apparently a remake is in the works and will probably run to the other extreme of CGI and special effects.The best recommendation is to read the original novel. The many movie plot holes (such as how people can read in a bookless society) are explained. The depth of repression is thoroughly experienced. Most important the reader understands the consequences of a world where intellectual diversity is taken away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many subtleties in this movie. First, the opening credits being entirely spoken rather than printed on the screen. Second, the double casting of Julie Christie as Montag's wife and as his new romantic interest-- in other words, we keep falling for the same person. Third, the parallel between the 'book people' who spend their lives reading and reciting books, and the 'TV' people, who spend their lives glued to the set and playing silly interactive games with it-- it would seem that, as opposed to the book, the movie is asking whether one obsession is actually any better than the other. Fourth, the movie successfully predicted, or at least anticipated, the Walkman and other earphone devices, as well as anonymous crime-reporting phone-lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut adapts a hard edged, frightening, and hopeful futuristic action/drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most exciting, incendiary, and poignant films of Francois Truffaut's career. Any problems that happened off the set (fueds between Truffaut and star Oscar Werner) are not prevalent here- this is a film that with its style captures the kind of thought process behind Ray Bradbury's classic futuristic cautionary tale. I read the book in high school, and loved it, but hadn't seen the movie till recently. It was hard to remember most of the book (coincidentally a theme in this film is remembering what books give us), but I remembered the major points- Guy Montag (here played by Werner) is a fireman, putting out books with fires. Like a gestapo rooting for prisoners for the concentration camp, they ransack homes they find suspect, and torch all the books in sight. The thought behind this, the boss says, is that books are what tear people apart. Instead, television is the enlightenment of the masses (sound familiar).Montag doesn't question much of this until he meets a woman, Clarisse (Julie Christie, curiously enough in another role as Montag's stagnant, common wife), who tries to instill Montag a meaning with books. This also flies over his head until he meets a professor or other, who somehow also stirs the bug in Montag. He starts to slip a book here and there during the fire raids, and is drawn in. It leads up to a kind of revolution in Montag's mind-set, where to run away from it all is the only choice left. These scenes are filmed with an intensity and urgency that is trademark in Truffaut (i.e. most of 400 Blows, certain parts of Jules &amp; Jim) and on a sensory level gets to one almost above most other regular thrillers. We care about Montag, the sort of empty vessel that is starting to fill in, and it leads up to a somewhat funny, but rewarding finale.Truffaut, learning from one of his masters (Hitchcock), not only gives Bradbury's story that extra push in certain scenes (and certain restraint for psychological effect, i.e. scenes at Montag's house with his wife), there is a certain originality that gets to the viewer emotionally. During a couple of key scenes when the firemen are burning up the books, in particular with an old woman with the biggest hoard of them, he presents a montage of close-ups, all the various books and pages burning. This is a directness that would not have been found in Hollywood at the time, and it brings out the sense of loss that clouds over this society in the film. While many of the satirical points in the film are Bradbury's, and the ring truer today than ever before (control, suppression of intelligence, control of the Government with the media), Truffaut's job of filming it is key and ultimately very successful. There are also the performances turned in; Werner, maybe not as good as in Jules &amp; Jim, makes a believable Montag, even through his struggling English; Christie, juggling between two completely different characters, pulls it off; Cyril Cusack as Montag's boss is like one of those villain roles that often gets overlooked in polls, as he really gets you to despise this character. One must also not overlook Bernard Herrmann's tense score, and eye-popping cinematography from Nicholas Roeg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unintended prediction of the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author himself stated the book was written to "pay the bills", and neither the original book, or the original film were commercially successful. It has become a classic because it fits the definition of the term of art - it is a classic. It avoids topical subjects, avoids identifying with one political viewpoint (the books burned go from Mein Kampf to the Communist Manifesto), and it focuses on a universal constant - human nature's desire to find a place in the world, happiness, and above all the need to love. Book burning, and more specifically, the control of divergent ideas is not a new phenomenon. Many people who watch this movie are troubled by it because they are subconsciously reminded that ideas and people that we do not like or understand. Perhaps what troubles us about this movie is that we see books that we divide into three categories; burn, don't burn, and who cares? Is there anyone familiar with the book titles, who did not see one book they enjoyed being burned, or one book they wanted to retrieve from the fireman's torch? You can't be human and be without prejudice. Unfortunately the word prejudice has been burned by the thought police of today. Without personal opinions, some may call them prejudices, a human being becomes a hollow personality. The "controlling" influence in this movie does not want its citizens to think outside the proper channels. 451 shows that despite the most stringent and effective controls, some people will give up everything for the one thing that really matters - a free will to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly unnerving experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film recently for at least the fifth time and continue to react to it with a certain sadness. The book burning, of course, is atrocious, but the character of Montag is what causes the sadness. He seems so confused about his feelings towards being a fireman and his increasing fascination and love of books brought on by his contact with Clarisse. Even at the end, which I find one of the most depressing endings ever in the moviesA few observations upon this recent viewing: why is Montag afraid to use the pole in the firehouse once he starts his fascination with books? Does the captain really find the woman who is about to burn herself with her books attractive? Just caught the meaning of the captain pronouncing "burn all of the books" as he hold up a copy of Mein Kampf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another film, like The Time Machine earlier this month, that makes me want to put down my copy of 1984, which I am also reading. The three of these dystopian futures predicting a world in which there is no written word, or the books themselves are purposely destroyed, makes me want to stay in my blanket fort all day clutching my copies of Harry Potter. In Fahrenheit 451, we meet Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) who works as a fireman; only in the future, firemen exist to start fires to burn books. One can quickly see that Montag is not fulfilled by his work. Even at the news that he will be receiving a promotion, he is not satisfied with himself. One day he meets a woman on the transport, Clarisse (Julie Christie) who seems to be fascinated by the simpleton soldier he seems to be. She sees more in Montag, soon after the audience realizes there is more to see in him as well. He goes about life as a loner, mindlessly carrying along with the other firemen at the station, and even more mindlessly with his wife at home. One can soon tell he is quite conflicted by his work to burn and destroy literature. One morning, a distressed Clarisse urges Montag to go with her to the school she has just been fired from. School is a terrifying place in this film. All the children dress the same and repeat the same learning rhymes no matter the age. Hearing the echoes through the building as Montag and Clarisse pass through the halls is deafening, as the audience realizes that this generation of children will never even know books to have existed. There is no turning back for Montag when one of the calls that his unit responds to is to burn an entire home library. The owner of the home repeats one of the rhymes drilled into the school children's heads before proceeding to set herself on fire among her books, because she would rather burn with them than live without them. It is at this moment that Montag stops feeling so alone, he knows there are people that feel as strongly about books as he does. He must flee to a place where he is accepted, and Clarisse knows just the place. She directs him to a land in which people memorize books and live amongst each other in the peace of their literature and free of the fear that anyone could ever take anything from them, because they themselves become the books.A future without written word looks like a scary place. Montag's home was barren and bleak, with only a telescreen for entertainment. Set design stood out the most for me throughout the film. It was a large task to undertake to make television look dismal, and the art department does a wonderful job of making this a reality. The sterile look of Montag's home made me feel as though I was watching life in a hospital. In a way we are watching life in a hospital, entertainment is mandated, emotions are nonexistent, and it seems as though everyone is just waiting to be done. As Montag remarked, in this world, you're not living, you're just killing time." In addition to the set design, the film was beautifully scored, as legendary Bernard Herrmann lent his talents to this film. Herrmann was also famously behind Citizen Kane, Psycho, and Taxi Driver. Scored beautifully, the audience is entranced by a world so different, and hopefully distant, from our own.The literal theme of burning books is not simply a relic of Nazi Germany. Even today, the fight over school textbooks rages on. We are constantly fighting a battle within our own society on what to permit and what to omit of our own history. This film serves as an adequate warning that we must accept even the darkest parts of our history must be reported and learned from or the all too real possibility of what took place in Fahrenheit 451 could be reality. On a less surface level, one can learn from seeing how much Montag went along sullenly through his life to do something that you find meaningful in life. Rendering your life as a big exercise in killing time will certainly leave you empty, as Montag was before he joined the book people. One must do what makes them come alive and do whatever that is fervently, as to live their own life to its fullest potential. Fahrenheit 451 provided a prudent example of the psychological pitfalls to avoid in life, a reminder we all need as we become submerged in simply going through the motions.As beautiful of a film as Fahrenheit 451 is, I would recommend this film to all students of film. A sensory experience such as this is not to be ignored by those seriously interested in filmmaking. It almost goes without saying that it is a necessity for any fans of Truffaut to see Fahrenheit 451, as well. I've been indebted to François Truffaut ever since the first time I saw Jules et Jim. I was completely blown away by this film and vowed to see as many works from the French auteur as I possibly could. Fahrenheit 451 did not disappoint, if I had the experience to do over, however, I would probably not watch this film at the same time as reading George Orwell's 1984, as I'm now searching the internet for safes for all my books</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truffaut's first color film and his one and only UK venture, a significant fiasco at its release and also soured by the severe feud between Truffaut and the leading man Oskar Werner. Nevertheless, 48 years later, this dystopia drama continues glistening with its profound social message of a near future where books are banned from its ostensibly harmonious but substantially benumbing and oppressive society, adapted from USA Sci-Fi writer Ray Bradbury's eponymous novel. Notably, its futuristic mise-en-sc?ne and Nicolas Roeg's phenomenal cinematography are endurable by the time, may even surpass the film itself. In a world the duty of firemen has delegated from putting out fire to burn books, Guy Montag (Werner) is a promising fireman waiting for a promotion, yet after he meets his nonconformist neighbor Clarisse (Christie), who seems to be a rebel against the claustrophobic atmosphere. Her ideology influences Guy bit by bit until he is intrigued to the items which he demolishes on a daily basis and clashes with his more orthodox wife Linda (Christie again), sooner or later, he has to face a fatal blow of betrayal and transforms him as a "bookman", the most innovative notion under this repressive law to thwart the extinction of great books, each individual memorizes one of his or her favorite books, and names oneself as the title of the book, thus they become "bookmen", living in the wilderness but legally, and pass on their books to the next generation, so books are not needed in their physical form, until one day, this fatuous ban is lifted. Such a beautiful concept (despite how demanding it is), instead of resorting to revolutionized violence against the authority, the intellectual ones contend with wisdom and perseverance, which could only happen in a Utopian realm. By and large, acting is not the biggest merit in this film, Werner's Guy Montag is blasé, civilized but simmers with defiance, yet he is no way Briton, thanks to the fact future will also be unbeknown-st to us, it doesn't seem to be too out-of-place. Julie Christie is as beautiful as always in her duo roles, with long tresses, she is Linda, a housewife indulges in the vapidness of her life and too blind to stand behind her husband, and wearing a clean short-cut, she is the dauntless Clarisse, fighting with a cause. Cyril Cusack is the authoritarian firemen squad captain, whose speech of why books should be all eliminated even temporarily wins me over since he is so persuasive in singling out the flaws in literature, but is also farcically written off with torrid perfunctoriness.As a Truffaut's ambitious project, the film does fully exhibit an omnipresent sense of neurosis, a world is restless under its placid surface, its visual patterns are distinctively impactful, the hanging shuttle trains, the simplistic designed fire engine, the flaring shots of books in the inferno, page by page, it is enthralling to deposit our curiosity into this cathartic ride with Guy, to revive the sensation of our own existence, and its ending does proffer a feel-good superiority towards the wacky idiocy of the stifling sameness. Also it is funny to envision a remake in the digital era, how Amazon, Kindle, iTunes Store and other online stores can be clamped down into extinction? Is it an onerous stretch for our valiant firemen?</fullReview>

Perhaps I am ignorant, although I am fairly certain that is not the case.The basic story is not outdated. I haven't read the book, but it is likely that it is not boring as I understand it is quite different from the movie.I watched the movie using my computer screen. After about half the movie had played I watched the rest of the movie with the window size reduced whilst browsing. Perhaps there is some irony given the movie's (book's) basic storyline.I got the basic message within a few minutes that this was a story about 'big brother', freedoms, and the impacts on social interactions. I waited for the story to develop, but it simply stepped through fairly predictable stages to an uneventful finish.Perhaps a remake will present the story in a better way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 451</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this dystopian vision of the future based on the famous novel by Ray Bradbury, books have been banned and firemen have moved on from putting out house fires to setting books on fire. Instead of reading, people are encouraged to watch multiple TV sets simultaneously and participate in the programs by reciting lines sent to them previously. Still, many people hide books in their homes, despite the constant risk of being ratted out to the officials. In spite of his promising career, a fireman named Montag (Oskar Werner) has grown disillusioned with his life and boring wife Linda (Julie Christie), and after meeting a young school teacher Clarisse (also Julie Christie) he starts dabbling in reading books himself. The people around him aren't happy about his new attitude to life, however.The retro-futuristic production design looks good and Oskar Werner is believable in his everyman role, but there are things in the film I didn't like as much. Considering the calm pace the story advances at, the dramatic music and often restless camera-work seem out of place. There are a few too many zooms to my taste and some of the movements in Montag's house, for example, felt distracting to me. These are only minor complaints though, as there are many impressive scenes in the film too. The raiding of a hidden library and the subsequent tragedy, Montag's dream sequence, the final chase and the poetic ending in the forest are all well done, focusing more on atmosphere than action or special effects (in the whole film there is only one badly dated SFX shot near the end).In spite of my complaints above, in the end I think Fahrenheit 451 is an enjoyable film and captures the feel of the book well. To be a suspenseful thriller, it would have needed more sense of raising tension before the finale; now it feels a little flat in its storytelling, but the overall atmosphere in the film's world is captivatingly oppressive in any case. The message about the importance of rejecting ignorance is still relevant in our times, and the film supports Bradbury's novel efficiently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a classic era of science fiction literature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You say "science fiction" in 2010, and many people either roll their eyes or laugh. Perhaps due to to a lot of hacks jumping in and churning out fast food stuff masquerading as sci-fi, or just the over-saturation of the genre.This was a Ray Bradbury classic, and it was treated with care and respect when it was adapted to a movie. There were many stories contemporary to this in style, pointing to a stark and oppressive future. A world where liberties now taken for granted no longer exist. Often, someone serving as an unwitting cog in the wheel of such oppression would begin to question what was going on, and personally revolt against it. Such is the framework of 451.The brutish future Bradbury envisions wants to suppress independent thinking (another common theme in such movies). The methodology is to destroy any and all printed literature, and arrest anyone found to be in illegal possession of it. "Firemen" are those whose duty it is to locate such materials and destroy them. (The idea of putting out fires is long since obsolete, in a culture where structures are impervious to this danger.) The film is suitably dark and ominous, typifying the darkness of such a petrified culture. The hero, a rogue fireman, finds himself a hunted felon, a political enemy to even his own friends and family. The robotic-looking uniforms complete the imagery of a society that is both stagnant and opposed to thoughtful reason. The movie faithfully captures the spirit of the Bradbury work, and wends its way inevitably towards its decisive conclusion and strong message. For any fan of vintage science fiction, where imagination and vision were the focus; not endless techno violence devoid of meaning. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Fahrenheit 451 SPOILERS* Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman in a not-too-distant future where, instead of putting out fires, firemen ignite them, by burning books which are considered dangerous by the Government (because they require actual thought process, and in The Government you just can't have it) and replaced with television programmes which are meant to uniformize and dumb down the general audience(sounds familiar? It should).Until now, Guy has done his job without any problems, but when he meets a young teacher called Clarissa (Julie Christie) he'll begin to see another side of the picture, to the dismay of his wife Linda (Julie Christie again)...The only Truffaut movie in English, this is an intense trasposition of the epochal book by Ray Bradbury, acted very well and faring almost ace in all the other categories, too.The idea of having the opening credits spoken and having written words only at the end is genius.My only displeasure is that there is a little too much detachment from the actions on screen, but probably there won't be in the next version, which will be directed by Frank Darabont.The subtitles in the DVD's Extras could've been left, though.Fahrenheit 451 (1966): 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it doesn't wear well visually these days, this is still a really interesting film. With Francois Truffaut as director, it is a work worth watching. A society that has eliminated the printed page (a step beyond 1984 where the printed page is a vehicle to an end), becomes a sterile, emasculated society. People are only allowed to read stylized comic books. I'm not sure why because this is a visual medium as well. Nevertheless, we have the rebel who wishes to return to the past and the right of expression. The powers that be have a fire department that burns things rather than putting them out. In this case, they seek out the old libraries of people and decimate them. The scary thing is that even today, there are people whose jobs are to change historical documents. This fire department takes great delight in its mission. They are seen as the saviors of the world, as they drive their funny little fire trucks. Mommy, there are the firemen. There's going to be a fire!" At times it's sort of laughable in its presentation. I think it's because, even if such a society were to exist, would it be like this? Then, again, it's Ray Bradbury. He has a sense of romanticism, and would envision something as elaborate and clean as this society. I guess I would see a totalitarian government as rather bleak and oppressive (not that this isn't. It just seems so clean). Of course the ending requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. I won't spoil it, but it really sounds like a great idea, even if it is probably unlikely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Ray Bradbury's excellent futuristic novel of a totalitarian society that is dedicated to burning all written works(books especially). Firemen are used to do the burnings(since fireproof materials are the norm now, the purpose of fireman is reversed). One such fireman, Guy Montag(played by Oskar Werner) has a change of heart after he falls in love with a beautiful dissident book reader(played by Julie Christie, who also doubles as his bored and drug-addicted wife) who leads him on an adventure that will forever change his life, and how he looks at the world...Beautifully directed by French director Francois Truffaut, who creates an effective colorless view of this oppressed society that wallows in ignorance. The plot is still timely, whether it's books being burned, or language being twisted, or history revised...themes that are sadly timeless. Ending is especially exquisite, though of course by the film's inherit subject matter, the approach is emotionally distant, even cold, which is certainly reflected by the end setting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an oppressive vision of the future, firemen no longer put out fires, but rather burn books. A member of the force, Guy Montag, begins to doubt that this is the right thing to do. I have not read the novel albeit I love Bradbury, so I can make no comparisons to this particular book(I will say that this is very much in his spirit), and this is the first film by Francois Truffaut I watch, so I can't say if this is typical for him or not. While this can be called sci-fi, it is not futuristic or FX-driven(the few there are vary in quality). We see technology that did not exist at the time(some of it does now... and it had the effect that Ray predicted!). This is done with a deep love of literature(and the quoting of some are incredible), from the original author and the director alike. To fight this free exchange of ideas is a serious step towards blind conformity and a clear indication of a fear of what is different, a level of insecurity about how one is doing things, and the movie gets this across wonderfully. Society is held to unreasonable standards, and everything is streamlined, controlled(as an example of the amount of surveillance, the "police" have headshots of everyone(not only those who have already been arrested for something), and can easily find the address of anyone). The people are sedated with constant television(inspiring unrealistic hopes and dreams to keep them from starting a revolution), superficiality, and actual drugs(not forced like Equilibrium, or at least not as far as we know). The married couple barely relate to one another, hardly know each other, there's a strong sense of isolation(helped nicely along by the sparse cast, all of whom, including the children, deliver impeccable performances), and it leads to narcissism(or everyone being famished for connection, even only a physical one, as a direct result of the denial of an intellectual life). This is tense and has some great visuals. It is not without silliness, if these instances are few and far between. Most of the chances it takes work out; note how little this shows the printed word. The opening credits are read aloud, as the camera zooms in on one antenna after another(everyone now uses this pasttime... obviously, this is less compelling today, as we have taken a large step towards the terrible reality presented here). This is well-written, dialog and plot alike. There are exceptions, where things seem... off. I don't know, I can't quite place it, maybe it's a French thing, I'm not that familiar with the culture. Those who are may not agree with me on that point. This evokes the imagery of Nazism and the totalitarian nature of the government in this becomes increasingly clear to the viewer as this progresses. The running time is just below 110 minutes, and there are some sequences that feel a bit slow. There is disturbing content(the ratio will depend on one's tolerance... those who appreciate libraries will find this very harsh indeed) and a little violence in this. The DVD comes with a highly interesting and informational commentary track by crew as well as Julie Christie(the female lead, and don't you dare read who she portrays until you've watched the entire thing), three documentaries that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, a photo gallery and the old introduction to this. I recommend this to any fan of the concept and those who created it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needing a new version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Ray Bradbury's book. It's just amazing how this 1951 story prefigured a lot of things from our current society. From big flat screens to people with Ipods stuck to their ears day in and night out, to stupid TV reality shows, everything is in the book, including the pervasive loneliness that has become a signature of our times, even if we are surrounded by technological gadgets that are supposed to bring us together. It's not difficult to visualize Montag's wife watching Big Brother while writing inane half written sentences in Facebook. Because the book is so current, it was very difficult for me to watch this movie; I have no problem with retro-futuristic 1960's sci-fi (I love Voyage to the bottom of the sea, for God's sake!), but I repeat, the story is so 2011 that the production design and cheap visuals don't involve me. Besides, the focus of the story is completely changed. Montag goes through a journey of discovery where he desperately tries to take her wife along, but she refuses to leave her dumb, comfortable life style; in the movie, most of Montag actions seemed to be inspired by his love of beautiful Clarisse, and I think that downplays the importance of such awakening. Both Oskar Werner and Julie Christie were wonderful actors, but here they are completely comatose, as it's the direction from Truffaut. The ending is particularly bland. In short, I found the movie pretty boring and uninvolving. In general, a movie that left me wanting for something more. I guess it's just that I liked the book so much that I'm not being fair judging it on cinematic grounds only. I really hope we can get a new version set in a near future, with a good script and a good cast; it would be very relevant in these days where classic and thoughtful books are ignored by most people and the books best seller list includes only Dan Brown's and biographies of trashy actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a gem of a movie. Way back in 1966 we see flat screens, Kindle-like devices and a vision of a society lulled into existence (not real living) through the constant presence of one holy and ever-present social networking mass-media. Sound familiar? Personally I love the retro-fashions and furnishings which actually wouldn't be too out of place today - there's a certain "Ikea" vibe to some of the furnishings. Julie Christie is radiant in her dual roles both as an automaton of a wife and a passionate teacher. I don't know how she did it.The message of this movie is quite timely and clearly we have not heeded it. In our race to "go paperless" will we soon be living in a sterile society such as this?

		<fullReview>In a totalitarian future society, books are banned and firemen are employed to burn them. Montag is a well-respected fireman who finds himself increasingly bored by social norms and attracted by the mystery of reading. Will he be found out ?This is a great science-fiction movie, which doesn't really look or sound like any other, and the central idea is a terrific one. What better way to keep a population controlled than by removing the main source of all knowledge and enlightenment ? It doesn't explore fully how society could function without anything written down, but a world full of dull pill-popping layabouts who live only to watch TV and rearrange their furniture is still frighteningly close to the truth. Truffaut's direction is first rate. Aided by an intense score from Bernard Herrmann, he employs several stylish touches, like the spoken credits (no reading of course), jump cuts, excellent use of slow motion and disorienting side angles and crane shots which heighten the sense of unearthly unease. The style is jarring, in an extremely effective way, and the photography by Nicolas Roeg is sensational. If the film has a flaw, then it's the performances. The support cast are okay, but Werner's character arc from model citizen to guerrilla bibliophile is unconvincing. Christie is a bit better in a dual role but too happy-smiley subdued - she could have made the wife more poisonous and the revolutionary more passionate. I guess the acting was difficult in a movie with such an extreme concept, but it doesn't really matter - the film has so much else going for it that it's never less than intriguing, entertaining, scary, even funny (there's an amusing throwaway shot of a burning copy of Cahiers Du Cinema). Whilst it's not as well known or regarded as some science-fiction pictures, the influence of this film in its depiction of a dystopian police-state cannot be underestimated, and you can see its themes recur in flicks as varied as Escape From New York, The Neverending Story and Brazil. A fine, thought-provoking movie; Truffaut's only in English. Scripted by the director and Jean-Louis Richard (the screenwriter of Emmanuelle), based on a great book by Ray Bradbury.</fullReview>

The theme of government thought control isn't new but Bradbury's treatment of book burning is.One thing to watch for in the movie is the ubiquitous presence of spy cameras. Talk about prescience! Today spy-cams are every where, though not necessarily planted by the government.The larger question Bradbury presents to us is how do we store knowledge, data, memories? As the movie shows, analog storage can be wiped out by fire. But if we choose to rely on digital storage as we do today, we are vulnerable to solar and cosmic storms that could destroy out data base and thus our civilization.But that's another story and perhaps another classic sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The atmosphere of this film is bleak and sterile. The landscape is like a watercolour painting, pale and lifeless. The people speak in a measured, passionless way. (It was Truffaut's first English language film and the difficulty that made for him with the actors actually adds to the texture. A happy accident!) People like Montag's wife are lulled into quiescence with endless television and drugs. On his train home Montag doesn't notice the dreamy state people are in. There seems to be a childishness about life. Note the way the two trainee firemen are scolded like little boys.Into this sterility come two forces. One the flare of the firemen's flame thrower burning books to ashes, and the startling red of the fire engine cutting through the landscape. The other is writing and literature, suppressed because they make people dissatisfied and unhappy. Caught between these forces is Montag and the film is the story of what happens to him in this dilemma.Oskar Werner plays it very low key and it works great. He is strangely compelling. Julie Christie has two contrasting roles and her plaintive voice is right for both characters. Cyril Cusack as the fire chief is also low key but in his case makes his character frightening. There are many good scenes; the uncle teaching his nephew a book, the overdose scene, the first book burning, Dickens being read to some women, and the last one is very uplifting and moving. Real books get burned in the film though and if you are a book lover it is painful! With driving and also poignant music by Bernard Herrmann it adds up to a really good film. It has not received due praise over the years but if you get into its mood it is a rewarding film. Although made in 1966 it has not dated like other science fiction films of that era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie, I liked it very much. The reason why I did not give it a 9, and I gave it a 10 is that the beginning really got to me. I like how they did the credits. If they did not do credits like that I would of gave it a 9. Another thing that I really liked was the music during the spoken credits, it sounded like something from The Twilight Zone. (NOTE: I also like the music through the movie itself.) I think that François Truffaut did a great job at making this movie, and writing the script. There is only two things that I really did not like about the movie, which was sometimes it was hard to understand what they were saying (the difference between the English English and the American English.) and it seem the editing could of had some work done on it. But thats about it. (WARNING: SPOILER {I think}) One thing for some reason that shocked me in the movie is when the captain held up a book in an old ladies house and the book was the book that Hitler wrote which was "Mein Kampf." I enjoyed it very much, this movie might not be for all people, but for most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly unsatisfying but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut's first and only film in English, Fahrenheit 451 is not his best, probably due to problems with communication, Truffaut and Oskar Werner's disagreements on the set and the fact that the setting is an uncomfortable mix of obviously 1960's Britain with some futuristic sets and costumes.One of the biggest causes for the slowness and the certain detachment of the film is caused by Oskar Werner, an Austrian actor who is not bad, but not very charismatic and a distinct accent that remains unexplained in the film.There is a constant sense of movement, though, carried out by Montag, probably inspired by Hitchcock's I Confess. Many times we see Montag just moving around with the camera following him, which allows us to concentrate on his character and which lends Montag's character certain integrity. Nicholas Roeg's cinematography is good-looking. The ending of the film is very beautiful and as a whole, one may be willing to overlook some weaknesses and enjoy the film. Finally, a special mention should be given to Bernard Herrmann's score which is one of the most beautiful and haunting ever written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut Abandons "New Wave" To Do Standard Hollywood Trash !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never read Bradbury's novel &amp; don't intend to do so, so this review is strictly based upon my viewing of the film Fahrenheit 451.This film is SO-O-O-O BAD that I had to stop watching 1/2 way through, so my review is based only on the 1st 1/2 of the film.I only watched this film because I decided to find out what the French "New Wave" cinema was all about &amp; I'm in the process of watching all of Truffaut's directorial efforts starting with his 1st film, 400 Blows. This film is Truffaut's 5th effort as sole director of a feature film &amp; it is such a disappointing departure from his previous films. The "New Wave" was supposed to be a cinematic rebellion against the staged, stiff, &amp; formulaic French films of the 1940's &amp; 1950's. Truffaut did a pretty good job at rebelling in his 1st 4 films but this one is little more than a formulaic canned Hollywood style sci-fi film. None of the creativity &amp; freshness so evident in his previous efforts is evident here. In short, in Fahrenheit 451, Truffaut sells out to the Cinematic Establishment that he railed against as a film critic in the 1950's &amp; that he rebelled against in his 1st 4 productions.The cinematography in this film is just poor compared to Truffaut's earlier films. No long shots. No shots of the mundane, trivial details that were so interesting in earlier films. No extended shots of faces. The shooting of this entire film includes a large, very dark halo around the entire screen with only a small bright opening in the center of the screen. What's That About? This is obviously a very LOW LOW budget film because for a futuristic sci-fi movie the props were VERY VERY low tech. Montag's boss had conventional, made for paper file cabinets in his office. The phones all had rotary dials, even though digital push button phones were available in 1966. The telephone handsets were right out out of the 1920's. The fire trucks were not only low tech, but their construction was just crude &amp; amateurish. The work suits of the firemen were likewise crude &amp; their headgear looked like those worn by WWI fighter pilots. The appliances in Montag's house were all 1960's vintage, except for the large TV screen on the wall. The houses &amp; apartments were not futuristic at all. The monorail was the only prop that was remotely futuristic looking. The hat that Montag wore off duty looked like a German worker's hat from the 1930's. This film did the POOREST job I've ever scene of creating a futuristic world in a film that is supposed to be about a futuristic society.The casting was horrible. Seems like every actor had a different foreign accent. Casting Julie Christie in 2 separate roles in the same film is just a hare brained idea that didn't work. The only other time that I've ever seen the same actor cast in 2 different roles in the same film was an Italian movie where the same actor played both identical twin brothers &amp; that was an appropriate use of an actor in twin roles in the same film. I saw Oskar Werner in Truffaut's Jim And Jules, &amp; he was great in that film because he was cast appropriately. In this film, Werner was just lousy as Montag &amp; gave the character no depth whatsoever.The whole idea of the futuristic society in this film spending so much time &amp; effort at burning books is just STUPID. Montag tells his boss that he's been a fireman (book burner) for 6 years &amp; there is a scene where new recruits are being trained to be firemen &amp; Montag's boss is telling him about expanding operations by hiring even more firemen &amp; there are scenes of firemen looking for books EVERYWHERE (including a baby carriage). My Question Is - Where The Hell Are All These Books Coming From?? With all the man power &amp; technology that has been apparently been put into burning all the books over the number of years envisaged in this film, surely all the books would've been destroyed long before this film even started. Presumably, the printing presses have already all been shut down, so the remaining task would only entail burning all the books that existed before the printing presses stopped producing new books. But the extended, ongoing effort portrayed in this film to destroy books seems to assume that number of already existing books out there is never ending, which is just ridiculous &amp; contrary to common sense. After you stop the printing presses, the destruction of all the remaining books in a society would be a very short term proposition, if done intensively &amp; not entail the never ending effort envisaged in this phony movie. If you really wanted to eradicate all the books in a society, then you'd simply do a door to door search of every house &amp; building &amp; Voila !!, it's just done &amp; over with.I will continue plowing through Truffaut's directorial efforts but after Fahrenheit 451 I'm just not expecting things to get better. Like other directors (such as John Sayles) who started their careers determined to make "different" &amp; "better" films, it looks like Truffaut sold out his artistic &amp; creative values for the Almighty Buck &amp; that's just a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shameful Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film after I finished reading the thrilling novel, but in fact after 20 minutes of the movie I was already bored and appalled at how Truffaut tried to translate the book into a movie.If you've ever read the book, Farenheit 451, there is one key component that stands out, the mechanical hound. In the film, the mechanical hound is never seen, it is not even mentioned.There is also a looming shadow of war that the country is facing in the book, that is also left out and it ruins the ending of the movie because the war plays a critical part in the overall story and inevitably the ending.Then we have the characters, Montag, Clarisse, Linda, and the captain. For starters, Montag is supposed to be a fireman (his job is to burn the books that he and the others find in the homes of citizens) so he is supposed to have no unique traits. He is portrayed in the book as a conformed, inconspicuous man with no feeling until the plot permits him to. But in the movie he stands out from the others and has an Austrian accent that clearly distinguishes him from the other firemen. Clarisse is supposed to be a teenage girl who dies very early on in the book, but in the movie she lives on as a twenty-some woman who doesn't show as much livelihood as her novel counterpart. Linda is the same in most respects but just really doesn't do it for me. The fact that the same actress plays both Clarisse and Linda is too much for me.As for the rest direction, it just flat out fails in almost every respect. The whole film just feels anticlimactic and put me to sleep, I finished the movie with an empty, disappointed feeling. I feel that if an adaptation had been made under the direction of Franklin Schaffner or Stanley Kubrick then it could've had a lot more potential. In Kubrick's respects not just because he is an outstanding director but because of his medium to medium adaptations like "A Clockwork Orange". Maybe the film industry just wasn't ready to tackle such a tremendous masterpiece such as Fahrenheit 451 yet. But now that we're getting a reboot of the movie in the next year or so, we might have better luck.I would like to note though that this is just my personal opinion of the movie and if you are reading this then it might be a good idea to see it for yourself, who knows you might actually have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 451; or, How Roeg saved Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before any discussion of this film, there must be a line drawn between the politics of the film versus the way this film was created. Being a Truffaut fan, I didn't want to miss his idiosyncrasies within a scene merely because the politics of book burning were overwhelming. Yes, one understands that this is a film adaptation of "Fahrenheit 451", a beloved classic that gives booksellers inspiration every time it is read, but also this is a Truffaut film. Several reviews state that Truffaut did an excellent job with the direction, and then spend four paragraphs discussing our society and its apathetic ways toward literature. In this discussion of this film, there will be a solid line between Truffaut's direction and Bradbury's themes. Was one stronger than the other? Did Truffaut's adaptation muddy Bradbury's final thoughts? While you may agree or disagree with my discoveries, one needs to realize that this was a film watched, not a book read. Did Truffaut satisfy the main discourses of film enjoyment? Was it entertaining? Did it spark debate? Did it decorate strong characters? For this reviewer, Truffaut's "Fahrenheit 451" was a mixed bag of cinematic delight. The characters, albeit well fit within the realm of Bradbury, just felt mediocre. Their direction seemed wooden, while the camera focus seemed misplaced for a majority of the film. Again, like most Truffaut, it was colorful, but he just didn't seem himself until the final act ? where Bradbury's ideas and Truffaut's direction finally congealed together. "Fahrenheit 451" was an adaption, but not one that stands among the infamous.Our troubles begin in this film with our lead, Guy Montag (played by "Jules and Jim" lead, Oskar Werner), who obviously hated working for Truffaut and this project. Despite the rumor that the two clashed at every opportunity, Werner gave one of the worst performances seen for a long time. When Truffaut couldn't get Terrance Stamp for his first choice, the lackluster Werner stepped in, and the downfall of this film began. Werner gave nothing for audiences to attach themselves to. There was no emotion, no big moment of empathy, no excitement. Werner went from one scene to the next, allowing his sleepy eyes to provide us with just enough to cope with the hour and a half running time. He was horrible as a "Fireman", and even less convincing as a man with a sudden passion for the written word. There were moments when laughter was more suitable than viable emotion. This is supposed to be a tense film, a confusing film, a film where the emotion surrounding books becomes a greater asset than the material objects that Montag possessed. Alas, this wasn't the case. With the supposed anger surrounding our lead and director, only the lessons of Styrofoam and cardboard were used. Thankfully, there was Julie Christie mixed within the story to heighten the side bits. Feeling a bit Brunel-ian, Christie was used as two characters in this film, providing an opportunity for Truffaut to demonstrate a particular emotion with books and without them. While Christie wasn't Oscar-worthy, she did allow for an appealing appetizer to the dismal main course (Werner). She and Cyril Cusack (The Captain), anointed with the task of keeping the film together, managed to save this film from utter disappointment to sheer mediocrity.What makes "Fahrenheit 451" an interesting film to self-explode, is not only the odd direction by Truffaut, but the powerful camera work by one Nicolas Roeg (the man who later gave us "The Man Who Fell To Earth"). All of the colors, the shots as they were filmed, and the choices of camera placement were, possibly, the second only greatest moment of this film. I credit Roeg for giving us the unsettling feel of this film. The contrast from the bold colors of red in the community with the bland colors of inside Montag's home (and elsewhere) forced the setting upon us in a good way. As Truffaut and Werner were arguing with each other, Roeg was creating a film ? and it is obvious as the visuals of this film looked creative, but everything else came nowhere close.Finally, without giving away the ending, one has to admit that the ending to this film was Truffaut finally finding his way again. Suddenly, when Montag found his real "home", it became obvious that Truffaut found his comfort zone. He understood this film, and the ending wrapped up brilliantly. The direction, the voice, the visuals ? they all seemed to come together in a way that shocked even myself. If only the rest of the film had been this way ? what a surprising film this would have been.Overall, I believe this film, if done correctly, could be the first science fiction film ever to win an Oscar for best film. The themes are universal and the looming future is closer than we think. Yet, Truffaut could not handle this. He and Werner's arguing created a difficult mess of mixed emotions and sub-par casting. Roeg's scenes were brilliant, but couldn't save this sinking ship. "Fahrenheit 451" had potential, but failed on nearly every level. If you choose to view this film, check out the final scene in which Truffaut finally understands Bradbury's work. Why did it take so long to discover the true meaning of the written page? Urg.Grade: ** out of ***** (two stars for Roeg and Christie ONLY)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, I don't think this is a bad movie. Although Fahrenheit 451 movie itself is an adaptation of Ray Bradbury's book. The movie is very cinematic.A man in the house picked up the phone and then followed with a sequence of fireman's daily work. It is a very good establishment at the beginning of the story. Instead of telling you a story, it showed you how cruel and cool those guys are and the intensity of the emotion.I love the whole setting and the real meaning of the movie. I can see the props, the set and costumes play very important role to enhance the surreal-world. The plasma TV is really great design in 1966! Oskar Werner's acting made the role-Montag more convincing (much better than Jules in Jules et Jim). This movie can surely enter my Top 10. And of course Truffaut is a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie, fantastic book! (contains a tiny spoiler that nobody usually gets anyway)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who actually believes we live in a free society; where we are not guided by advertising and controlled to form opinions that really are not our own, do not watch this film or read this book. You will not like it, and you will not get it. You believe that you make your own decisions, and you will balk at the idea that the government really does decide what is "good" and what is "bad". (Churches are good so they do not pay taxes, but homeless people are lazy so they do not get healthcare) This film is full of symbols. It is not about burning books, it is about the suppression of ideas. You cannot take this book or film literally. I have read earlier posts that have tried and the posts showed that they did not grasp the concept. Or, they disagree with it and try to discredit the film because of their beliefs. These things are real. They happen everyday. (The Tin Drum case in Oklahoma, and the thousands of books/films this country has banned and continues to ban every year.) Few people even notice that the credits are spoken, not written. That alone skyrockets this film as one of the best adaptations of a book ever. Truffaut understood what Bradbury was trying to say.  The film was made 35 years ago and looks it. The book is 50 years old but predicts much of what we see today. TV controls the masses. We believe what we are told. Ask any high school senior to find Uganda on a map. They probably cannot but it is a good bet that they know all the words to the latest Britney Spears song. Open you mind, look at this film and begin to question what you see around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does celluloid melt at Fahrenheit 451? (It's hot!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest films in a long time. Stars Oscar Werner as Montag, a futuristic fireman whose job it is to burn all books, since they are forbidden. In the midst of it all, he meets a cheerful school teacher named Clarisse (Julie Christie), who looks a great deal like his wife Linda (also Julie Christie)and challenges him to actually read the books he burns! Julie Christie gives a stunning double-performance (very convincing) as two very opposite characters -- Linda, who spends her entire life with "the family on the wall" (television), and Clarisse, who struggles to bring the art of literature back to mainstream society. Her acting is comparable to that of Peter Sellers in the Stanley Kubrick Classic, Dr. Stangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is into one of those "bleak future with a ray of light" movies. It has interesting (though not amazing) special effects, like the ability to go up a fire pole. This is certainly Francois Truffaut's greatest directorial achievement. A perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad the book was better. In a strange way, if the movie was better than the book, I wouldn't have liked the movie as much as I did. The book (and the film) is about the importance of reading. You should read the book before seeing the movie , because first of all it's better, and second of all it's kind of what the story is about. Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is a "fireman" in a totalitarian future. His job is to destroy books, which have now been banned because of their contrasting opinions. He lives with his wife Linda Montag (Julie Christie) who spends all her time inside watching TV. All is good and bland, until one day Montag meets a freethinking school teacher Clarisse McClellan (Christie) whose free spirit and individuality causes him to question the book-less society. Soon Montag starts taking books and he eventually becomes devoted to saving them. The movie is good, but it's kind of weird. I didn't really get a very surreal feel from the book but in the movie it works all right. It also takes creative liberties from the book. But overall, it's a pretty good adaptation. If you've read the book, this is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the essential essence of Bradbury's classic SF novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just viewed the Blu-Ray version of "Fahrenheit 451" last night, and by coincidence, I just finished with the audiobook version read by Bradbury himself a few weeks ago. My initial impression is that Truffaut did his best to do what Bradbury most certainly accomplished; to instill a love and enduring respect for the written word, and by natural extension, ideas and thoughts that you, the reader, may not be too comfortable with, but realize must stand for thought to remain free.That being said, substantial cuts had to be made. Fabre, the old craven professor and Montag's "silent partner" from the book is gone, as is the sinister and ruthless Mechanical Hound. Clarisse, killed off early in the novel, lives right up until the end, and the apocalyptic war which is the climax of the novel is dispensed with. The most glaring shortfall, perhaps, is in the manhunt for Montag; a pulse-pounding, suspenseful fifth of the novel, it is here shrunk down to approximately three minutes of screen time, if that. Even more regrettable, Truffaut resorts to some cheesy green-screen effects of flying policeman to try to cough up a tiny bit of that excitement.But give Truffaut his due. He had the good sense to hire Herrmann for the soundtrack, which, IMHO, is probably one of the Maestro's best; he had just gotten fired from Hitchcock for his dissonant and rejected score for "Torn Curtain," and no doubt Herrmann wanted to prove to the world he still had the goods. Sumptuous and international in flavor, Herrmann delivers brilliance which really helps the visuals come alive.Truffaut's visual sense, OTOH, is economical, but effective, particularly in the scene where Clarisse's aunt defiantly dies with her precious pile of books when the firemen come calling. His presentation of the ubiquitous and mind-controlling tele-screen is scaled down from Bradbury's description, but eerily prescient, looking just like the flat screen TVs we are now using in 2016.In the Blu-Ray version, saturated colors leap off the screen in the outdoor sequences, and are muted for interiors. The extra definition is especially appreciated for the book burning scenes; you can read the text right off the page, and you may even spy a MAD paperback with Alfred E. Neumann's infamous face if you keep a sharp eye out.Bottom line: the book is much better and a more powerful experience, but watching Truffaut's version of "Fahrenheit 451" today, you may feel a wee bit uncomfortable that Bradbury's warning has not been sufficiently heeded. When is the last time YOU have read a book cover to cover, particularly of an author's ideas you don't particularly agree with?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a lot of exposition, especially with the monorail going back and forth, which showed the sheer monotony of the kind of lives the people were living, and could have been cut back.The movie never showed WHY Montag started reading the books that he burned. Was it just the curiosity that Clarisse started in him, or was he already dissatisfied with his life, and was looking for a way out of it? What was up with all of the oranges in the movie? On the breakfast table and in the break room at the firehouse? Plus the orange juice dispenser? I mean I like orange juice, but not THAT often? I don't recall a lot of meat being served in the movie. Was everyone a vegetarian? And just what was Fabian's deal? Was he jealous of Montag's promotion? Of Montag himself? Or was he simply an opportunistic jerk? Oskar I think, was hampered by the stilted dialogue, along with his really BAD relationship with Truffaut, and came across as a bit of a zombie in his relationship with his wife Linda; only really coming to life with Clarisse.I highly recommend the movie, but it does have its bad spots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of COURSE the book was better; filmmaking is a collaborative process and things can go horribly wrong at any stage of the game. In this case, the biggest mistake Truffaut made- in my opinion- was in casting Oskar Werner as Montag: his transition from heartless by-the-book fireman to voracious reader seems more than a bit sudden. WHAT, exactly, triggers his change of heart? There are some nice little touches throughout, however: when he sits down to look at the funnies, for instance, none of the panels have word balloons- and the EMS workers come across as little more than auto mechanics making a house call when Montag's wife overdoses. And, as has been postulated since THE TWONKY, television has become The Great Pacifier. It was interesting to see Cyril Cusack as the Fire Chief: he also played the shop proprietor who turns in Winston Smith (John Hurt) in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR (the 1984 version). "We've all got to be alike," he tells Montag: "The only way to be happy is for everyone to be made equal." By THAT, of course, he means IGNORANT. (Recent figures suggest that fully 40% of Americans are illiterate. That means that their reading and reading comprehension is on a Fourth Grade Level. "The real threat," Ray Bradbury says, "is ignorance." Won't be long, now...) Truffaut, a Hitchcock historian, also employs Bernard Herrmann as the composer for FAHRENHEIT 451. Not a bad move. Nor was it a bad move to have Nicolas Roeg (THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, DON'T LOOK NOW) handle the cinematography. Now that we're living in The Disinformation Age, it behooves us all to heed the warnings in movies like FAHRENHEIT 451.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the 1951 Ray Bradbury novel, Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is a part of a book burning squad in the future. The world is a cold heartless place where the totalitarian government has banned all books. His wife Linda (Julie Christie) as well as the rest of society has been drugged and watching TV constantly. He falls for his lively neighbor Clarisse (Julie Christie) who turns out to be a book reader and he reads books that he confiscates.It's certainly an interesting piece of art. However I'm not sure it's a great movie. There is a cold sterilized feel to the movie. The style is definitely dated. It's a sci-fi more in keeping with the earlier era with a human touch delivered by great french filmmaker François Truffaut. He gives the somewhat flawed but fascinating source material an European touch. The dystopia world should be a lot more scarier but Truffaut is set on making the audience think. The poetic ending is fascinating but still flawed. Nevertheless, it is a very cool idea.</fullReview>

It was a miscalculation to cast Julie Christie in dual roles. The special effect of a flying police patrol is laughably amateurish. The lame epilogue, allowing us to wander among idealists who have volunteered to keep books alive by memorizing them, has no dramatic impact whatsoever. A remake has been rumored for years, but who knows what the Bradbury estate might have to say about it? The first attempt fell woefully flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One For The Books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are reading this, inhabiting as you are a time point somewhere forward of mine, then perhaps there is still hope...It's the future, and all is bleak. People seem to drift along in narcoleptic shells, while a woman on television urges all to "Be tolerant today." That is unless someone is caught with a book. Then its time to call in the firemen, who burn books in public demonstrations. Life is good for one fireman, Montag (Oskar Werner), en route to promotion until he starts to think a little and wonder if something is not quite right.As an adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel of the same name, "Fahrenheit 451" covers well-known ground in a thoroughly unique way. Director François Truffaut, in his only English-language film, creates a drab reality that draws you in with an luminous, inert apathy, aided by sterling color visuals by Nicolas Roag and a killer score of engaging dissonance by Bernard Herrmann.Right away, the film plays with your expectations by denying you the usual visual credits. They are read to you instead, in a clipped voice, over a succession of zoom shots of television aerials. This approach never lets up. As a story, "Fahrenheit 451" has more than its share of holes, but the tone is perfectly set and developed, pushing this astringency to what are sometimes harrowing, often playfully absurd limits."She's rather like you, except her hair is long," Montag tells a woman on a monorail who asks about his wife. It proves rather true, as both woman and wife are played by the same actress (Julie Christie). Otherwise, they couldn't be more different. The woman, Clarisse, asks impertinent questions and shows signs of rebellion. Wife Linda is a thorough conformist, happily chirping single-word lines to a television set as fey actors engage in a hilariously banal discussion about placing guests at a table.Some reviewers call this confusing, but it's set up right away as a kind of joke about conformity and ensuing loss of identity. Knowing what I do of Christie, it's surprising to hear her say in a DVD commentary that she preferred playing the wife. Yet she really nails this insipid character for all her goofiness and hints of depth.In some ways, the movie soft-soaps the nature of the regime. We don't see them kill anyone (only the rebels do that), and they seem entirely too vacant to manage the sort of effective countermeasures we associate with totalitarian regimes. When a criminal is on the run, people are simply directed to stand outside their front door and "look and listen," to no effect. It's no wonder the rebellion seems to operate so well under their noses.Werner is great in his central role, a potato-faced prole who can't even remember how many years he has served as a fireman (mushmindedness seems a chronic problem in this shut-down world.) Werner had big problems with Truffaut, and this may have affected his work, but it's almost a happy accident given how his morose countenance complements the odd visuals and stark angles from which we view his story.I watched "Fahrenheit 451" the first time in a classroom, and was put off by its stark, institutional quality. These days, as an adult, I find the same quality draws me in. It's strikingly fearless that way, and builds to a wonderful payoff by film's end, when we see an alternate reality, more hopeful but also strange, at work. Herrmann's score really rises to the occasion, and it's hard not to get a little misty as various characters pop into the frame introducing themselves.Not a classic, but a definite pleasure to watch in its singular way, very much of the times but timeless in its message and its cold, austere beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Truffaut's only film in English and his first colour film. Here he choose to go in a different direction than his previous films, abandoning the "French new wave" style, and moving more towards Hitchcock. Even though the film is more like a SF-Drama, it has some undertones of a thriller. Some scenes seem to be very inspired by Hitchcock. The opening for example. And man, did I love that opening. I think that after the first 10min I said to myself, boy this is some great film. There is one shot in particular that I liked, a zoom jump- cut. Excellent. And so it goes all the way throughout. Very well shot, with some vivid red colours. Somewhere later in the movie we have a shot of bunch of books burning. From Jane Eyre to philosophical novels, all of them slowly catching on fire, burning paper by paper. That was so magically shot, that you have to see it to enjoy it. Not to give all the credit to the director, Oskar Werner and Julie Christie have done some fine job too, even though some people didn't like it because they may have seemed a bit wooden. But that was the point actually.The plot itself is very interesting. If you've read the book you'll know. But for those who haven;t, like me, here it goes: In a near future the government decides that reading books is dangerous. So decides to burn them all. Yup, book reading is against the law. You should see what has become of society. People are very cold, you would say that they have no emotions anymore. Their intelligence has dropped, and all day long they just sit in front of the TV watching some super-silly programs. Not to give away the rest of the plot, this should be enough to intrigue you to go and see it for yourself. Anyway a very good film, I rate it around 7-8/10, it does give you some thoughts to think about. Go and see it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly Beautiful and Lyrical Film About an Ugly World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Futuristic dystopias must be among the hardest things to write convincingly. There is really no precedent to follow, and for the reader or viewer who looks for holes in the plot, there are usually plenty to be had. But since these works are more about the message and the theme than the actual plot, one must simply go with it or abandon the genre entirely.Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 tells a bare bones story of a world almost as grim as Orwell's Oceania but without the grittiness. In fact, Bradbury goes completely in the opposite direction to Orwell and presents us with a world so sanitized that it is almost sterile, and artificial in the extreme. Fascinatingly, Bradbury's writing is particularly prescient here: he gives us huge flat screen TVs that take up entire walls, phones that fit snugly in the ear, and the first automatic teller machine in recorded fiction. And it's remarkable how much of it he got right.Francois Truffaut chose Bradbury's work as his first film in English. At first glance it seems an odd choice, because it is so different from the mostly realistic films he had made previously. But he chose to bring this very strange world to life, and the results may not be perfect, but they're spellbinding.Truffaut made a few changes, of course. The novel has no real sense of place, though to me "the City" it referred to made me think of New York, but this could be simply because I am a New Yorker. Revisiting the book recently, it occurred to me that "the City" might actually have been a reference to Chicago; Bradbury's Illinois roots would appear to bolster this idea. Truffaut's film is clearly set somewhere in England, with an odd evocation of a futuristic London suburb.The oddest, and ultimately the most interesting, thing about this film is its cast. Guy Montag, the fireman who starts out as a burner of illegal books (note: in this world all books are illegal) and gradually comes to realize the horrid profession in which he has been laboring, is played by Austrian actor Oskar Werner, who makes no attempt to hide his accent and who allegedly feuded bitterly with Truffaut over his characterization, even going so far as to get his hair cut severely short before the filming of the last scene (if memory serves the movie was filmed in sequence). I don't know if this is true; I read it somewhere. All I can say is that whatever their troubles, it does not show in the finished product.The second oddly brilliant piece of casting is that of Julie Christie in a dual role as Montag's wife Linda (name changed from Mildred in the novel), a woman who embraces every shallow aspect of the society in which she lives, and Clarisse McClellan, the next door neighbor with whom Guy forms a tentative friendship before she is taken away by the State as an undesirable. In the book Montag's wife was a woman of thirty, while Clarisse was a seventeen-year-old girl. Truffaut's solution was to advance Clarisse's age a bit and make her a schoolteacher instead of a student. The character of Linda was left alone, and Julie Christie was at that ageless age where the two women could have been twins or fifteen years apart in age and either way it would have worked.In many ways, despite Montag's centrality to the story, it is Christie who provides the emotional thrust of this film, playing with great authority two completely different women, both of whom are in one way or another important to Montag.I won't give away anything more except to say that the ending is different as well, less apocalyptic and more the sort of visionary lyricism that Truffaut did so well.I see that a remake is "in production." I wish they wouldn't. Bradbury himself, regarding this film, said that Truffaut had captured the heart and soul of the novel and he was very grateful. There is no need to remake that which has already been done well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak look at an unknown future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of science fiction, I was quite looking forward to seeing this film. As dated as it may have become, it is still worth a watch. For viewers born in the last 25 years, however, this version of the film will seem tedious. Fear not, however, because a remake is on the way!The plot itself plunges the viewer into an unknown future where the written word is banned. Guy Montag has the task of burning books, in order to protect people from the evils contained within. Before too long, however, Guy begins to question himself and the rules he helps to enforce upon a somewhat bland and culture-less society. The director, François Truffaut, made a very brave choice, firstly by directing a movie in a language he was for the most part unfamiliar with, but also for casting Julie Christie in two roles. I didn't think this was necessary, especially given that Christie seemed unconvincing in both roles.I'd like to make a suggestion for who I think should play the role of Guy Montag, who was played by an intriguing Austrian, Oskar Werner. The host of suggestions made on the message boards have been many and varied, but my choice is absolutely perfect for the role on multiple levels. Sebastian Koch (The Lives of Others) is absolutely perfect for this. He's German, is a somewhat morose actor not dissimilar to Oskar Werner, and for me, is the perfect reincarnation of Guy Montag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Flaws Don't Seriously Mar A Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember reading some of Ray Bradbury's stories in high school, but as far as I recall I missed Fahrenheit 451, so this movie was relatively unknown to me. Based on the Bradbury story, the movie depicts a futuristic society in which books (and therefore real knowledge) are banned, and - if found - burned, sometimes along with the homes they're found in. The result is a society of mindless, thoughtless drones, although, in all honesty, they're portrayed as content enough in their situation (I think here of Linda, played by Julie Christie.) I was disappointed in the sets. They had a very low-budget feel to them, and the futuristic society seemed anything but, to be honest. The "telephones" they used looked like wall mounted telephones from the 1930's, and I found it interesting that a supposedly futuristic movie never alludes (explicitly or implicitly) to computers. I know anyone can get the future wrong, but a future full of computers was pretty standard fare when this movie was made.The performances were not bad. Oskar Werner did a fine job as Montag, the fireman who, in the course of his job of burning books develops a love for them, and Christie was quite believable in a double role as both Linda (Montag's wife) and Clarisse, the woman Montag meets who turns him on to books. There's pretty good use of irony. I think especially of the fact that firemen in this futuristic world set fires rather than putting them out (as was mentioned in the movie). The point is well made that living day after day in such a bland world can become addictive, especially when Linda turns Montag in, because her aimless, thoughtless, meaningless and mindless life is threatened by his interest in books. For most of the way through this is a pretty bleak movie, portraying a bleak society, which makes the ending more powerful.Montag finds out about a society of book lovers who memorize books before destroying them so that no one can take them away, and he runs off to join them. The people in the society have no names, except the book that they've memorized. Montag is to become Edgar Allen Poe's "Tales Of Mystery And Madness," if I remember correctly. That in itself says something about this future. Even the heroes have to give up their personal identities in order to become that which they're trying to save (namely knowledge through books) - and yet that same knowledge is the very thing that helps individuals be individuals. The ending is both hopeful (someone is trying to save this knowledge) and yet strangely depressing as we see people wandering almost in a trance-like state, reciting the books that they've become over and over again.The movie is not without its weaknesses, certainly, but the story is pretty good, and as I watched Linda and her friends watching the mindless drivel that was broadcast on what seemed to pass for television in that world I found myself reflecting on the increasingly mindless drivel we see on television in our own world, and wondering what might become of us! 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut Struggles with Ambitious Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I teach high school English. Fahrenheit 451 is a staple of the curriculum in my school. My strong sense is the talented Truffaut felt overwhelmed by the sci-fi genre in general. F451 is a soft, science-fiction narrative and Truffaut takes out some of the more challenging symbols and characterizations (where is the mechanical hound?). He seems weighed down by the futuristic vision and the film loses a lot of its impact for true sci-fi buffs. My feeling is you need to partner the "message" of the piece with a spot on art direction and set design. (it truly looks like an old episode of "Get Smart").Look to "A Clockwork Orange" to get a futuristic vision "right" without the help of the advanced technology of today.Oscar Werner's take on Montag is difficult too. He is a curious actor with a strange moody quality. While he gets gives the character a strange flatness that sort of works, he doesn't hint at the inner passion of Montag. Truffaut and Werner's relationship dissolved during the filming, as Truffaut claimed Werner had gone "cold" as an actor. Again, Werner's take just doesn't feel authentic. You'd think the strain of his relationship with the director would fuel his performance-it doesn't. Julie Christie is fine in a duel performance. Truffaut gets the ending right. But overall, the movie is a strange mishmash. It feels like a school play gone wrong. Here's looking to the new film version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future is supposed to be simple, right? In "Fahrenheit 451" This future is twisted! Books outlawed? What is this? Ray Bradbury takes his best novel and puts it on the big screen. And they say its a bomb? What's with these critics? But Bradbury is a defender. You go Ray! His book displays on how the future thinks of literature, and the way the society thinks of it. Guy Montag is a fireman and his job is burning books at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence the name. However, since he started to read one of Charles Dickens novel, things get a little brighter for him and his love-life for his wife gets bleaker. When he meets a former teacher named Clarisse, she opens him up and gives him the choice of the life he's living. Even though Montag ended up an outcast, to me it was worth it. My favorite book to recite is Robert Lois Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde". To me I would keep the book if I were you, it'll be worth your while. This movie is just for fun, and all you sci-fi fans, learn it! Make Ray Bradbury proud! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

For the younger viewers who may have not heard of this movie, or the players , the book which I did not read, should have been on the "A" list, like Animal Farm and 1984 .

		<shortDescription>Awful acting, poor directing and cinematography are the least of the worries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations of the 1966 film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's fine novel of the same name. However, this film was a huge letdown. From the very first scene I had an extremely hard time believing that this was in fact the dystopian world so adeptly described in the novel; the firemen's 'red toy truck' fire-engine which Beatty, Montag, and the rest of the agents of destruction are propelled on to the domiciles of bibliophiles is so phony-looking, and unmenacing, 'the picture doesn't fit the words', so to speak. Along with the 1950's siren on the rudimentary looking firetruck that has to be manually shut off by Beatty (remember, this is supposed to be futuristic), the uniforms that the firemen wear, black with odd-looking leather accents on the helmets/caps, are something out of an S&amp;M fantasy and would look more complete if their wearers were toting long whips as they march purposefully to dole out their punishment. The props and uniforms are not the only things that seem out of place, unfortunately, as the directing is awful.For example, at the first house that the firemen pay a visit to, they clumsily toss books on a wire table for the purpose of burning them, half of them falling off the grill just as quickly as they were being tossed- and the film actually cuts back to this act of inefficiency more than once! These firemen are supposed to be the picture of competence and efficiency, as they are described in the novel.The interactions between characters is embarrassing. The script of the movie deviates too far away from the original text, and the writer does a poor job in choosing suitable dialogue in its place. From the the outset, the chemistry that is supposed to be palpable between Montag and Clarisse falls flat, and this is in part due to the uninspiring first discussion that they have on an inverted subway train. In the novel, this encounter occurs on a dark street corner, alone, and with a more direct, visceral question-and-answer type exchange.Unfortunately, the aforementioned mistakes snowball throughout the rest of the movie with very few, if any, redeeming qualities. The spirit of the original text is long gone before the 10 minute mark, and you wonder why you wasted nearly 2 hours of your life watching something so miserable. Seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many. Francois Truffaut's film adaptation is a big failure for all the above reasons, especially considering he had the captivating novel by Ray Bradbury as his starting point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessentially English courage under fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will always stand alone, notwithstanding the conceited plans for a remake, as a classic science-fiction vignette. It is based on a small story by Ray Bradbury about a society where books are banned and public service officials called, errr 'firemen', enforce their destruction.What gives this movie its special atmosphere is the smallness of the story. There is no "science" gimmickry except the crudest sort, such as big-screen TVs, which are no longer fiction anyway. There is no character development apart from the disillusioning of the "fireman" Montag (Oskar Werner), and his betrayal by his airhead wife (Julie Christie). There is not even a "location". Things just happen in and around a few houses, there is a monorail train that people commute on but which just delivers them down a ramp into desolate country, and there is the fire house which is just a garage front painted red.Red paint was probably a major item on the props bill for the movie since plenty of it was used to doll up a kinky flat-bed vehicle as the Fire Engine, and the only other road vehicle we see, apparently a Jaguar Mk. 2 saloon carrying a public address loudspeaker.Everything about this production has the feel of the small-budget TV-format plays common in Britain in the 1960s. The acting is amateur and looks unrehearsed. The snow scenes near the end of the film are almost certainly simply due to chance English weather during shooting rather than being intended. So how can this film be such a classic "gem"?My answer is that while showing us the book-burning goons on their raids, the camera continually reminds us of immortal literature titles and authors. You are almost bound to have read and know some of these books, and seeing the folly of those who would destroy them for everybody is likely to raise a gut protest in you as it did in me. This is actually more important than the ostensible "message" of Bradbury's story, which could be taken as merely a satire on censorship. What matters is that the readiness of anyone to sacrifice themselves rather than join the book burners, which idea is introduced in an unconvincing suicide-by-immolation, by the end of the film you will see as being essential.My reviewer friends, look not in this movie for the grand historical context, rights of man, Orwellian political statement or references to totalitarian repression. Though these can all be found, none is done with any depth. Look not for technology because what you see could mostly be from the 1940s (if not the big TV screen), and the jet-powered firemen that are briefly shown are too silly for words. Look not to Julie Christie for the lovely close-up you could expect because she is overqualified here for the air headed pill-popping bimbo part she plays, including the most moronic audience-participation TV show imaginable. (Julie Christie also plays another part with a short butch-cut hairstyle. This sort of thing makes me feel that our string is being pulled.)Look not for a very coherent "future" society because what you see is more credible as an alternative PAST, a bit of post-war suburban England somehow overrun by totalitarianism - I even toyed for a while with the thought that the whole setting was some kind of secret mass psychology project.Look instead to be touched by the quiet bravery of the quintessentially English characters who make a stand to protect their (our) heritage: books. Anyone who dismisses this movie because "it doesn't have digital effects" or "libraries can be put on CDs" may be awfully modern but in my opinion misses out on a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those unforgettable movies which improves with each viewing, 451 is a treat for both the eyes and the ears. Thanks to Universal's recent restoration of Truffaut's first colour movie, we are treated to possibly Bernard Hermann's finest musical score. Quite unlike any other movie of the mid-1960s in it's 'look', 451 features beautiful Julie Christie in a dual role. The ideas in 451, the dehumanisation of a society which has banned the printed word, where firemen start fires rather than putting them out, apparently weren't well received a the the time of original release.Even today this movie probably won't appeal to the average movie-goer. With spoken credits and no onscreen text apart from 'The End', it's at times startling viewing. Based on a Ray Bradbury short story with minimal alterations, the author was obviously pleased with the final cut as, judging by the accompanying dvd interview, it holds a special place in his heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>François Truffant's Fahrenheit 451 was created before the year 1970, so you know it's bound to be remade. In fact, Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Majestic) is recreating it for next year. The 1966 version, however, will overpower the remake. It even was better than the book, which is quite a feat.Oskar Werner is the perfect person to play Guy Montag (actually, we never hear his first name in this version, it's always `Montag'), a fireman in the near future. His job isn't to put out fires; it's to start them. In this crazy future-world, books are for the burning, and the title temperature is at which they burn. He thinks he's happy: he lives in a nice house with wife Linda (Julie Christie) who is dying to get another TV for the wall. However, once he meets Clarisse (also Christie), who puts things into perspective. Montag then realizes what he must do, and how he is in danger.I think what really made this better than the book was the visuals. It was hard to imagine what the world looked like in Ray Bradbury's novel, and here it was so lavishly done, it looked like something fake that was made to look real. The colors all stood out, especially the common bright red. It looked so fictional that I could actually believe that it was true. The set was done so creatively that it looked real. And, like the book, Bradbury got most of everything right on target.Werner is a great actor, but who really stands out here is Christie. Being able to tackle two entirely different roles is more impressive than Peter Sellers' three in Dr. Strangelove. Why, you ask? Because this role wasn't comedic. It required two different viewpoints, two ways of acting. I congratulate her.In fact, all of Truffant's crew deserves a round of applause. Not only does he have a flair for directing (it was his first color film, and his only in English), but he also has good ideas for colleagues. Famous Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann composed the wonderful score for Fahrenheit 451. Perhaps the greatest crew member was Nicolas Hoag, the cinematographer. Giving us many great close up shots of burning books, which were simply amazing, I'm surprised he isn't more famous.Basically, if you've read the book, you won't be under whelmed. Truffant's great adaptation of the screenplay, along with Jean-Louis Richard, is the best type of novel adaptation. It's not sticking incredibly close to the source material (The Green Mile, for instance), and doesn't stray too far from it (The Shining). It's the perfect medium. Overall, Fahrenheit 451 is a very good adaptation of a good book, and should be seen by those who have read the book.My rating: 8/10Not Rated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truffaut's first English language film is a fascinating vision of a future distopia. The well known source is Bradbury's story where bookburners are the duly authorized enforcers of an insolent government's recipe for keeping the masses "happy". Nicholas Roeg's striking camerawork and use of color are outstanding. Bernard Hermann's score is one of the best ever. The combined talents create something very engaging.One of two films Truffaut did after authoring a book-length interview with Alfred Hitchcock. The other film, "The Bride Wore Black" is an outright homage to Hitchcock. Both films feature excellent musical scores by former Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Hermann. Sadly Hitchcock and Hermann stopped working together at this time. Universal made the colossal blunder of encouraging Hitch to work with other composers to the complete detriment of all his later films beginning with "Torn Curtain".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this movie was horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love sci-fi movies, and especially those real sci-fi movies that rely on idea rather than action. I was looking forward to seeing this and finally caught it, but was really really disappointed.I think this was the first Truffaut movie I've seen so I had no idea what his style is. I've seen some Nicolas Roeg movies, so in that department I had expectations.The beginning is great, altho somewhat theatrical, but the idea of announced credits with some nice visual trickery and the concrete suburbs of 60s London was a great starter for the movie, I was really excited. Too bad it was all downhill after this.First off, Oskar Werner is horrible in the lead role, just amazingly bad. I just kept thinking how the movie would've been if they'd cast someone with even a little bit of charisma in the role. Werner was so uninspired and tired all through the movie. Afterwards I read that he and Truffaut didn't really see eye to eye and it shows, it really shows. I was also distracted by his accent. I didn't know him before, so I thought he was french, but at times his accent was clearly German, I don't know if he was supposed to be British, German, French ...Julie Christie does a good job, but the double role is somewhat weird. She's good as Clarisse, but the role as Montags wife is a bit so-so. There doesn't seem to be a clear idea behind the double role. Cyril Cusack does by far the best role in the movie, he's the only one who seems to have a clear idea of his character. Anton Diffring's main character is left as a shadow of what it could be and why was he cast as the headmistress also? It looked as a joke when he/she peaked from the window. I'd understand this choice of using just a few performers to portray many people if Truffaut had deliberately wanted to show that people are the same mass and alike, but this idea is not really executed very well.The whole script is a bit lacklustre in my opinion. The idea and premise are very interesting, but what ended up on screen is just dull and uninteresting.There are times when the movie looks good, I would've liked to see more of this early spring concrete suburbia. But instead you get to see the country side. Nothing really wrong with that either, but the locations don't really match, you get no idea how the world really looks in this dystopian future. The monorail gets amazingly lot of screen time, Truffaut must've thought it looked really futuristic. The scenes in the cafe in the city (or something, I don't know), look very much like a studio and are not that great really.You also see a lot of the fire truck driving. This looks actually quite comical as the firemen are standing stiff and just holding a pole with one hand while the truck is driving really fast.I wasn't too impressed by Nicolas Roeg's cinematography either. They must've had the worst dolly grip in the world as the camera was shaking like crazy when ever there was a moving camera. Then there's this one single scene that introduces a split screen kind of effect, covering the other side of the screen with black matte. What was that about?Such a frustrating movie to watch. You want it to get better as it goes, but it never does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the film is dated and much was left out but some of the comments are just plain ridiculous and show that some here don't actually "watch" film. The comment about the Book Lady's death convinced me of this. If the dialog is listened to--you find out that she did this to protect all of the hidden book people-not just because of what the books meant to her! Irregardless of the original book, I think the movie is rather prophetic considering the mindless sludge people watch on TV. "The Family" video program in the film reminds me off all those pointless "reality" shows on today. To complain that the film is slow moving and boring is crap. Watch it--study it and it will reveal so many things, unlike what is passed off as film today. The film opens with the book reader eating an apple. How many of you got this? I'd love to see some responses. Having Julie Christie play two parts was interesting as well. It made for a nice contrast between the two characters and explains what might have led Montag to abandon his life and job. The film also makes the point several times that the system helped create a way for books to survive. All of the memorization exercises you hear throughout the film. The book lady even gives a hint before she dies. It is rather sad that the message of the film is being played out somewhat today. Books were boring and had nothing to offer but grief. Films today, to be appreciated, have to be feature length MTV videos. Name one Hollywood film this year that is worth pondering over after viewing? (excluding Fahrenheit 9/11. Like it or not--it has caused discussion!)</fullReview>

This movie not only makes you wonder what's going to happen but it also has many secret messages which I still can't figure out. i don't think you need to read the book to be able to follow the story of the movie, as long as you read the back of the video cover you will be fine.

		<shortDescription>i see all these raving reviews but i thought it was horrible so here goes:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i thought this was a really bad movie because:- horrible acting. The timing of miss-en-scene. Dialogue. Really bad. - empty sound-design. - Super tacky props. - the sloppy camera-moves (that were too ambitious) - having 2 completely different characters played by the same person and have them look pretty much the same, is saying that you, the viewer, are stupid. Come on. Unless there is some weird reason why they'd look the same, why do it? In the beginning one its stated she looks like the wife, but thats something else as to say "i look EXACTLY alike'. And no, people in 1966 weren't stupid. - The film-stock was ugly. Very flat. Felt more like TV than film, and this is supposed to be a science fiction film. The only shots that looked good were the ones with fire in them. - perhaps this wasn't yet a standard practice yet, but i think this film would've been a bit better if it were filmed in anamorphic, helping the science fiction feel. - these guys in white latex shirts and pants. Whut? - The 'niece' running from the law but getting out of public transport at her usual stop (a 1 minute walk from her own house) - did i mention the sound-design? - While i do appreciate looking for new forms of editing and camera-moves, lots of them did not help the story, but just felt like gimmicks. Some unwarranted slow-mo's, zoomed in on the film-negatives. - the baby with the tiny book. Really? If it were a comedy, ha ha. With this film; not so much. - The whole change of mindset by Montag was done so fast, i really didn't know why he actually changed. - Jet packs. - the guy with the apple. - that handshake. - the man doubting if he should report any one. overacted. very predictable. - Montag's bathrobe. - He's taking the stairs instead of the pole. WHAT A REBEL!!!1! - was that fire suit some reference to the KKK? - The blood bag thats given to Montag's wife. - skin-colored lipstick. - that train set-piece you know probably costs half of the total budget. - the grandmaster of finding hidden things hides all his OWN books exactly at those places he's telling his pubescent students to look, including the toaster. - and, worst of all: the whole concept of people burning books because they make you unhappy is just stupid. Maybe the film didn't do the book justice (i really hope so). It wasn't made believable at all. I was waiting to be convinced but it didn't happen. What i also found very weird, and a little bit disturbing, is that if you're going to talk about books being banned, i am going to think of religious texts first (its clearly a non- religious society, in a religious society it would be the non-religious books) but not 1 single reference of a bible, Koran, or any other religion. Also, the believability of people reciting a book and trusting that to be a good preservation method is just laughable. Especially by a kid listening to a mumbling dying man. people, this film was not good for its time. This was a bad movie. Maybe there was little money? Then make a smaller film. Good for its time? 2001 a space odyssey was probably in production at that time. Solyaris was made a couple of years after that. So yeah no.8 thumbs down for this film. 2 thumbs up because Truffaut made the 400 blows which was amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much admired in its day, but now rather passé, this novel-based movie about book-burning doesn't make a great deal of sense and really falls apart in its final scenes with the ridiculous "book people". What about punctuation in the memorized books? Neither writers nor readers would bother with punctuation, if it wasn't absolutely necessary. Punctuation, as we know it, is comparatively recent. It dates from the 15th century A.D. At least half of the hundreds of problems that Bible translators wrestle with, for example, center around punctuation. The way you punctuate a sentence can drastically alter its meaning. That's why we have so many Bible translations, all of them different. Without altering a single word, you can translate John's Gospel, for instance, to make Peter the fall guy. And I have in fact done this, because I believe that is how it was meant to be translated. The fact that the author of the Gospel is plainly jealous of Peter and doesn't like him, is for me the number one factor in that Gospel's authenticity. Getting back to the movie, one wonders why paperbacks seem to be a special favorite of the book-burners. Because they didn't stretch the movie's budget? Also, if books are banned, there is no need to teach people to read. And if people can't read the books anyway, why make such a song-and-dance about ferreting the books out and destroying them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"451" Should Never Be Burned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that you literally see past all the little flaws and become totally engaged because their is so much truth in this story, it transcends being a movie and gets down to the fundamentals of human nature and the uneven "progress" of civilization and how individuals react in it. Although this film does not rigidly follow the book, Bradbury did not object, and both the novel and the film can stand alone or together as significant works of art. Oscar Werner is perfect for this film, just as he was for "Shoes of the Fisherman"--he is a master of internal conflict within himself and with his world. Julie Christie's beauty, like in Dr. Zhivago does not distract from the film because it is so much a part of the fabric of the film, the contrast in her duality of role shows two kinds of contrasting beauty. The sets and costuming are basic, almost laughable, but their simplicity focus you on the acting which is well supported by the very non-American but yet very recognizable cast to Americans. The interesting Anglo/Germanic appearing cast was done in a manner to not introduce and distract with new faces, but to allow focus on the story. I give it a nine, not for it's technical elegance (which it never intended to obtain), but for a serious film telling a very serious story in a fictional future environment in a very elegant manner. Some films need to be allowed to fade away, "451" needs to be one of the "keepers". It is a film that should never be burned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone to Watch Over Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his 1966 film "Fahrenheit 451", Francois Truffaut illuminates ideas Isaac Asimov laid down in his 1953 science fiction novel of mass media, information control and personal privacy, thus anticipating our current debate on net neutrality by more than 50 years.In "Fahrenheit 451&#x2033; written knowledge is the enemy. Guy Montag is a man whose job it is to burn books, not just some books, all books.In Montag's world, televised media is recognized as the legitimate source of information. Instead of reading it for themselves in their voices the citizens of Montag's world get their information from neat looking, prerecorded talking heads blandly reciting prepared statements. This intel comes in over the large monitors in every room of Montag's home and in all the public places as well.When Montag becomes interested in the books he is burning his superiors immediately attempt to seduce him back into conformity. Thus we learn that those ubiquitous monitors also provide the authorities the means to eves drop on Montag.The opening credit sequence is one of the most brilliant and powerful moments in the film consisting not of the customary flashcard of lines of text crediting writer, producer, director, and keys. This movie begins with an audio track of the credits read aloud to you by a deep, officious male voice. This soundtrack is accompanied by still shots of houses and buildings with row upon row of television antennas mounted on each of them. Even before the story unfolds Truffaut ignites the audience with this flash of genius, an immediate, visceral example of how our world would look, sound and feel were the written word outlawed.Montag reads enough to see through the media seduction and retreats from his status as book burner. The former enforcer slips out of sight of the monitors. He joins a secret colony of rebels dedicated to memorizing books and preserving them.What "Fahrenheit 451&#x2033; illustrates brilliantly is how people are the source of knowledge, not books (nor the Internet). Flash backward from Montag's to my day and to this time. The Internet is not so much an invention of man as a deepening awareness of our agelessness interconnection.The Internet will not thrive on greed alone. The Internet will be equally infused with common sense, or else the Internet will die. Same goes for the human race. Knowledge is born and lives in minds, not on hard drives or digital screens. Humans cannot be masters of the Internet any more than humans can master nature.Attempts to capture and control the truth are futile. Common sense teaches all people the important lessons. Still, we are all curious to know each others secrets. Don't we all know our dirty little secret anyway? It comes down to this. We are all to some degree, selfish and calloused toward the fate of each other. The net neutrality debate is a perfect example. Those who attempt to control information do so for selfish reasons, then make up excuses for why it is a good idea.It should not surprise us to find ourselves in this predicament over privacy. We were prepared for the digital revolution's profusion of lenses well before "Fahrenheit 451&#x2033; aligned minds. In one of our much older and more popular science fiction stories, John's hallucination in the "Book of Revelation" describes a lamb all covered with eyes. In that prophet's endgame, we stand naked before God and the Devil and all eyes are watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visionary and thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 451 is a visionary movie based on Ray Bradbury's novel of the same title. It is set in an imaginary aseptic world with a sterile society that thrives on TV plasma screens, on burning books, and on superficial relationships.The movie is an allegory about what a world without books and culture would be, an ode against ignorance and simple minds, a reminder that burning books is a sign of human degradation and typical of tyrannical regimes. It is also an homage to Literature, in this case to Truffaut's fav books, as most of the books burnt are French titles and authors.The movie honors Bradbury's visionary novel. Think about our modern world, dominated by big plasma screens hanging from the walls in which reading and culture are each time less valued and appreciated. Think about those reality shows in which our opinion is asked as a way of creating a false sense of community and participation, when our answers are, indeed, irrelevant. Think about a world in which the information is manipulated by the media to support the political regime in vogue... It sounds familiar, no? These themes are fantastically presented in the film.All the actors are great in their roles. Cyril Cusak is truly convincing as the fire brigade captain, completely sure his Mission and about the danger of books for Society. Oskar Werner is also great as fireman Montag, going from a hieratic starting to a soulful mood when his character starts to change and read books. Julie Christie is great in her double role as Montag's wife Linda and neighbor book-reader Clarisse. I loved that while Linda is very feminine and sensual on the exterior, she's emotionally frigid, while her counterpart Clarisse, who is dressed boyishly and has short hair, has a special warmth and sensuality that comes from her cultivated inner world.The colors of the movie are not randomly chosen. The movie offers subdued gray and pastel tones, not especially likable, which are constantly highlighted by two main color, a beautiful dark gray (as the society that represents, especially clear in the children school uniforms), and and a beautiful intense deep red (associated to fire and the burning of books). However, Truffaut would have preferred a movie in B&amp;W, but the producers forced him differently. I think a BW would have suited the movie better, and made it even more timeless.The OST by Bernard Herrmann is magnificent, dramatically neurotic sometimes, lyric some others, while the tune that accompanies the fire squad's outings is very Ravel-ish and anticipative (and catchy) and sets the pace of the movie. Most of the time the music is unsettling. I thought it was overwhelming sometimes, too, and I did not like that.The end of the movie is just magnificent, so lyric, so full of hope. The whole snow scene and recitation of the old man with his grandson is pure beauty, and so moving.I watched this movie for the first time on TV when I was about 13y.o., many years ago!, and it had a huge impact on me. In fact, I forgot the title but not the movie. and the message The reviewing of the movie proofs that there is a reason for that impact, as the movie stands the past of time as all the themes discussed are still relevant for our world.The only think that does not stand the pass of time are the fashion and, above all, the special effects, which are very much outdated and made me laugh when re-watching it recently. However, the movie has a lot of experimental things that are still daring today. For example, the opening credits, all spoken, no word written until we see The End at the end of the movie, or the scene in which half the screen goes black.A movie that will move immensely to all of us who have thrived on books and still think that written culture and knowledge highlight more our spirit than any religion.</fullReview>

The colours, the brilliant use of futuristic housing estate locations around suburban London, the monorail set, the standout use of spoken word credits at the beginning of the film (to make the point that the society we were watching had banned books and the written word), the highly creative finish where the actors walk around reciting passages from classical books in wintry scenes. Credit should go to Mr Bradbury for some of these ideas in the novel, but Mr Truffaut also adds some magic to the story. Great acting too from Mr Werner and Mr Cusack.

		<shortDescription>The strongest impression was definitely the book people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Truffaut's film many times and every time I watch it I think and feel differently about it. I guess this is an evidence we are dealing with a piece of art, an art-film. Recently, when I saw it, I felt that it conveyed such a strong emotion for books, or rather world literature, and for me that is the main theme of Fahrenheit 451. The strongest impression was definitely when the book people individually learned a book by heart, every word, every page and every chapter. How can you convey a stronger love for a book? This must be one of the strongest love emotions you can have for a particular book even though it is probably not realistic. I guess it is more realistic to learn a few poems or a few lines by heart, but you have to see it metaphorically, and maybe there actually are some rare people out there who did or do this tremendous act? According to my perspective, fundamental questions to think about after the viewing are: which book would you choose? or which book is really you? Wonderful film and I have never discovered this rare theme so deeply as in Fahrenheit 451.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Truffaut film, after nearly 43 years that it was made. I was surprised at its sharpness - how poignantly and truthfully it depicts our present (pathetic) society. Placing the film in current social contexts, we're facing exactly the same problems in the movie: media broadcasting and promoting outlook, fashion, vanity, ignorance, arrogance, superficial relationships. It's a society that people do not think (and are taught not to think). Ray Bradbury has successfully made a prediction of the future, and thanks for Truffaut who tastefully adapted the novel and represented it. Robert Horton observed that Fahrenheit 451 has never quite been accepted by Truffaut fans or sci-fi buffs. I think classifying this film as a sci-fi underestimates its profound and philosophical meanings, whereas the poetic and dream-like ending is very Truffaut - particularly when it was made so because of the precarious winter weather at the time of filming. (Note: In the Trivia section of this film on the IMDb website, it is noted that the location filming of the final sequence with the "Book People" took place in poor weather.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this says something about movie reviews and how we should take them from others. Just because a friend says they either like or dislike a movie and/or book and why we would even compare the two simply because the original story was adapted to a screenplay? Reading a book and watching a movie are as different and more so that comparing apples to oranges! A good point you make though about why anyone would even compare Audry Hepburn to Katherine Hepburn. Of course the younger generation may not know that they are not even related.I suppose many younger people have only seen the poorly made modern reproductions of many new Hollywood films lately. That is too bad, because the original masterpiece versions are usually always more impressive in acting, script set direction, etc., where modern films rely too heavily on cartoon special effects. The whiz-bang cartoon button pushing special effects today seem to be the short lived reason why these new remakes fail.-Mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Booklover's Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is extraordinary for its era in that it was made in 1966, well over forty years ago and its vision of the future incorporates so much of what the world has become.The premise of the film is this: books are considered a hindrance to a contented form of life as they exploit individualism and everyone is much happier if they are all equal and the same. Firefighters have been perverted into firestarters, their jobs are to burn books wherever they are found so that the status quo can be maintained.One fireman is subverted by a woman he meets on a train (the train is an extraordinary special effect in that it literally hangs from an overhead rail system). She asks him if he has ever read a book. This idea festers in him until he starts with one book and becomes hooked like a junkie into the world of books.I won't throw down spoilers. I found the prediction of people being hooked into interactive huge flat screens on the wall highly evocative of today down to the dumbing down of the populace who watch the inane activities of so-called stars, here known as 'cousins' to make it more intimate. Ray Bradbury, the author of "Fahrenheit 451" was apparently pleased with this adaptation of his classic work on censorship. The acting is also great. Oskar Werner is marvellous playing Montag who breaks rank. Julie Christie plays both the role of Montag's wife, Linda, and his friend Clarisse (originally a 16 year-old girl in the book). Cyril Cusack is terrific in the role of the zombie-like Captain Beatty - a man without emotion.Censorship is happening around us today, particularly in the schools. And more and more people are drifting away from the written word, the easier and lazier way is to be captivated by MP3 players and the giant screen - both so prescient in the film.The end of the film is something I would see again and again. Ray Bradbury has said that he cried like a baby watching it. I did too. Haunting and uplifting all at once, a great confluence of words and music and snow.9 out of 10. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you get over the minimalist almost ancient setting (the 60's seem light years away) and some rudimentary filming techniques that seem obsolete in the CGI era, you will find an amazing, although tragically underrated and unknown movie. But , like one of the characters says "you can't judge a book by it's covers". Bradbury more than matches the high standards set by his predecessors Orwell and Zamiatin, underlining in a unique way the absurdity of any totalitarian structure. In his socialist nightmare the books are the major public enemy, the cause of all unhappiness, dissent and inequality, therefore they must be eliminated for the greater good. You'll never see anyone as your equal after reading Plato's Republic, Robinson Crusoe is a tyrant for having the "coloured" Friday as his servant and autobiographers only satisfy their own vanity The adaptation of the 1953 novel into the movie undoubtedly does it justice. Powerful contrasts are inserted all throughout the movie as a form of emphasis , a mockery in the face of anyone who allows the government to think for him. Imagine a world in which you cannot remember how you met your spouse; in which the newspaper has only drawings; in which children are mindless robots and they live their life following orders from a TV set; in which the electric shaving machine is replaced by the latest invention , the razor-blade; in which the red pill stimulates you, the gold pill calms you down, altogether making you neutral. The inhumanity is represented especially by the main character Guy Montag, a firemen who, as the name says, is responsible for setting the books on fire. As most people he is an instrument, hasn't been curious about the books the burned. He slowly redeems himself as the plot goes on, a fact that doesn't elude the perceptiveness of the fire station pole, which refuses to take him up and down. As always, the first step is the hardest, opening a book. After that he can't seem to put them down, and it affects his personal life as well as his career. Naturally, the one who turns him in is the one who he loves (or is supposed to love), so after having to search his own house he is forced to set his own books on fire (poetic justice). Instead he sets the TV set on fire , as well as his superior (more poetic justice). Here the director adds another personal touch by which he portrays the feeling of despair, it is a dreadful thing to watch a book burn one page at a time. He manages to salvage one novel and runs away to join the "book people" , people who have dedicated their memory to one book , which no one can take away from them. The literary classics receive him as one of their own and the end leaves you hoping for a better world as you see all those people wandering through the woods reciting "themselves". If you had to choose, which book would you be? You already know my answer.</fullReview>

In fact, the pages under the fire, the dance of stubs and covers, the delicate ashes are the fundamental sign of film, recollection of feelings and trust in personal values, relation with the others and yourself, touch of things and colors of dreams and desire.Not the last- the end of movie.

The photography is excellent; the fact that the movie has that great 60s look to it doesn't hamper its futuristic content. The only drawback is the very silly ending, with people memorizing books by heart. Apart from the fact that only about one in a million people have the brain capacity/talent/ability to achieve such feats, why don't they merely hide the books in the ground, since they're obviously in nature, in the forest far away from their enemies? Kind of dumb, when you think about it: the book-readers in the cities hide the books even though there aren't good places to hide, while the forest readers memorize them!

		<shortDescription>The Medium Kills the Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really a well made film with good acting and strong images. I presume that it surpasses the novel it is based upon and rather doubt a remake will make any improvements. The message was a little conservative and contradictory, though. The burning of the books was not about substantial censorship like in Nazi-Germany, but obviously the regime was against books as communication media. What is so untruthful about this film (as a film) is that it claims government would prohibit books (as books), while in general books are rather "killed" by film makers. Then the story suggested that books have a certain subversive power and let people know deep truths and emotions, which the regime wants to conceal. It may be true that mass-media like TV or Internet contain more short-lived content than books do. But, this very film is proof that deep thoughts or feelings, in other words: high culture, is not something exclusive to books. So why should Montag kill other people (the firemen) to save a book - just a book? (Even if it is as good a book as Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination?) Actually, Truffault himself must have burnt loads of books - and all best classics - just for this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Will Most Likely Ruin This in a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a critic, I'm just a man who loves great cinema.If you ever get a day to shut out the world and experience a new world like you've never seen, this is the film. It's completely immersive, and one of the greats. Soon, I am sure, they will remake this and ruin it. But this film will remain, I hope. I have to admit, I bought a copy off ebay because it was out of print (which is terribly ironic). If anything good will come out of a remake, it will be a rerealease in HD-DVD and Blu-Ray of the original. I bet most people will never see the original, and it will be cheapened by better color quality, better special effects, and what have you, but perhaps there will be a few that will see that the artistry wasn't just in the paranoid-brilliant mind of Bradbury, but also a perfect marriage with a visionary this film's director. Cinematography is beautiful. A remake may be worth it, but not if it covers up this original and stunning film. Again, like most old films I suggest...just buy it.B.D.Kuchera</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as movie adaptations get...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 is an adaptation of a novel, and as such, it is not bad, but as usual with such pictures, the film comes up a bit short against the book. The film never really conveys to us that Captain Beatty is a well-read albeit strictly by-the-book (?!) man. We never see that he is a character who has discovered what is in books, but hasn't had the courage to rebel against the oppressive book-burning society as Montag has.The Hound is another difference. Indeed, the film might have been rendered a bit more suspenseful if François Truffaut had seen fit to include the mechanical Hound in the film. In the book, there is a heart-stopping moment as Montag climbs out of the river that he has used to escape his pursuers -- including the Hound -- and is confronted by a pair of glowing eyes in the night.The Hound!But it was only a deer. This would have given filmgoers a bit of a jolt in their seats if it could have been incorporated into the script, but alas, the film has no Hound.Fahrenheit 451 is about as good as novel adaptations get, but if you have read Bradbury's book, you might find the film a bit disappointing, and if you have seen the film but not read the book, read the book. It's quite a bit more gripping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pink Floyd's Another brick in the wall ("no thoughtcontrol")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is made after the book (1951), which surely is recognizable in some ways. Because of the expansion of communism after WW II there were many people afraid of Stalin's and Mao's way of building a society. How frightening that could be Julie Christie as Lara showed that to us in Dr. Zhivago (a year before Fahrenheit 451). Only the ones that hated the old democratic society in the west more than (the unknown consequence of) communism, or would benefit of it, could support the dictators. For many reasons the movie made me think of: 1. other movies about the subject like: Invasion of the bodysnatchers, 1984 (Orson Wells), and several other American S.F.films in the 50's 2. the communist-hunt around that period (50's), especially in America it became notorious. 3. In the 60's there was a revival of the communist popularity, and Fahrenheit 451 was made in the middle of that. 4. the nazi-bookburnings in the 30's. 5. Jan Palach; in 1968 this Tjech young chap burned himself to protest against the communist indoctrination that was taking over again. (SPOILER: In Fahrenheit 451 a woman has herself burnt together with books). The movie had my full attention because it was very intriguing how the story would develop it self and how it would finish. I must say: the end was a complete surprise. A fantastic invention to escape from the law that there can be no books that are not allowed by the authorities. Only free thinking people (like the booktellers) can be that creative in order to resist stupid laws. I saw a strong comparison with The John Steed - Emma Peel movies (same time in the 60's): hardly others than the necessary people are on the screen. And just like the Steed/Peel-series Fahrenheit 451 also is worth watching. Also remarkable is that: A. hardly any affection in that society. No (com)passion. B. the burning of the book `Mein Kampf', even that had to go. C. the materialism. D. the telling-society: send a note to the authorities to betray someone who is having books. E.the link to Germany: the fireman is named Montag (German for Monday) and he spoke with a German accent on purpose. Truffaut doesn't like Germany so short after the war ? Anyway: like always somebody starts to think, so Montag starts to doubt the law on books more and more. Montag has books, his wife Linda (well played by Julie Christie) does not know, and (SPOILER) leaves him when she finds out. Linda basically is a frigid, afraid woman, slavishly following the orders of the authorities. These orders come by TV-programs, like TV-preaching. Montag's neighbour girl (Clarisse, schoolteacher, also Julie Christie) whom he travels with to work is familiar with the group of booktellers and so his consciousness and courage is rising and come to a burstout. The goal of the author and the movie was made very clear: to show that mindcontrol in order to whatever purpose is leading to a chilling society without culture, pleasure and development of the human fantasy. Who would like to be in such a society ? Nobody ! All the actors did well on their performances, absolutely, I liked it. I also think that Oskar Werner was underrated here, and Julie Christie was doing a very good job on her two characters. Why she did two is a question of course: perhaps because she was already famous after Billy Liar, Dr. Zhivago and Darling (several nominations/awards) she was to give the movie extra publicity ? In that case: she didn't fail ! And gained another nomination. So see the movie. Hans Veldman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly effective movie of Ray Bradbury's science fiction classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury's original novel has been a favourite of mine since childhood, and is generally regarded as one of THE great dystopias, almost spoken of in the same breath as '1984' and 'Brave New World'. I saw Truffaut's movie on TV once when I was a kid, but that was many years ago, and I could hardly remember it. It's generally not that highly thought of so I was never motivated to watch it again. But on an impulse I did so recently and I was extremely surprised at how effective the movie is. Truffaut obviously worked closely with cinematographer Nic Roeg (later director of extraordinary movies like 'Don't Look Now', and 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', and co-director with the late Donald Cammell of one of my all time favourite movies 'Performance') and the movie is visually impressive. The score by Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann is also very good. Oskar Werner, who played Jules in Truffaut's celebrated 'Jules and Jim', is a bit of an unusual choice for a hero, but after a little while I really started to warm up to him. Julie Christie looks lovely as always, and is very impressive in a duel role, as Werner's wife and as the girl who makes him rethink his lifestyle as a fireman, that is, a book burner. Cyril Cusack, who previously appeared with Werner in 'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold', and Anton Diffring, from 'Circus Of Horrors', a real favourite of mine, round out the supporting cast. 'Fahrenheit 451' the movie isn't completely successful, and I still prefer the book, but it's one of the more intelligent SF movies of the 1960s, and much better than many people would have you believe. The closing sequences are a lovely poetic image and quite moving. Soon to remade, but I'm almost 100% certain that the new version won't be half as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New DVD Does the Film Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recently released DVD of the movie has a surprising amount of extras that reveal several interesting things about the movie. These extras include a scene specific commentary edited from several tracks including Julie Christie, Ray Bradbury, as well as the film's producer and editor. Also included is a brand new 45 minute documentary, and 10 minute interview with Ray Bradbury discussing the origins of the novel.One of the most interesting things revealed was that the emotionless, simple dialog of the film was deliberate because it was felt that a society without books would contain inarticulate people. Another is that the Bradbury and the film makers did not think of the work as science fiction, and they felt this was one of the reasons that the film was not well received when it was released --namely that viewers went expecting a sci-fi story, and got a social commentary piece instead.All and all, a worthwhile DVD and a movie definitely worth a second look!</fullReview>

After seeing the hoopla recently (winter of 2000) with the US election, Ray Bradbury's fictional world of F-451 doesn't seem too campy as some of the reviews would have you think. A complacent population deadened by sedatives &amp; television seems out of place? Maybe because we're already halfway there but without the book-burnings yet! When the religious zealots &amp; spin-meisters are able coddle the masses as they did with Bush/Gore, then it's not a bad idea that movies &amp; stories like F451 are around! The ironic thing is the people crying about the cheezy special effects are the types that would be happier with an in-the-wall TV set playing the latest George Lucas flick with great special effects and little meaningful dialogue.</fullReview>

Oskar Werner gives a fine portrayal as the main character, while Julie Christie is truly stunning in her dual role. These two hold the film together, although it must be said that the other actors do a good job. Bernard Herrmann, as usual, provides a fine musical score, and much enhances the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glad to see all the positive remarks about this movie, since it seems to take a critical beating most of the time. To me, this film has always been Truffaut's big homage to Hitchcock - the wife/girlfriend doppelganger (from "Vertigo"), Montag's dream of the old women's death (also "Vertigo," and plenty others, too!) the scene in the school, with the chanting of children doing lessons always audible ("The Birds"), the homosexual subtext of the two bickering firemen ("Rope")... those are the elements that come quickly to mind. As well as an overall "look" and camera set-ups right out of "Marnie" and, of course, the Bernard Herrman soundtrack - one of his best, in my opinion! Definitely an underrated film worth a look.

		<fullReview>Yes, my own children hate it, most my countrymen hate it. The Science Fiction label leads to great disappointment. Don't expect special effects. Don't expect quick action. Expect close ups and insight. Expect rigid camera-work and sometimes pompous music. Expect feelings. I must say that the images in the film are deeply engraved in my subconscious, and that the references in the film are so necessary to understand it, that it is nearly unwatchable for most people. It is like watching "Scary Movie" for someone who hasn't seen any of the films it parodies. Do your homework. Watch the films mentioned in Woody Allen's early movies and then work your way up Truffaut and Goddard. After that you might be ready for this film. Of course you might not want to do that. Read the book, instead. The film decided to follow a different path, and the book, I must say, has a lot more action. I loved the mechanical hounds, by the way. My boys would have loved the film if they were in it. But they aren't. Be warned. I love the film. You might hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the reality of television now pervading our lives to a greaterdegree than ever before, this movie seems to hit its' targets withprecision, almost forty years ahead of its time.With neat and crisp direction, some wonderful dialogue and afantastic score, the film clips along at a fast pace. The world oftomorrow (as seen from a 1966 perspective) is cold, advancedtechnically but sterile. The same attitude is reflected in the rolesplayed by an excellent ensemble cast of British character actors,including the beautiful Julie christie, and the under-used CyrilCusack. Oskar Werner, as Montag, manages to convey not just thesterility of his world but also the need to explore the world ofliterature even at the cost of his own place within the technocraticsociety of the future.Wonderfully designed, the toytown fire engine is a superb creation,451 plays on the sixties fears of technology over humanism. ThatTruffaut creates a real world (especially in today's climate) and anuncaring world shows how this minor (and often neglected film)deserves reappraisal.Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Truffaut's masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a particular movie in François Truffaut's career. The director loved doing romantic and (above all) intimate movies -he was one of Nouvelle Vague leading directors. "Fahrenheit 451" is instead a Sci-Fi film based on Ray Bradbury's work; it is also the only Truffaut's English language opus.From an aesthetical point of view the film is very old, this feeling can be deeper when we compare it to Stanley Kubrick's "2001" -a film released two years later and that still looks modern. But after all "Fahrenheit" shows another idea of future, as it was seen in 1966...The most important thing in this film is not the visual aspect. The story and the message are stronger than that and still valid. A policeman -whose job is burning books and killing readers- finally understands the importance of culture and fight against dictatorship, which kills freedom and creativity. He chooses to join the book people -a group of outcast persons who live away from the ruled society and learn by hearth books, in order to teach them to the next generations.To me this story (in some ways similar to Orwell's "1984") is powerful and moving. I love this film very much for these reasons. Actors are wonderful (Julie Christie is so young and fresh...!), Bernard Herrmann's music is exciting and the film never bores.To me this film is an unforgettable experience. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

The plot thickens as we learn why the world these people live in are against books. We learn and question the answers, but by then, it is too late and we are forced to see two worlds both lost in ignorance. A clever moment in the film is when they show a copy of Hitler's: My plan and insist that 'all books' must be burned. Which also includes the propaganda that most likely led to the destruction of a world with books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont think this film should be compared to the book or the book to the film as they are completely different objects, with that said i enjoyed for the most part Francois Truffaut's adaptation of Farenheit 451.The acting by Oskar Werner,Julie Christine and the rest of the actors is somewhat ankward, so is the screenplay, I wonder how it would've worked out if Truffaut would've done it in french, but still its effective nevertheless.The visual style by Truffaut used here is nicely done and so is the cinematography and editing also the film (and the book as well) touch grounds that are still powerful nowadays and that i couldn't help but to identify with.Character development is good enough however the flaw with this film is that i think Truffaut could've made the film's world and its characters more complex, and i was kind of dissapointed after seeing the brilliant "The 400 Blows" and "The Soft Skin" which i consider film masterpieces. Another problem is that the film heavily slows down in the middle, Truffaut could've used this chance to introduce us more into how the world of the film (or book) is.It does not hold up to what such a great and influential filmaker like Truffaut could've achieved with such a fantastic piece of book writing. But it remains an interesting, poweful, mildly entertaining, visually stunning with good perfomances and mildly entertaining8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Discovering François Truffaut's adaptation of 451F is like uncovering a musty, tatty but intriguing old paperback in a boot fair. It's like rummaging through a time capsule buried by a bunch of school kids watching the dawn of a nuclear age. It's a film, I imagine, science fiction buffs have shunned since it's inception for it's lack of hi tech gadgetry (apart of those dodgy, yet endearing, jet pack thingys the firemen employ during Montag's chase scene) and rather personal take on Ray Bradbury's original story. From a design perspective it's fascinating, taking in to account every 'modern' ideal from Book Jackets to Home Furnishings to Public Transport, all lavishly shot in minute detail. 451F is not a great film but it is none the less a fascinating period piece for a future that was (thankfully) never to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book and film have not aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[minor spoilers]Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 has not aged well in the 50 years since it was published and neither has this movie. It is now possible to put an entire printed library on a CD- ROM (in 1986 there was a CD-ROM of 1001 classics in text format) and TV antennas have disappeared not because people are reading books but because of cable, satalite TV, and the internet. Bradbury's firemen are out of a job before they even get started.Also there are major logic holes in both the book and film. If books are regularly burned than how do people know how to read?! Also if this society has been around a while who is printing the books that are so available given that fireman Guy Montag manages to accumulate a huge library in a short time? Furthermore the idea that people are saving the knowledge for later by memorizing it is idiocy; as anyone will tell you that is the worst possible method to use.Bradbury's future seems to have itself a split personality and as a result so does the film. It is hard to take a book and film seriously if their basic premises are so out in left field.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking forward to the new version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This free-wheeling adaptation of Bradbury's classic novel is intriguing, but doesn't quite work. By conflating the Clarisse and Faber characters, it halves the exposition but it also halves the power of the story. For me, Faber is the novel's central character, and without his insightful defense of literature and freedom we only get one side of the argument. In Truffaut's film, no one explains WHY books are important, why they matter - so given that Montag only becomes violent AFTER he starts reading, this version comes dangerously close to supporting Captain Beatty's argument: an ignorant society is a safe one. It becomes less a story about censorship and "the forgetting of history" as a means of social control, and more about the repressed emotions that reading might unlock. While this does pick up on one of Bradbury's minor recurring themes - the importance of "the natural" - it isn't "Fahrenheit 451". Moreover, the relentlessly miserable look of this film misses Bradbury's point. His dystopian future isn't grim: it's a hyper-real America of neat green lawns and porch-less houses, a facade of state-sanctioned happiness masking the horror within. Truffaut's just looks like East Germany. I'm not sure why he went so far off track, because adapting this novel isn't difficult. I wrote an adaptation of it as a college screen writing assignment and found that if you stick with the book, it pretty much falls into place. Bradbury himself has said: "My books are movies already. Just take out the pages and stuff them in the camera." While that isn't quite true (there are huge slabs of melodramatic dialogue to be culled, and plenty of anachronisms to weed out), there is a lot to be said for faithful adaptations of his work - especially this one. There are few writers in sci-fi - or in any genre - who combine Bradbury's native talent for visual storytelling with such an intelligent interest in big themes. "Fahrenheit 451" is crying out for a remake. The case it puts is resurgently relevant, and our digital technology makes screening its disturbing and beautiful images entirely possible, even easy. Frank Darabont ("The Shawshank Redemption", "The Green Mile", "The Majestic" and scribe of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein") is slated to write and direct a new version for Castle Rock Entertainment sometime soon. Darabont has a great eye and a strong sense of story. More than anyone else in Hollywood today, he knows how to tell this kind of tale. If he can just resist the urge to "go Capra" and turn it into some kind of sappy, futuristic Norman Rockwell painting, I'm confident he's the man to pull it off. With it's memorable characters, compelling plot and powerful themes, it has Oscar® written all over it. I can see it now... Keanu Reeves (in "Speed" mode) as Montag, Anthony Hopkins as Faber, Robert De Niro as Captain Beatty (although Frank will probably cast Jeffrey DeMunn!)... in the right hands, it's a cross-category winner just waiting to be born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury's 1953 classic novel FAHRENHEIT 451 brought us along on a journey to a future world where the written word was banned. But it also showed other "small details" like a mechanical hound that attacked fleeing book-owners with a lethal dose of morphine. ...like the characters' thoughts of war starting literally any second, foreshadowed by the ominous flight of unknown aircraft.BOOK SPOILER ALERT - The following paragraph will contain text on the denouement of the F451 novel.The city was destroyed, gone in a giant boom! This is what happened to Montag's hometown after he left to join the book people. What was supposed to happen at the very end of the story. However, Truffaut's film version ended unsuitably, with the book people walking around, reciting books. Of course, the book people were meant to memorize books, but I believe that the film could have had a touch of Bradbury's original ending. It's as if BBC had ended Oliver Twist at the 4 hour point, where it could have ended if a few things were changed, rather than hour 6. The ending should have been restored after test screenings. It has happened for other films.However, Truffaut's film is visually interesting and does employ clever cinematographic techniques.Yet all of this combined, I don't know how to place it on the "star rating scale."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant idea, but hideously dated and remarkably tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS If you ask someone to name something evil that the Fascists in Germany did during their time in power, one topic which will rarely be mentioned, but which aught to be, is that they destroyed countless books. Attempting to limit individual thought, Hitler's Nazis had enormous bonfires as they destroyed works of great beauty. Author Ray Bradbury obviously was aware of this since in the 1950s he created his own tale of book burning called 'Fahrenheit 451'. Made into a film 10 years later, Bradbury's tale would be transformed into a major Hollywood movie. Skipping forward to the turn of the century however, and we are left face to face with a film that feels not only incredibly dated, but which frustrates throughout, by it's inability to create even the slightest tension or emotion. Directed by French directorial genius Francois Truffaut, this unfortunate film is a huge shadow of it's former self, and it is a disappointing watch.Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman in the future. Unlike the firemen of today, the men of the future are feared and hated. Travelling around the area, Montag and his firemen colleagues burn and destroy any book they find. One day after an encounter with beautiful teacher Clarisse (Julie Christie) however, Montag feels inclined to actually open a book. Now, hooked on a luxury we so often take for granted, Montag risks the life he has lived for the freedom to read.Like so many other dystopian ideas, the basic philosophy of 'Fahrenheit 451' is a sound one. Set in a world where we are deprived of books because they supposedly cause us misery, the story has the potential to be up there amongst the true greats. It's an incredible shame therefore that the film just never really fulfils it's potential.It's difficult to know where this actually adaptation of the story falls over really. Made in the 1960s, the fashions are very distinctive of a bygone time, and as a result, the film as a whole does feel increasingly dated.At the same time however, the film suffers from a strong lack of tension and emotion. Key scenes, most notably the death of an old lady, are flat and fail to inspire even the slightest response. Due to a combination of bad acting, weak special effects and some horrendous camera work, these scenes are incredibly amateur in style and simply should have been done better.As Montag, Oskar Werner is difficult to really evaluate. Playing a role which he has definitely made his own, he suffers slightly from the fact that in such a distinctively American surroundings, he is so ridiculously German. Coming from Austria, it's not his fault that his accent is what it is, but a bit more vocal teaching would have been useful because during much of the film, not only does he seem out of place, but his voice is difficult to fully hear. Still, despite his flaws, Werner does have moments of powerful emotion, and for that he deserves praise.If anything, the one unusual element in this production of 'Fahrenheit 451' are the two performances of Julie Christie. Playing both the wife and the mistress, it's not difficult to see the attempted comparison between the characters. Unfortunately though, Christie often fails to truly get her teeth into the character of the wife. As the mistress there's no denying that she's great, but as the wife, she often feels monotoned and unimpressive.Made in the 1960s, it's not hard to see why so many might love this film. As a part of their childhood, there's no denying that 'Fahrenheit 451' would have been impressive upon it's release. Unfortunately though, the film has not dated well. Add into this equation a distinctive lack of tension, and sadly we are left with a film which just doesn't cut it anymore. A film for the history books maybe, but unlike so many films from the era, it really shouldn't make an appearance in the present. Great idea, bad product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fahrenheit 451 review/analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review- Fahrenheit 451 Imagine, for a moment, a world in which the News could not be published in a newspaper. Or you would be permitted to read a book to put yourself to sleep at night. No Bible to preach from, no law book to defend. This is the nightmarish world imagined by Ray Bradbury and redefined by the French auteur Francois Truffaut. This is the world of Fahrenheit 451. Adapted for the screen and released in 1966, this film is now being re- released on DVD in an effort to re-find its audience. At its heart Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction film of the philosophical and sociological kind. Although the narrative and the characters are fairly straightforward the many relatable concepts that Francois Truffaut manages to delve into is evident of his status as the king of new wave cinema. Even if the film is as boring as watching a monkey pick its flees, it certainly doesn't lack depth. Fahrenheit 451 tells the story of a deeply dull and depressed fireman, played sluggishly by Oscar Werner, named Montag in an equally dull and depressed society in which all forms of literature have been banned and the firemen are condemned to burn all the books they find. Society has thus stagnated and the individuals that inhabit the world are uncreative and boring due to the lack of creative influences that books possess. This idea is contrasted through Montag's wife Linda, who is deprived of creative energy and sits at home and watches her wall screen TV, and Clarisse, who reads books and is insightful and interesting. Many other films of its genre aim to entertain more than anything and look for style over substance in an effort to create a film that is mindless in its deeper concepts. Fahrenheit 451 does the complete opposite in that we get the idea that Francois Truffaut has used this concept and created this world purely to highlight the effects that a misguided society can have on its individuals but hasn't so much looked to create an entertaining and engaging film. Although it has much deeper meanings than it first appears (thanks heavily to the source material) Mr Truffaut has not thoughtfully processed how these concepts can be transformed from the book and into the film, so what we are left with is a visual text ironically abundant of words. Fahrenheit 451 lacks the engaging vigour seen in many other science fiction films of the past yet I congratulate Truffaut for creating a wholly believable world that is in many ways reminiscent of the world we live in now. One would expect it to be engaging from its themes but in the end poor acting and dispassionate direction lead it astray. Perhaps it isn't his fault (although no-one else's) but Truffaut's humorous bordering layback style of direction doesn't adequately counterbalance the morality of Ray Bradbury's ideas. Francois Truffaut has put a lot of effort into creating this future dystopia but not enough into the characters who, despite the journey they go on, remain rather 2- dimensional. This might be the angle that Francois Truffaut was going as the society they live in is equally dull but Truffaut doesn't try to elaborate on them as we don't get the feeling that the characters are humans that have been driven to depression overdrive but we see them as robotic beings. No healthy measure of simple human nature has been brought into the characters and there is no evidence of the implications of what will ultimately become of humans. Certain technical aspects of the film hit the right notes but in turn aren't used in the correct way and thus don't provide the mood that one would expect from this type of film. The score, provided by Bernard Herrmann, exuberates paranoia and gives it an edge of thriller in the moments when the fire brigade are off to burn some books. We feel that perhaps something bad is going to happen and then the termination of the music in climatic moments serves as being anti-climactic as I feel that the music is displaced in relation to the images. In terms of acting I believe that the real problem, among many, is that the actors were not given proper direction and so lack the specific opportunities to meaningfully develop their characters. Instead they stick the script (which already lacks characters development) and let the narrative change their characters rather than layering the characters on their own terms. Oscar Werner portrays a rather boring character that floats through life oblivious to the surrounding unjust, militia style of government and remains content with conformity. In many ways he hasn't got a lot to work with but it's evident to see that he doesn't fully engage himself into the role. He seems to be imitating what his character should be like rather than becoming possessed into the role like got actors should. Also to note is his lack of chemistry with co-star Julie Christie, who also needs a lesson on giving a layered performance and also rests upon the narrative to develop her character(s) The conclusion to the film is rather unsatisfactory as it isn't black or white and is open to interpretation. Truffaut doesn't manage to cast a specific tone onto the ending and nor are the actors able to conclude their characters. Yet this open ending cannot be personally remedied by any form of philosophical opinion. We are simply left to ponder whether or not society will take a 'u turn' to regain its kinetic energy and push forwards into the future. The bitter sweet ending in which our protagonists are left in is, once again, not crafted into the correct fashion and lacks closure. The Verdict Francois Truffaut's venture into science fiction works as a philosophical study (although the deeper meanings are spelt out for the viewer blatantly) but lacks the stylistic chops and indulgent direction to successfully justify the morality and thoughtfulness of ray Bradbury's novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either I'm a dope or this film isn't very good. It's probably a little of each.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you think is really great, right up until you watch it. I t's based on a classic sci-fi story and this adaptation was written and directed by one of the great names in European cinema. In the past when I caught little bits and pieces of it on TV, what I saw seemed really good. Then I finally sat down to watch the whole thing and frankly?it kinda sucks.In a world where all new construction is fireproof and reading has been outlawed, Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman who burns forbidden books. He's good at his job and is in line for a promotion but after meeting a young woman one day, Montag becomes disenchanted with his life and his dull-witted wife. He starts reading books himself, hiding them around his home the exact way he's seen in other homes in which he found the books and burned them. Of course, Montag's lawbreaking is eventually discovered and he's forced to try and find someplace where reading isn't a crime and feeling isn't a formality.Bradbury's book is a lot more involved than that and there are more things that happen in this movie, but none of them really amount to anything. You certainly won't feel anything when you watch most of it. Seeing great books burned may stir some emotion, but the characters and their actions in this film are all weirdly cold, dry and bloodless. And while events happen, they don't really connect to each other and they certainly don't build upon each other. Take Montag's reading, for example. You would think there would be a series of scenes where he is gradually more and more tempted by books until he finally gives in to the temptation. That's not what happens, though. He just comes home with a book one day. You can tell that the movie tries to imply that it's Montag's interaction with the young woman that causes him to start reading, but that's not what the film actually presents to us. I don't think I'm missing any subtlety here, either.In some ways, this movie reminds me of Ang Lee's Hulk. While a tremendously talented storyteller, Lee's vision of that story wasn't what everyone else wanted to see. What he found interesting in Bruce Banner, Betty Ross and Ol' Greenskin wasn't what everyone else was interested in. People went to that film wanting to see a guy who turns into a super-strong monster when he gets angry. Lee spent the first half hour of Hulk focusing on how a woman's bad relationship with her father poisoned her interactions with other men.I think Truffaut brings the same sort of trouble to Fahrenheit 451. He doesn't appear either interested or capable of telling a conventional story and as great as the original book is, it's very conventional. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. It starts at Point A, builds to a climax and then finishes at Point Z. And while it clearly has a theme and a point of view, it's not at all metaphorical. Sci-fi allows an author to bring metaphors to life in a way that obviates the need or necessity for much subtext. Truffaut is able to pull off individual scenes, which is why it looked good when individual scenes are all I ever caught on TV, but he can't or won't connect them and order them in a compelling way. Instead, he just lets the story spill out and relies on heavily melodramatic music to generate some tension and energy, while he inserts several absurdist "arthouse" moments into the narrative.Truffaut also demonstrates contempt for his audience by having the character of the Fire Chief repeatedly explain the point of this story out loud. Apparently he was worried that people might walk out of the theater and wonder "Why were they burnin' them there books, Ethel?" I can't end this review without confessing to something. I didn't realize that Julie Christie actually played both the role of the young woman and Montag's wife until I saw it in the credits. That might say something about my powers of observation, but I think it says much more about how unengaging Fahrenheit 451 is and how little it makes you care about these people, their world and what happens in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Francois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 is a nearly fine adaption of Ray Bradbury's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen this movie in 25 years (when it aired, I think, on cable station WGN-TV in Chicago), I had an inkling to watch this again when my local paper, The (Baton Rouge) Advocate, had an item on their opinion page with the headline, "Smoking hot book event". It mentioned that Ray Bradbury's original book was the selection of "The Big Read: One Book/One Community" which is a program that encourages a discussion among readers of the same title. Today, February 9, was the official start of this event which will last through April. The "Smokin' Hot Kick-Off" Film Screening and Panel Discussion started around 2 in the afternoon at the BREC Independence Park Theatre and Cultural Center when, after a reception that included hot chili, a free screening of Francois Truffaut's version was shown with Louisiana Public Broadcasting president Beth Courtney taking a call from Bradbury just before the movie began. Bascally, the author said that children should start reading at least at 3 or 4 because after that they won't be as motivated. He also mentioned writing a new one called "We'll Always Have Paris", a title inspired by the fact that every year when his wife was still alive, they'd visit the city at least once during that time. Ms. Courtney also mentioned to the author of the possibility of maybe filming a new version of his novel in Baton Rouge because of the tax revenue the city gets. Mr. Bradbury mentioned that since he's 85 and now on a wheelchair, he can't travel as much anymore. Then Beth thanked him for the call and the movie started. After which there was a forum discussion that I stayed for 30 minutes before I had to leave for work. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's discuss the film: It starts with an announcer mentioning the standard movie credits, as opposed to being printed on screen, with a rooftop antenna moving closer each time. Then as Bernard Herrmann's haunting music plays, we see firemen going down the road. A man is in his house eating. He gets a call to get out. After he's gone, the firemen come in, put various books that were hidden in places like behind an old television screen in one pile, and burn them. Okay, I've now realized this review may be a little long so I'll just state my opinion: Truffaut may have thought the English-language dialogue may have been stilted but that seemed perfect for the way various people are being controlled by the way books have been banned from ever entering their thoughts. I almost cried when that old lady decided to burn herself among her pile of books instead of letting herself be forced to leave. And Montag's transformation, as portrayed by Oscar Werner, comes gradually when he first starts reading Charles Dickens' "David Copperfield" (including the publisher and copyright date) and then completely after he confronts his wife's lady friends by reading a book passage that makes one of them cry. Julie Christie herself is fine in portraying both Linda Montag and Clarisse, a girl Montag met on the monorail and befriends after she's let go of her teaching position. By the way, the boy who runs from her after she briefly returns to her former school is Mark Lester who would gain worldwide fame in the title role of Oliver! a couple of years later. One of the most disorienting scenes is when Montag, after work, discovers his wife lying on the floor, apparently passed out from prescription drugs, and, after the doctors have cured her, she just goes on as if nothing happened and becomes so bubbly she just can't wait to bed him! Then there's the now-common large wide screen TV and the characters on it asking "Linda" a question of whether she agrees with them or not and then saying she answered in the affirmative even when she doesn't say anything. At the end when one of the book people mentioned being "The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury", that got a little chuckle from the audience. With all that I've just mentioned, I'll just say Truffaut did a pretty good job in adapting "Fahrenheit 451".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably when people hear of Ray Bradbury's novel "Fahrenheit 451", they nowadays think of Michael Moore's documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11". Both have similar topics, namely the suppressing of information and reliance on brainlessness. Francois Truffaut's only English-language film is very well done, with Oskar Werner as the book burner starting to question his job. The parallels to the current state of affairs remain important, as society today seems to be one that does everything except burn books.Does the movie have any problem? Well, I can't tell whether or not Julie Christie is mainly there for looks (and believe me, she had those!), especially since she plays two roles. Also, the whole end sequence sort of comes across as funny, which I felt seems out of place in such a story. But otherwise, I thought that it was a very good and topical movie, and I certainly recommend it.In fact, I would recommend that you stop reading this review and go read a book. You may not be allowed to for much longer.I wonder why people always give the paper-burning temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The late/great Francois Trufaut has pulled off an amazing feat: he brings Ray Bradbury's classic Science Fiction novel to the screen with an abundance of wit, skill and creativity. The transition to the big screen looses nothing. Wonderful mood. Bernard Hermann's score is spirited and hits all the right notes. Nice touches: old fashioned telephones, straight razors, and flat screen televisions are mounted on walls. Beautiful and talented Julie Christie plays a dual role. And for once it makes sense to the plot. Both characters are distinct and separate people, and yet, they embody a similar soul. This is Trufaut's only English-speaking film. The opening credits are spoken--not written. Cool. There are quick zoom-ins on assorted rooftops and antennas. The shots of Montag, the reluctant hero, donning his asbestos-lined protective garb, are clever. Trufaut reversed the film and unfolded it again, to create a smooth and seamless take. It's sadistic fun to watch which books were chosen to burn in the fire. Depressing even. The producers were very lucky to have had an experimental monorail constructed in their backyard. The one-mile track and futuristic trains deliver a modern feel. Look fast for two brief appearances of a young actor named Mark Lester. He would go on to play "Oliver" in the award-winning film of the same name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I enjoy Francois Truffaut's films. I find him to be a genius, but a much different brand of genius...his writing and his directing lend a simplicity and freshness to that which he takes on.I did not like this film.One problem you do run into as a film maker is the possibility that your film may not live up to the original work. This film did not. Truffaut's simplicity and directness doesn't work for this story. This story is much more dynamic...and the fact that he didn't write it doesn't help. The ending was changed, made it happy by tying up loose ends from the book...this contrasts his general style in so many ways.And as for the Wizard of Oz...that situation is much different, because the film version of Wizard of Oz, though different, was also masterful. This film is not masterful.The Wizard of Oz was its own entity...cutting and chopping and creating something new. 451 essentially tries to stay with the book...but disappointingly falls short through minor changes and inappropriate direction, such as the readdition of Clarisse to the ending (making the story more insular and less universal), and again that direct, simplistic style for such a dynamic story.More appropriate than Truffaut would have been a Polanski type, unafraid of abstraction (however, usually Truffaut held effectively to his postmodernist-anticipation in the beginning) and knowledgeable of appropriate visuals.So, in regards to other comment...I guess I disagree.(and the book ain't that special? geeeeeez....)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huxley, Bradbury, Orwell... all of them wrote stories in which they prophesied about a future world: the culture is forbidden and punished in those future worlds, for they're the biggest threaten for the governors and the riches (they feel more free to do their dirty jobs if people are ignorant). In this Bradbury's story that Truffaut adapted books are the most dangerous artifacts in the world: you shall not read, you shall not write... you shall not think!. There ain't anything more desolating than the view of books burning. In this future the firemen do not fight the fire, they burn books, that's their main task.OK, the aesthetic wasn't brilliant enough, and there's no doubt that special effects were not Truffaut's specialty, but the message remains. This movie is more necessary today than 40 years ago, for we're too close to that future world ruled by a Big Brother. Otherwise, it is pretty obvious how much Hitchcock influenced Truffaut, the shadow of the English director is palpable in many sequences.A classic movie.*My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical and boring Truffaut film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start saying that i have nothing against François Truffaut. Honestly, i really dislike his works,they are way too boring. However,when it comes to films, i can open a exception to like it(or try to) even when the work is insufferably boring IF it,of course, is a very well made one. Yes, i do appreciate when a director put a lot of effort in his works. And about Truffaut, it's really admirable his dedication here in Fahrenheit 451. But despite that, truth being said now: what a boring and uninteresting film. I tried to like it with all of my heart, but i really couldn't. The script is terrible: There is no conflict at all, it'sextremely slow paced,it has a lot of sequences, which has a lot of interminable dialogues and a great amount of pointless scenes.But obviously, 'Fahrenheit' has it's strengths. The acting is good, i can't deny that. Oskar Werner in the lead role is a bit impressive. The film, in a 'overall' context, as i already mentioned, is very well-made. Cool special effects, at least for the time of it's release. And notably, it has a severe critic against the society, among other few interesting ideas explored into the film.Overall, is a well intentioned film, with a few good ideas, but extremely hard to sit through. Not recommended, unless if you are into this 'French new wave'. 6.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie -- like the novel -- glorifies the written word over life and free thought. After checking some scenes with the novel, I was quite surprised at how faithful the director was to the novel. The violence which the protagonist displays by burning a person as opposed to the books is highly ironic and speaks volumes as to the author's priorities. There is no doubt that the director is among the greatest in his field. The same is true of the novelist. The acting is fantastic as are most other aspects of the movie. The message is truly lost on both of them. It can't be true that the exact written word is more important than the ideas behind them. Being bound to read is just as limiting (if not more so) than being forced not to read. And the thought of a sub-culture of individuals who do nothing but repeat novels word for word for their entire lives is stifling to the development of new ideas.</fullReview>

Some countries in the western world is approaching this kind of censorship and drugs people down by giving them mind-numbing television, advocates uniformity and feeds them pills for all their problems so its kind of actual today.I love the style of this. The directing is strong and the mood is well created. Music by Bernard Herrmann reminded me in bits of his score for 'Psycho', but don't worry, its original and very very good - I don't usually like orchestra music for films, but Herrmann pulls it off most of the time. This here is one of the best I have heard.I don't know what film-stock they use to produce such colors, it seems the industry discarded it during the 70s, and I cant see why they did because its much more beautiful than what it was replaced with. Its similar to '2001' in style, but as far as sci-fi goes, 'Fahrenheit 451' uses modern architecture as its setting. That is a Le Corbousier like building (and I think I saw one of his chaiselons as well) and one of those monorails where the train is hanging. This is quite amusing I think as its not that uncommon today.. And the TV-wall is very similar to the plasma TVs of today. Else the strong red backgrounds fits the tight enforcement of the firemen.</fullReview>

Wonder what the Government of the day would have made of Harry Potter?However, I digress! Inarguably bereft of interesting characters (except the aforementioned Miss Zhivago!) this film is image-driven and not up there for the SIMPSONS set! The fact that technology has outstripped the need for literary passion - no need now to have walking zombie-like people-books when you can burn the works of Chairman Mao on to your neighbor's cd!....renders, conceptually at least, much of the premise to be archaic.Osker Werner, one of the least charismatic actors to grace the big screen (although he lent much to SHIP OF FOOLS) is an arguably appropriate choice as Montag, the fireman with a conscience and a thirst for banned literature.Rumored to be up for remaking this year by none other than Mel Gibson's ICON film company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many movies about the future where everything seems a million times different than they are today. This movie is one of them, but it's one that actually seems reasonable. The changes aren't that drastic and it's really about a corrupt government that condemns owning and reading books. The futuristic, evil government reminds me of Escape from New York and LA, but it is better here. It plays as the enemy just like it did in those films, but here the main character starts out as one of them. So the enemys are his friends and don't know that he has betrayed the cause. It makes for an interesting plot that is occasionally slow, but definately worthwhile. The idea that firemen start fires and don't put them out is really cool. This movie is good for it's unique vision and interesting society. The story about the man going from opposition to supporter of books is good too. Much better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A world without books. Firemen knockin' at your door and burning the books. People forced to watch television instead. Sounds like a dream come true for some, I would think. But I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea in the end. I mean, even I read the occasional recreational book every now and then.Fahrenheit 451 covers a weird subject. A society without rich human emotion, full of narcissistic individuals who think that true happiness only comes from absolute conformity and by being like everyone else. This is hardly groundbreaking stuff here. Do the firemen look like Nazi's? The salutes also indicated a sort of retreat to that militarism.I simply didn't find this film to be all that involving, somehow very emotionally detached. Maybe that was the point, but then I didn't like it. Also, the subject matter never grabbed me. I get the point about the written word being a living figure and opening a much richer world to the reader than television can ever do. In some instances I thought that point got across quite effectively. It would have been nice to have something more going on, like see more of Julie Christie's rebel character. (I did however like the fact that conformist Christie made love to Werner because of ingesting some pills, very strong point). It's frustrating to me that the protagonist is not very likable and a very dull Oskar Werner portrays him with little enthusiasm. Also the ending, I didn't like it that much. Felt it was sort of cheap.On the whole, I thought this was an agreeable film but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reproducing some parts of a book doesn't make a movie just like that. The book is very good, even if the premises (that a society would be able to survive without books) are wrong. It's simply well written. I've even read the notes of the author after I finished the book... The movie tries to represent some parts of the book but stops short of giving birth to art, to something new. The acting is not bright and the atmosphere doesn't excel either. Compared to Brazil, another film with a dark view of the future, Fahrenheit 451 is less bold and takes fewer chances to makes mistakes, but is too plain. Brazil succeeds in creating an atmosphere where you get a bit close to the feeling of living in a totalitary state. The movie is not exactly bad, but it's not good either. To take only the movie into consideration, I'd say watch it, but because there's the book, I say don't. Read the real thing instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the book exceptionally great.I found the movie a big disappointment... Esthetically speaking, it's ugly. All what's in the book could have paved way for nice photography. It would not have harmed the movie. Instead, I had the impression of watching a B-series science fiction film. The book would have deserved better.I know that some people object that the style was intentional on part of the filmmaker. Well, the result is something that aged quickly and seems ridiculous now.Read the book, it has not aged ! This movie should not be an excuse for not reading an exceptional work of art...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not too shabby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film failed to portray the message of the book, but that does not mean it doesn't have a message--it does. Basically, freedom is valuable, however, it can easily be taken away. Though the futuristic look of the film looks dated, I have to admit that some of the things in the film look all too familiar. The television, for example, hanging from Montag's wall looks eerily like the new plasma screen tvs you see in the stores. And the hanging mono rail is now not too far fetched either. Having Montag speak with a German accent was done on purpose, but I don't know if the meaning of it has been successfully carried through time. Upon seeing the film, I thought it was stereotypical that he should be speaking like that and be associated with burning books. Then I thought of redemption, and the fact that in the film he starts to read, but I still find it stereotypical. Having to go on the other side of the tracks to get to freedom was interesting, where there is a sort of vagabond reader's circle. That too was a nice touch, and having filmed it in the fall with the leaves falling, etc, added much needed "natural" aesthetics to the film.</fullReview>

They missed out Montag barfing, Montag meeting Faber, The white cartoon clowns, Chief Beaty coming into Montag's house, Granger, and the mechanical hounds. I was amazed at the beginning of the film that the credits were read, than shown. I was surprised at the "The End" card. I was expecting it would be read, but it was shown. I saw a scene from FAIRLY ODDPARENTS episode, "Fool's Day out", where AJ's papers about his life were burning. It reminded me about that story. Anyone who watched the film or read the book will laugh (so hard). I heard a remake is coming out in 2004. I don't know who will be the star in this picture, but I bet the visiual effects will be done by something like ILM, or Digital Domain, or Rhythem and Hues, or Sony Imageworks. And for the white cartoon clowns scene, why not let it be done by Craig POWERPUFF GIRLS McCracken, Butch FAIRLY ODDPARENTS Hartman, Gennedy DEXTER"S LABORATORY Tratrovsky, Van JOHHNY BRAVO Partible, or David COW AND CHICKEN Feiss. The picture is very interesting. At that time my father saw that film when he was 10. Now I can't wait to see the 2004 remake. Plus I heard that one of Ray Bradbury's stories will be adapted to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Book Adaptation EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am truly baffled at any review of this movie that is even remotely positive. There is NOTHING good about this movie. As a fan of Ray Bradbury's classic, I cringe at every attempt the movie makes to bring this story to the screen. Even worse are all the "artistic" changes that the movie tries to make. First of all, why change Mildred's name to Linda. Just one example of the arbitrary and completely ineffective changes from the book. And then the director decides to cast the same actress as both Mildred and Clarisse, even though they are totally different ages. Instead of a Mechanical Hound, we have a pole. The "wall-size" TV screens are laughably small. On top of this, the acting is stilted, and the dialogue is cheesy and forced. As I watched, I found myself groaning painfully, almost minute by minute, at the wooden acting, the flat writing, and the confused and misguided decisions of the director, whom I just refuse to name because of the butchering he did to this masterpiece. For all of those who had good things to say about this movie, or who somehow, inexplicably, raved about this joke of an adaptation, I have to ask: Did you even read the book? Fahrenheit 451 is perhaps my favorite novel and one that I feel gets more important with age, and watching this movie was a frustrating and disheartening experience, and I can only hope that a remake can get closer to the mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in need of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of the greatness which Francois Truffaut accomplished during his career, this was always kind of a drag. It probably would have been better if he made this film in French, capturing his abilities to tie in dialogue and performance.Sadly, the film is a bit awkward, and is need of a tune-up, especially in the wake of today's world summit. Political correctness is shackling what we can say and our ability to make critiques of common culture. Nothing can be said without offending some minute minority, which is what began the downfall of society in the book. Personally, I don't think we're far off from what Ray Bradbury depicted in his future. Simply look at most movie reviewers these days, and you'll see how hollow their reviews typically come off. Hopefully, this future will exist long after I'm dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This sort of gibberish could turn a man to madness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fahrenheit 451 is a movie that fails to achieve it's potential, mainly due to a single flaw: narrative tension.Put simply, there isn't any. Set in a totalitarian state where fireman have evolved into men that burn books, believing them to be harmful to society, this fails to live up to it's promise. Where some "Big Brother" mentality could have worked wonders, we are expected to believe the horror of this future state (represented by a TV that fits in a wall and a monorail) by the fact that people act very politely towards one another. Anton Diffring, fourth in credits order, actually has little to do, and when we do see the firecrew in action - flying overhead on jet packs - the effect used to achieve this is so dated it produces laughter rather than fear. The remainder of this "futuristic" world is created using minimalist location work with low-grade housing; a technique which immediately conjures up comparisons with Le Proc?s and A Clockwork Orange. The comparisons aren't favourable. Science fiction is largely incidental. There is a preponderance with pills, and Montag's wife becomes randy after having her entire blood supply replaced. (?Cos it was only a myth when they said it happened to Keith Richards).As an allegory, it too falls short. The idea of book burning is, of course, directly related to the Nazi regime, and there are even one or two chest-slapping salutes in the piece. But the message has no great relevance to a contemporary audience, and the war had been over for 17 years when this film was finally screened. Points are also lost by using cultural snobbery against television. Rather than suggesting it could be a viable cultural outlet if used correctly, Fahrenheit 451 also bites the hand that feeds it by implying that visual communications are wrong. (Wonder what they'd make of the Internet?) This is ironic as Fahrenheit 451 works well as a novel, but is terrible as a film. François Truffaut, writer and director of the lauded Jules et Jim, is here static, and that's another problem. The European style of the often-rigid camerawork clashes with the full-blown pomp of the English incidental music.Then there's the stylised, datedly stiff acting. Oskar Werner is sympathetic as Montag (a name we hear mentioned multiple times throughout the film - Cyril Cusack can't resist calling it him at the end of virtually every sentence), but the majority of the cast are knowingly stagy. Montag's rejection of the old values by returning to reading is something that would be a wonderful characterisation on paper, but seeing Werner reading from David Copperfield is hardly likely to set audiences on fire. (Bad pun, sorry). What the film needs to shake it up (apart from being about half an hour shorter) is some genuine confrontation. But there isn't any. We see TV clips of the firemen cutting peoples' hair (ooh, scary!) and the occasional book burning, but that's about it. When we see the firemen through Montag's eyes they are affable and disaffected.There are two nice touches, both of which allude to the film's origins. One is where a "book person" - an undercover group of rebels who each memorise a book - claims he has memorised Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles. There's another when the fire chief holds up a copy of Mein Kampf to be burnt. But two nice moments in a film do not make a good movie. Take the film's message home with you. Next time the leadenly-paced Fahrenheit 451 comes on TV, switch it off - and read the book instead...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever look forward to FAHRENHEIT 451, stop right where you are and listen. FAHRENHEIT 451 is too slow moving, too cerebral and is very hard to get into. Any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie. The vehicle that the 451 unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see. But FAHRENHEIT only gets away with flash for only so long. The plot, the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting, minus Montag, whom Oskar Werner plays very well. Some situations are positively screwed up. The moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some. FAHRENHEIT 451 may be considered a classic to some, but without a remake quick, this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater.In the future, the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch TV and take drugs. Miserable firefighter Montag, set for a promotion in the 451 book burning unit, takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book. His life then goes upside-down from there.What makes FAHRENHEIT 451 so infamous is much like why BLADE RUNNER is considered a cult classic to some. The idea of its future are so true to real life it is unbelievable. Both movies still are atrocious. And FAHRENHEIT 's dated moments shows terribly. The incident when the cops arrest the man for having long hair, plays much on the hippie likeness that long hair was rebellious. There is never much going for FAHRENHEIT 451 from the start, and its boring, brooding nature buries it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really, really bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my teens, this was one of a handful of negative utopias that had my interest. After viewing this movie again today, I was struck by what a profoundly literal, low-grade concept it is for the basis of a culture, even as a device to investigate totalitarianism and book-burning; and what a flimsy, lonely unpromising idea it is for both a book and a movie. The premise lacks supporting ideas, quickly becoming monomaniacal and risible. 1984 and Brave New World both have much more far-reaching premises. I seriously doubt you can make a decent movie out of the book (Good luck remake!). Bradbury achieved second tier fame; he's someone you have to find your way to because his ideas and his exploration of them are not especially momentous.It's not clear if Oskar Werner is impossibly dull as the protagonist, or if he's part of Truffaut's bigger vision of a dull film. In a bit of a casting accident, his face resembles a young William F. Buckley; which makes his efforts to destroy people's hidden caches of books very odd. Casting Julie Christie in two roles is a bad idea, producing no frisson.How on earth did Truffaut find his way to (and conclude he would make) such an unimportant book into a film? It is a garish, dumb-looking film with acres of intellectual emptiness. I did not need to see Truffaut move on from something as thoughtful and revolutionary as The 400 Blows to a silly, big budget piece of wheezing deflation like this. As Hitchcock established, it often takes a very interestign artist to make a movie this bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book at least a hundreds times, serving as the basis of my writing world (even if for the moment, none of my 4 novels had been printed... yet) and when I heard there was a movie version I told to myself, "I must see it one day"...Well, I think I should have avoid seeing such a piece of c..p and s...t ! Really, nothing happens like in the book : First, they change th name of Montag's wife from Mildred to Linda... figure why this silly change.Second, they decided to put Julie Christie in both roles of Linda and Clarisse, making not clear who is who (long hair, short hair didn't work to me or to Bradbury himself).Third, no mechanical hound : I don't believe they didn't have the budget to do something close to it, cause you see four stupid guys flying after Montag) and Faber is also absent... ... so, no mechanical hound, no Faber and no Clarisse (Ray Bradbury himself saw this with sorrow, although he "love" this... movie), is like Hamlet without the Ghost, Horatio and Hamlet.Forth, Françoise Truffault is a very BAD director : he used to be a very heavy movie critic but later, he became a very very s...y director and in this movie you can feel he's more worried to make clin d'oeils (references) to his old movie "Les 400 coups" instead of adapting the book Farenheit 451 ! Fifth, the acting very deceiving... take them all away ! Specially Wagner, horrible as Montag ! Sixth, the futuristic idea : if you read the book, society must be happy, having fun all the time in order to avoid thinking ; here in the movie, they did the contrary... notice that Clarisse says to Montag she loves to have fun with her students...... actually, Clarisse was no teacher in the book, she was a student and she didn't like to have fun (as the others) but to thiink ! Read the book ! Clarissse was declared antisocial cause she love to think instead of having fun !!! Seventh, where's the atomic bombing over Chicago ? I mean, the idea (on the book) was : a war was to be declared and the city is destroyed, Montag finally remembered when he first met Mildred and knew she died in the bombing and as for the others, Faber took a bus before, Clarisse died earlier and Montag became an outlaw, but none of the real stuff happens in this so called movie.By the way : changing Chigago to London... not sure about the result !OK... I see many people like it (and I wonder how... maybe they didn't read the book) and I must confess, only the beginning is good : The credits are announced marking the reality of the story (reading is forbidden) The first sequence, the Salamander (if you read the book, that's the nickname of the fireman's car) goes to burn with an excellent ground music...... and that's it, nothing more ! The rest of the movie is the total deception I've already described.Good to be back in your commentaries ! Thanks and Don't let me be misunderstood !!!PS My personal advice, don't see this movie !!!</fullReview>

I dislike the films in which characters talk to each other to explain the plot to the viewers. Some tense music is out of place because nothing serious is happening. Some scenes fade to black too fast and there is a general feel of sloppy flow in the story. Most dialogues sound silly to me, and it's not a problem of being dated. Anton Diffring is a great actor (just his evil stare is great), but his character, which promises to be a real threat to Montag, never develops enough (not his fault, but the script's). Roeg nearly saves the day doing a fantastic job as always, conveying a feeling of modern isolation/desolation in an undetermined future. Christie, gorgeous as always. After some time I'll give it a second chance though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly disappointing adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a film is in trouble when the 30 min mark comes around and you have yet to find yourself drawn in, nor have any feelings for any of the characters. This film, which should have worked on so many levels is one of those failures.Perhaps its because this was Truffaut's first (and only) all English speaking film. Or maybe it was the stone face deliverance of Oskar Werner's performance of Montag. Whatever the culprits might be this is a very hard film to watch. With all of the elements of this film brought together you find that it lacks any compelling or believable conflicts for the characters which in turn makes the story uninteresting and forgettable. Even the interaction of the characters within their own environment comes across fake and awkward, as if the actors had no idea how things in this world were meant to run. There is an underlying tension that seems to run through the film that has nothing to do with the story, more with the production itself. And this is what kills the entertainment.The novel stands out as one of Bradbury's finest achievements so it is unfortunate that the production team chosen for the project wasn't selected with the same care. I would suggest everyone to wait for Frank Darabont's version and see if he was able to make any improvements.</fullReview>

That they would also burn books didn't sit well with me. Their "self preservation" argument, that the government doesn't bother them because of their impeccable lawfulness, doesn't hold water. If the book burning government is indeed attempting to, as the film implies, rid the world of history, it would be likely that they would also "burn" the book people as well. Why should they let them be? Out of sight, out of mind? If so, why not keep the paper copies (well hidden, if necessary)? Would the firemen actually trek into the "wilderness" to destroy books?Also, I was rather bothered by the reading ability of Montag (and others). From where would they have learned it? Had only the captain been able to read, I would have played it off as due to his age. But Montag didn't strike me as having grown up with reading material about...I can only hope a remake is on the way that handles the subject with a bit more care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burnt out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was watching Steven Spielberg's MINORITY REPORT, I was totally taken in by the story. Until.... At one point it is mentioned that the police had to read someone their Miranda rights. The story is set in 2055 America and the police regularly arrest, sentence and incarcerate individuals, without any sort of due process, for crimes that have yet to be committed, based solely on psychic predictions -- yet, actual suspects of actual crimes are still read their Miranda rights! A totalitarian police state with civil liberties? At that point the film's fragile facade of credibility shattered and I could not accept the rest of the film. The elaborate story just fell apart.Science fiction is like that: you have to be willing to give it a wide swath in order to accept its sometimes outrageous themes and ideas, but it is a frail compromise. When the real word contradicts the fantasy of the sci-fi, it is difficult to be forgiving. I mention this in regard to Francois Truffaut's FAHRENHEIT 451 because what we know about the real world just doesn't jive with the cautionary tale that the film concocts.Okay, in all fairness, FAHRENHEIT 451 is not really sci-fi in narrative, but much like "The Twilight Zone," it exists in the realm of sci-fi as far as tone and intent. It has that smug intellectual air of superiority that most sci-fi pointedly wears. Indeed, the worse the science fiction, the more arrogantly condescending the material seems to be. Bad sci-fi, even if it is allegorical like FAHRENHEIT 451, comes off as being less an explosion of ideas and insights, then a high-toned lecture. Good sci-fi is a thoughtful journey; bad sci-fi is a self-righteous guilt trip.Truffaut's film takes place in one of those futures that looks remarkably like the present (circa 1966) -- which quickly looks like the past. Obviously the film had a small budget and little attempt was made to jazz it up. That's okay, you can accept the story as taking place in an alternate universe. But within that alternate universe, the logic falters. The story takes place in a society where all books have been banned and government sends out "firemen" whose job is to find and burn books. Books, the film argues, creates emotions in readers and that makes the masses hard to control. Instead, the people are given tediously vapid television programming and a selection of drugs designed to placate them into obedience. (Bored, drug addicted couch potatoes are presumably less of a threat to order than educated bookworms.) Having not read Ray Bradbury's original 1950s story that inspired this movie, I can only say this about the movie: The premise of the movie is utterly sophomoric. This is a dumb movie, it makes no sense, even on an allegorical level.The reality is that power goes to those who control the media, not to those who try to destroy the media. They burned books in Nazi Germany and in other totalitarian states, but the point was not to silence all thought, but to force on the populous a specific thought. Censoring everything accomplishes nothing -- and, in any case, is impossible. Destroying all books makes no sense; though controlling totally what books are acceptable, creating the illusion of a sort of freedom, such as in China or the former USSR or parts of the Third World, is a tangible and realistic threat to a healthy civilization. Heck, the censorship battle goes on continuously in the United States with conservatives trying to solidify moral standards and liberals trying to promote political correctness.But even if you accept the notion that FAHRENHEIT's world is one where books apparently have been banned for decades, then you have to ask why so many people still seem to be able to read? And how were they taught to read if they didn't have books? And how does the government itself codify its laws and record its business if it isn't all kept in some sort of book form? Language is what binds a society together and the written word is language at its most effective and convenient. Freedom can't exist without the written word; but then again, neither can oppression. The story wants it both ways: Its make-believe society is made up of people who are ignorant, yet supposedly literate, and are controlled by a state that is a highly efficient and sophisticated fascist government, yet, by logic, must be made up of people who are illiterate, yet still are not ignorant.I understand the message the film so clumsily tries to get across. This society isn't denied all intelligence, only that which is "intellectual," i.e., that of superior minds (like Bradbury's and Truffaut's?), of which books are only a symbolic representation. What the story feels is threatened is not education, but intellect -- higher, complex thinking which the film seems to feel is threatened by everyday pragmatism. The underlying notion in films like FAHRENHEIT 451 is that the powers that control society have a paranoid fear of those with superior intellect, yet the stories themselves seem to suggest just the opposite: Progressive thinkers, or at least those who think their thoughts are progressive, have a paranoid fear of being controlled by government, or more specifically, society. There is a certain perverse elitism inherent in such works.This type of tale would probably have worked as an episode of the aforementioned "Twilight Zone." Told in a punchy half-hour format, paring it down to a bare-bones what-if fantasy, the story would not give one the opportunity to question either the logic of the story or the motives of the storytellers. As is, FAHRENHEIT 451 plods along dramatically and pontificates needlessly. You've got to appreciate the sincerity of FAHRENHEIT 451's message, but even so the film amounts to little more than a whimsical idea that is too frail to withstand the very type of intellectual thought that the story itself defends.</fullReview>

In the movie,the parlor walls weren't as they were let on to be in the book. It was said Montag had 3 covering 3 of his walls. In the movie, he only has one and it doesn't even cover up the whole wall. I do, however, like the fire truck and the music chosen for when they are driving to a house that has books.All in all I think this movie is pretty good for something made in the 60's.</fullReview>

This movie guts key characters, events, dialogue and symbols from the book, electing to add such superfluous events as Montag and his wife making eyes at each other on their bed.This film indicated to me the most rudimentary grasp of the story on the part of the writers and director.Bad pacing, mediocre acting, and a "tell, don't show" mentality make this a poor representation of Bradbury's art."Look, we're so artsy we're going to show the wind flipping pages in a book of Dali paintings for 30 seconds." I hope the next group to remake this does a better job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you want to burn this book/movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big sci-fi fan and reader, having read all the major works of all the major authors, I can safely say the only books that should be burned are those of Ray Bradbury. And this movie perfectly captures the feeling of sheer drivel one got from the book itself. Just as the book painfully stretches a rather lame short story idea into a novel, so the movie drags on interminably with nothing but thoughtful, worried looks and pomposity to carry it along. You'll have to either be heavily sedated or strapped down to weather the whole thing in one sitting.To laud this work is to insult all those authors who actually spent some time thinking before writing about their dystopia. I know the poets and lit majors, who have no appreciation for plausibility or plots, swoon all over Bradbury's works, but to me science fiction should not throw logic and ideas to the wind just to help create a mood or be "thought provoking". Dystopias are the most enjoyable branch of science fiction -- you are a thousand times better off reading/watching A Clockwork Orange or Requiem for a Dream, which are both in the top five best movies of all time, and incidentally most egregious oversights for best picture Oscar as well (1971, 2000).I give it +2 for inspired directing in the face of miserable material, +1 each for Werner and Christie's perfect (i.e. wooden) performances, again, trying to salvage something in the absence of any real material. That brings me to 4 out of 10, and I am being generous here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Bradbury's book about a bleak future in which books are banned and firemen start fires is a genuine classic which is rightfully considered part of the science fiction canon.Anybody who has read the book will be acutely chagrined by this film adaption. As I have read the book, I was hoping that the film would bring the book to life and inspire my film-student friend.As it is, the film never really catches fire. There is not a spark of originality or inspiration in the film. The actors are wooden and it is they, not the books, that deserve to be sent to the pyre. Watching the film extinguished any desire my friend might have had to actually read Ray Bradbury.If Stanley Kubrick had done this movie, the film version of Fahrenheit 451 would have taken its place in the pantheon of great books made into even greater films, including 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.As it is, the film looks as if someone had told François Truffaut about the book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. After hearing a one-minute synopsis, François Truffaut jumps up and says "That gives me an idea for a movie!"In short, instead of a "Gospel of Light," we end up with the film equivalent of an "Epistle of Straw." It is as if he had heard a faint tingling of the gospel, but not the whole symphony.The result is "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a dull experience, watching funky 60's French monorails, horror hair and indiscriminate Euro-talent sleepwalk through an underwritten version of an overwritten book. Bradbury's gushing proto-beat stream of self-consciousness fed through Truffaut's primary-colour non-style looks like the Magic Roundabout without the magic during a traffic jam.Julie Christie pulls off the remarkable feat of failing to act twice in the same film. Oskar the German Bloke behaves like Keanu Reeves without the animation. But special mention must go to Truffaut who fails to point the camera in the direction of a story, a real idea or even the right colour half the time.Bradbury says the book is a critique of the effects of TV, not censorship, as the movie suggests. Ironically, the book was indeed published in later editions without the words'hell' and 'damn'. An equivalent recompense would have been to censor the entire film, apart from the bit they filmed backwards when he goes up the pole. I grunted. You? Truffaut should stick to abasing himself before creeps like Hitchcock and making wolf-boy movies nobody apart from Mowgli can sit through. This movie lacks even the gauche enthusiasm he brought to his vague magazine ramblings about Godard's film grammar (equally unwatchable/readable). Bradbury's book makes you cringe enough as it is, because of his DNA-strings of adverbs and nascent paedophilia, but Franny does the same job without the metal dog, without any talent and without even speaking the language (saved him from the adverbs, then.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit outdated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut's movie is about a very interesting and dark future where books are forbidden, because (in the opinion of the government) they have a very bad effect on the behavior and mentality of the people. But one of the firemen, whose job is the burning of the books, begin to read novels and will be an enemy of the system. I read Bradbury's novel a long time ago and I don't remember it exactly, but it was much butter than the movie. However, there aren't really great problems with Truffaut's film, but I think today it's very outdated. The set is silly, the fire truck is absolutely ridiculous (I even don't mention the flying cops upon the swam), and the whole technical design is very old-fashioned. Besides I didn't like the optimist happy ending. The book-men-idea is great and it's fine, that Montag finds his own small world, where he can be one of the saviors of the written history and the culture of the humanity, but it's too much... This ending is bad manners to the story about the disaffected world, and how I can remember Bradbury's book has an other ending which was much better. I think, this is the problem of the man who rebells against the system in an utopia like 1984 or Brand New World. They (and Fahrenheit 451 too) are about a dark, totalitarian future, where maybe a single man can rebel, but has absolutely no chance to win: he MUST fall. I think this is the essence, the message of these stories: the menacing picture of a cold world without humanity and emotions, and you can't fight war against a society like this. There is no hope. But there is hope in this movie. It's good and bad at the same time. Good, because it's interesting, that one of the characters speaks at the end about the periodicity of the world: now books are forbidden, but in the future there will be presses again, people will read, and AFTER THAT maybe will come another dark age and so forth... This is nice, because it's about the hope and the endless fight of the mankind for being human. But bad, because it understates the absolutely, oppressive power of these terrific societies. I wrote that this movie is very outdated, and it's true, but from an other point of view it has overtaken his own age: There is a very hard, satiric media critic in Fahrenheit 451. Television makes people senseless, dump puppets (like Montag's wife, whose life is filled up with the "Family") and of course at the same time manipulate them (Montag's stagy death on the news) So this movie is a bit dusty for me, it has good and bad sides too, but I think it deserves a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to have been one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The main character, Montag has the most annoying German accent I've encountered, and the whole movie was just plain boring. The book was much better, and even that sucked at best. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It is too foreign and too outdated for purely American tastes such as mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so, the book is incredible, and this movie is one of the worst movies ever. thats not just because its from '66, but it makes no sense. this director must have swallowed sum of MILDRED'S (not Linda)pills when he was directing this. the whole minute when it shows people touching themselves, rounding out with MILDRED massaging her woman-parts? WHAT THE CRAP! ARGH! seriously, has anybody else seen this movie? it would have put me to sleep if i wasn't so busy thinking to myself how incredibly bad it was. not only all that, but half the time they spoke too fast for anyone to understand their crazy accents. was that British or German coming out of guy montags mouth? this is like gigli. get it. laugh at it. rave about it. give it back. end of discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good example of tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>some adaptations take the original works, and push them into places the book did not, and in doing so, create a new story which adds to the original concepts and creates a genuine piece of art. and then there are adapatations like this. the director and the producer did not want to make a science fiction film, so naturally they decided to make bradbury's fahrenheit 451 into a film. bradbury himself has stated that it is his only science fiction book, and that element is so important to the genesis of the ideas, the characters, and the plot, that to remove it...well this film shows what happens when you remove it. it becomes a pointless waste of time, and worse, it becomes a waste of one of the most beautiful books ever written. a stunningly subtle book, that would translate perfectly to the screen, here it is mutilated and turned into what would nowadays be called "hollywood crap". pointless romances and side stories that drown and demolish the narrative and its philosophical/sociological drive. in the making of, it is made quite clear that trauffut did not want to make a sci-fi film, instead he wanted to make a hitchcockian film. so he destroyed this piece of art to badly shove his own shoddy vision into our laps. gee, thanks. overly long and pointless thanks to the loss of structure and intelligence. junk. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.....THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does NOT under any circumstances do any justice to the great book upon which it is based. The story is adapted poorly, Oskar Werner's acting is stiff and overdone at best, and I found it annoying that Guy Montag is known simply as "Montag." Also, I find it hard to believe that Truffaut directed this, especially since he is considered by many to be France's equivalent to Fellini or Kurosawa. I met Ray Bradbury at a talk he gave in my Southern California town a few years back, and he agreed that the movie was terrible and that he himself was disappointed by it--if that isn't a strong case against it, I don't know what is. When I met Mr. Bradbury, he said that Mel Gibson would be directing it, and I was very excited, since I had just seen "Braveheart" not long before. But apparently, his studio ICON Pictures is the one releasing it, and it will in fact be directed by Frank Darabont. This is great news since Darabont has done EXCELLENT film adaptations for the Stephen King novels "The Green Mile" and of course, "The Shawshank Redemption," (which was actually a novella).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this film it was on "Moviedrome" on BBC2, the presenter(who had taken over from Alex Cox) some Scottish bloke, gave it an excellent rating and it's unusual description appealed to me. As I watched, I wondered where the film was going, a world where books are banned, and people are encouraged to only watch television, I was impressed by the acting but nothing else, very slow, nothing that would keep you interested except the fact the presenter from "moviedrome" said it had the most beautiful ending to a film he ever saw, I soldiered on, bored wishing for the end to come, and when it did there was nothing beautiful about it.</fullReview>
