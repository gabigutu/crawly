		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's "Psycho" however, gives me pause. Why? I wonder. A shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics. The color was jarring, the performances, atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was it? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any "The Hours" for her, "The Minutes" maybe. So, here I am, bad mouthing the work of one of my idols. The crashing question remains: Why, Mr. Van Sant? Maybe, in the words of President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid that's no excuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shot For Shot....... Except</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius. Audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly.That's why this re-make does not work, even a little bit, in spite of trying to be an exact copy. Whereas Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable as one. He lacks the frail look of Perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well, at least in this role (honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as Anthony Perkins?). While it was a pointless re-make to begin with, the miscasting of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely.As a side note, I feel that Hollywood's propensity for re-making great movies because 'young' people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. As for viewers who can't watch black and white - it's their loss. Hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention. When they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better. With the background muted, the story and performances are that much more front and center. And in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so, until you compare it to the original ? then it's poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marion Crane steals $400,000 and is escaping to meet her boyfriend. When she gets tired during a stormy night she stops at the Bates motel. When she goes missing her sister, boyfriend and a private detective start to look for her. However the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother is a place of many secrets.Remakes are regular things nowadays, but carbon copies are rare. This is a lift in terms of dialogue, shots almost everything at times. The big question is why? As a film in its own right it's not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison (despite the colour!). Why did we need this ? sure on some level it may reach those who haven't seen the original and don't want to watch an 'old' film. But really ? why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 1991?It's not bad ? it's poor a poor relation of the original. In the UK we often get 50th anniversary etc re-releases of old films nationwide (admittedly not in all cinemas), in fact Psycho was out a few years ago. So the idea that a cheap copy is good because it'll help open it up to new audiences.The cast are all OK ? until you watch the original. Then Vaughn stands out as doing a poor imitation, Heche is nowhere near Leigh and Julianne Moore has too much 'strong woman' baggage from other roles to do well. Admittedly the all-star cast gives weight to the roles that were relatively minor ? Macy, Mortensen, Forster, James LeGros, Philip Baker Hall etc ? although really the question is why they all queued up to be in this toss!Overall it's so-so as a film. However when you compare it to the original it's really a poor show and, because it's a carbon copy, you can't help but compare it line for line, scene for scene, actor for actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crime of Profit, Not Passion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word "credit" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, the desperation of a woman facing forty. And Heche doesn't project anxiety the way Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. In the original, the officer asks, "Is there something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. Am I acting as if something were wrong?" The officer hesitates before replying: "Well, frankly, yes." That exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche isn't nervous enough.The worst change, without a doubt, is the substitution of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins is twitchy, bird-like, long-necked, cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. His every move (eating candy corn, with his adam's apple bobbing) and every utterance, the faint laugh, the arid chuckle, is spot on. He just can't be improved upon. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired beefy guy who was just discharged as a Lance Corporal from the U. S. Army. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word "fallacy" because it resembles "phallus".) He could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to UCLA.The direction deserves a few comments. I don't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while peeping in on Anne Heche. I don't OBJECT to it. I wonder why it's there, just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there.And, I suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche is given underwear of all different colors -- green, pink, orange, and -- mango? Is that a color? If so, what the hell color is it? Never mind. The point is that in the original, when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the Phoenix hotel it captures Janet Leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later, after she has stolen the money, we see her in her underwear again -- this time both her slip and bra are black. Tis a small thing, but Hitch's own.At that, the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black-and-white shooting of the original was superb. The color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary, dull, and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of Las Vegas.Most of all, the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. I can remember seeing it in a drive-in in San Diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD -- half-way through the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before.That murder in the shower, in both movies, was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like, "The murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife." I'm not making that up. Well, not entirely. Even here, Van Sant's movie gives us excess. There is more blood and more bare flesh. And where Hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to Marian's blankly open eye, then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face, he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical, giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder, but a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. He practically twirls it on its axis.It won't do to call this a bow to Hitchcock because it's not. It's a pecuniary plundering of Hitchcock's material (already ripped off in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV, and "Psycho: The Beginning Years", and "Come Into My Parlor: Mrs. Bates' Revenge," and "Hand Me That Knife, Would You?: The TRUE story of Norman Bates.") A rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff, a crumenal act if not a criminal one. And that's not to mention the many homages in other films, especially the French, such as the notorious "ocean of boredom" scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much-admired "La Mere de la Nuit." (Maybe I'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when a chicken's guts grind corn, it's a "crumenal" act. I won't go on except to say these gags, shabby as they are, are more fun than the movie.)So who was it made for? I'd have to guess. Kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? Kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie? Chimpanzees?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the worst remake in film history. I have never understood the idea of a remake at all. If a film, like Psycho, is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Gus Van Sant put nothing of himself into this film. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a character as complex as Norman Bates, and I suspect that Vaughn may have wanted to explore them. Instead Van Sant forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of Anthony Perkins. Perkins turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor, no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors (namely William H Macy) have that talent stifled. In the end, Gus Van Sant set out to pay homage to a great film. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't look at this movie in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.That said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn't really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like re-making 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.I'll admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colour)A remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him 'The Stiff' behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.Overall a movie that should be labeled 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. But view original too' The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know curiosity killed the cat, but I simply had to see the remake of Psycho, especially after being on such a Hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work. I've watched the original Psycho though since I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "How do you remake perfection?". I stuck to that as well, but I think I have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing Psycho to a new generation.But this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original Psycho. I know this has been said, but I watched the making of this film, and the director was like "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original"... what's the friggin' point?! OK, but I want to judge this movie on it's own, despite it's insulting blows the original. I mean, the acting wasn't up to par, but honestly, it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own.Watching the making of this film, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, she said "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it's not just that, she really sucked in this role as Marian, she wasn't convincing, not to mention her shower scene really was horrible. Vince Vaughn didn't make... let's just put it this way, the film was horribly miscasted. This was a sin against film and on it's own, this was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation. But to Gus, leave the film making the one's who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING!1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dumb Idea That Didn't Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said "leave it alone." Why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 "Psycho," I don't know. My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialog was the same and the story the same.On one hand, I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film. Yet, if they were going to keep everything the same, why bother when you weren't going to improve on Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast?Did they honestly think Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche, with her short mannish-haircut, is going to be better than Leigh? I don't think so!Yes, the colors were pretty in here but it's the black-and-white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with. It's perfect for the story, not a bunch of greens and pinks! Once again, I guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original.This was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly the Worst Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's. Now, this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character. The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrific events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.The second problem is the lighting. This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the scenes are very brightly lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at NIGHT!Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he does pull off Norman Bate's awkwardness and madness quite well, I don't deny him that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show: the softness. There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character, at least at first, which then fades away once we realize the truth about him. Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!There are a few good aspects of this film. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but, unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because, after seeing this film, that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen. There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow. Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.In other words, my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said. Like everyone else here, I reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My biggest question is "Why did they re-make a classic Hitchcock movie?" It's a "no-win" situation. The original, with Tony Perkins and Jamie Lee's mom (Janet Leigh), is so indelible on our minds that even subconsciously we compare the two. Vince Vaughn is not very believable as Norman Bates. I have yet to find a movie role played by Ann Heche that I like. Her nasal delivery and disingenuous reactions as Marion simply grate on me. Anyone else would have been better. The only character I thought was an improvement was investigator Arbogast played well by William Macy. Even Julliane Moore, as Marion's sister, seemed to have a smirk that announced "I feel silly doing this film." Had this been a completely original film I would probably rate it 5 or 6 for some entertainment. As an inferior re-make, I rate it "4".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the worst remake I've ever seen in my life. Apart from being totally pointless, it was practically a copy of the original. If they had done something differently, maybe I would like it more, but this movie disgusted me and it does not reach even one third of the standard and the suspense of Hitchcock's immortal masterpiece.The new shower murder made me feel sick and Anne Heche was acting like a prostitute the whole time. It seemed like she was flirting with everybody, even the cop who stops her. Vince Vaughn was giggling like an idiot, when it just came naturally for Anthony Perkins. And since when exactly did Norman turn into Master Bates??? Trying to match Anthony Perkins' flawless portrayal of Norman Bates was also pointless. You know from the minute that you see Vince Vaughn that the guy is so obviously deranged. And you probably will have a rough idea of what the ending will be like as well. They're going to haul nutjob back to the nuthouse where he so CLEARLY belongs!!!Lila was way too aggressive, and it seemed like she was always angry. And what was she doing winking at Norman like that? Marion's boyfriend was really annoying and weird, and I don't see how he could wrestle Vince Vaughn to the ground, especially with Vince being so muscular.The actors were a bunch of people basically playing dress-up, and everyone spoke way too fast. And you could also tell from the first second that Norman is crazy. Marion was dumb to stay at the motel.This film is an insult to the Hitchcock name, or at the very least a failed experiment. Gus Van Sant has failed miserably on this one.Do yourself a favour and buy the original where you can enjoy one and a half hours of suspense, scares and screeching violins and don't waste your money on trash like this.God bless Hitchcock!-1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and fey humor the remake doesn't have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, of when to cut away and when to show something, on whether to use a close-up or long shot, on whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to make him frightening, and so forth. The remake has none of these qualities and doesn't even try for them. It's an idiotic exercise that I'm amazed even got released.</fullReview>

Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that one.

		<fullReview>*some possible spoilers*Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay. Many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either, including Julianne Moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film. On top of the atrocious casting, the cinematography is notably shabby, despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene. The one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman, in between the shots of characters being murdered. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway, and in turn made no sense.Overall, this Psycho remake, which could been a decent picture, instead turned out to be a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why remake such a movie to begin with? If you ARE going to remake something, remake something that doesn't work and make it BETTER!Second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had envisioned. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross-dissolved together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. After that, though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, watch this, but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green-lit. Stick to the master's film, not the imitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most disappointing and worst remake of any movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies "Psycho" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, poor acting and poor cast. The best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original.Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. What should have looked realistic in color did not. After the shower scene Norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. Once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color. About acting, perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. In this version, I personally think Vince Vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Norman's role, unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. In the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. Vince Vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart. Again, terrible acting. Same is with Anne Heche. In the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. She was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. That's what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. I don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they've just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. In the shower scene, Janet in the original grips the curtain, turns around and dies after getting stabbed. In the remake, Heche gets stabbed, turns around, then sways the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. Again, terrible acting.There are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. In the scene where Arbogast gets murdered, two scenes blink in between the stabs. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. What on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well. Let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila. And William Macy acted well, that was almost exactly how Arbogast's character should have been played.It is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line, and to try and make it look better than the original. And if anything has happened here according to what I just said, it is directly the opposite. Unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version. Please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not THE best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Refuses to Watch "Old" Movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been suggested in this forum that remakes are partially justified (at least by the studio accounting departments)as good marketing. The "youth" market out there simply won't watch an "old" movie. This runs contrary to my experience. My job puts me in contact with a great many high-school age kids, and they love watching old movies and "vintage" TV shows. Anyone who won't watch an "old" movie probably won't look at "old" paintings, read "old" books or take an interest in their own history. In other words, they're culturally and emotionally retarded, and are of no use to society or themselves.But let's get back to the subject of this ill-advised remake:I've heard a story (probably apocryphal, but worth repeating) that Gus Van Sant was inspired to make this movie, in part, because one of his kids refused to watch a black-and-white movie.If it's true, Gus, here's a little Parenting 101: sit the youth down and say "Hey, in case you don't know who I am, I'm Gus Van Sant, and I know a thing or two about movies. When I say this black and white Hitchcock film is worth watching, it's worth watching."The original consistently makes everyone's Top Ten Lists, although it was ignored by the Oscars. Rent it, watch it, buy the DVD ... and let's just relegate this color remake to "an interesting experiment best not repeated."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all,the whole idea of remaking a classic such as "Psycho" is nothing short of ludicrous.A lot of time and effort was wasted here.I am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original,so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock on their minds.However,the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face to the horror master.This movie is poorly produced,poorly acted,and unnecessary to begin with.The original classic stands well on it's own,even after 40 years.The event of Hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely,but if I were them,I would sleep with one eye open just in case.Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might wanna see this picture just to realize just how good Hitchcock really was. Downright terrible re-make. The reason for the shot-for-shot is for the youngsters who, God forbid, have to watch anything that doesn't resemble a MTV video. Anne Heche only plays the part of a generation X'er, so caught up in herself that she doesn't care about anything...the cop who pulls her over, she acts like it's an inconvenience instead of being one step away from prison. I'm still waiting for Vince Vaughn to act. I've seen him in 3 movies so far and nothing. He should've taken the Ted Bundy persona for this role, the good-looking, nice boy who's monster comes out occasionally. The Anthony Perkins 'Norman' he ain't. (I thought Chad Everette did wonders with his small part, but he's part of that generation of actors who try their hardest.) Macy was good as usual, Moore was really off base as the 'I care, No, I don't' sister. Yes, Virginia, There WAS a Santa Claus and his name was Hitchcock. He brought us well-crafted films...but he lives no more so enjoy the classics he made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Sant to be commended, not condemned...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently finished watching Gus Van Sant's faithful reproduction of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, *Psycho.* This movie was excellent, in nearly all formats, and I am somewhat surprised as to why it did so poorly in both box-office and reviews. The movie is basically a scene-by-scene recreation of the classic, that sticks nearly word-for-word to the original script. The only differences are in the actors and the addition of color. Yet this seems to be enough to determine the two films into Classic and Catastrophe. This makes no sense to me.The acting is very well done in this movie, for the most part. Anne Heche is excellent in her infamous role, as well as William H. Macy in the role of Arbogast. I was somewhat disappointed with Vince Vaughn playing the role of Norman Bates, because he is simply too Hollywood-Glamour-and-Good-Looks to carry off the creepy role of a schizophrenic suffering from a bad case of the Oedipus Complex, but he did do a fine job overall. And anyone who has read Robert Bloch's novel, *Psycho,* knows that not even Anthony Perkins, who fit the role a little better as far as creepiness goes, is what Norman Bates is described as being. Bates is a fat, fidgety, paranoid young man who I think would have been cast better as someone such as Wayne Knight (Newman off of Seinfeld).But overall, the movie is an excellent adaption of the book, both Hitchcock's and Van Sant's. Some, I believe, may view Van Sant's remake of this classic story as disrespectful to the legend, something that should not be tampered with. Yet, I see it more as a tribute. Thank God he did not take any artistic liberties and try to turn the picture into something that it isn't. He realized that it was all laid out before him, a classic film shot with classic cinemetography, and all he had to do was follow those guidelines. Well, the logic seems to be there, but it seems the audience missed the logic.For anyone who enjoyed Hitchcock's version of *Psycho,* I highly recommend viewing Van Sant's, if anything, for the simple compare and contrast of the two. Van Sant has breathed new life into a wonderful movie and given it a fresh, eerie feel that a lot of people seem to miss out on in the older version. The color brings everything to life, and the music (the awesome original score!) alone is enough to take your mind on a frantic and wild ride through the twisted world of Norman Bates. Van Sant is to be commended for his wonderful adaption of Hitchcock's cult classic, not condemned for being reckless with it. Maybe people will one day recognize this, hopefully before Van Sant is deceased. Afterall, Van Gogh sold for pennies, his art considered a disgrace to society with little or no value. I'd like to see what those critics have to say now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll try to make this short and sweet? Overall, the original "Psycho" is obviously better. However, I don't think the remake is nearly as awful as everyone likes to say it is. I mean, how could it be? For the most part, it's a shot-for-shot remake. To say the remake is terrible is kind of like saying the original sucks.Sure, the performances weren't as good in this movie as those in the original film, but most of the action that occurs in the movie was the same.I think there were some good performances in the movie, though, just not Vince Vaughn's. It kind of saddens me in a way to say that, because ordinarily I like Vince Vaughn but he was undeniably weak here, and seemed unsuited for the part.I was a little surprised that when the infamous shower scene happens, after Norman Bates murders Marion, you can see her butthole as she falls out of the shower.I don't remember that in the original? I mean, was this remake necessary? Not really. Most remakes aren't. However, it could've been worse. I think that Rob Zombie's horrible remake of "Halloween" deserves to be bashed far more than this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, Gus Van Sant's Psycho is an interesting exercise - a shot-for-shot remake of Hitchcock's classic, using the same script, music, and fair representations of the set, props etc., only in colour this time. And, like many experiments, it doesn't meet with the success its makers may have hoped for.I can't go along with those who have marked it down to 1 - the strength of the source material alone justifies a more positive reaction than that. Plus, a score of 1 surely intimates that Hitchock's script, set, music, and shot choices were terrible, because they are all here in this version, so there can be no other conclusion. They weren't terrible then, and they're not terrible now. No, a score of 1 is no more than a knee-jerk reaction to someone having the nerve to remake Hitchcock.Where this version fails in the sheer essence of being copied: that fact drains it of any originality, and robs the performers of any opportunity to add anything of themselves to the film. Instead you end up with sterile copies of the classic performances elicited with Hitchcock, and this is a shame because the performers are all good (and Vince Vaughan, who went on to play the same character in a series of increasingly poor comedies, edges perilously close to his own version of creepy).I was going to say that what you end up with is like a painting-by-numbers version of an old master - you can see what made the original a classic, but there is something drastically lacking in the execution. But perhaps a better analogy is that this version is like a reanimated corpse - you can see the person it used to be, but it has no life of its own.I would add a couple of further thoughts: making this film was not a crime, and it hasn't removed Hitchcock's original from the world. It's still out there, folks. And it's far more worth seeing than this.</fullReview>

I have several CDs that include this score, but the recording for this film is the best I've heard. Great fidelity. PSYCHO is one of Hermann's finest scores. It's interesting that it was scored for strings only (no brass, woodwinds, or percussion). I believe the composer was quoted as saying that he wrote it for this one sonority to compliment the black and white photography of the original. I'm not so sure it compliments the color remake as well, but it's still highly effective. Bravo to Danny Elfman and his music staff for a job well done.</fullReview>

This travesty is even worse than I thought it would be, and I set my expectations very low.The acting is appalling, with the exception of William H. Macy as the detective. Anne Heche's take on Marion Crane is so wrongheaded as not to be believed; when she's fleeing Phoenix in the car you want to smack that stupid smirk off her face. And why would Vince Vaughn take on a role so closely associated with Anthony Perkins, who not only played Norman Bates in the original film, but three sequels, too? The biggest surprise in this cast is Julianne Moore, who is usually excellent in any role; here, she looks embarrassed, like she's going through the motions.Universal could have used the money they wasted on this rape of cinema to restore the original 1960 film, or perhaps one of Mr. Hitchcock's lesser known pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a colourization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps a pointless remake, perhaps not, but certainly better than a colourization. This movie is a 99% word-for-word, shot-for-shot, camera-angle-for-camera-angle, set-for-set remake. You're practically watching the same movie, just in colour with today's actors, fashion etc. with one or two little tweaks.So, certainly, if the original movie was well scripted, well directed and had a good story, this translates over to the remake. The question is, is there any point in watching it? That depends on you. How familiar are you with the original? If it's one you've seen a few times and enjoyed, it might be worth experiencing it again a little sharper, more colourful and up-to-date. If you're a Hitchcock veteran and love the original, you might be disappointed by the different actors and the fact that the creepy black and white atmosphere is drained from it by default. If you've never seen Psycho, well, this is a great way of experiencing it without having to accommodate for datedness.While there is some occasional cheapness due to remaking a scene exactly, for example a certain exact remake of a violent scene on a staircase seems a little fake in a 1998 film, Psycho's message makes it through, and it's definitely one to show to your younger siblings (or whoever else) whose minds aren't open enough to watch a black and white movie.Did anybody really imagine Saul Bass' opening credits to be lime green like that though? Ha ha! Red, if anything!Pointless? Perhaps. But I certainly believe that it's worth doing what you can to keep something good alive, where restrictions of its time cause it to become dated and less accessible. The original has a better atmosphere (due to the black and white) but the story and suspense make it through just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was designed to be an exact copy of the original, so it's surprising to see how Gus Van Sant has managed to make one of the worst films ever, never mind the worst remake ever. But I won't review it as a film in it's own right, there's no point in that.Although the director made every attempt to recreate the shots, music, sound effects etc. exactly as they were in the original, he still managed to ruin the film. There are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is the cast. My god, I don't think I've seen a worse cast in my life. None of the actors play the characters as they are supposed to be played: Vince Vaughn plays Normans Bates as a psychopath, rather than a character the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for, and the scenes where he wears a wig are just laughable; Anne Hech makes the audience WANT her to die; and William H. Macy doesn't play the suspicious detective that Arbogast is supposed to be.Pouring salt into the wound, Van Sant even decides to ruin the camera work. You don't alter what is effectively perfect, and although he put in some shots that Hitchcock would have loved to have had, he adds some shots that just leave the audience wondering what the hell is going on, such as the images flashing in the death scenes.Hitchcock was very particular when it came to lighting and Mise-en-sc?ne, and Van Sant may have had a DVD player with him to study Psycho, but he obviously didn't do a good enough job. One of the most notable examples of this is in Norman's parlour, where the lighting and prop placement is horrible, and you also see Vince Vaughn at his worst.Basically, do not watch this film. The only reason I've seen it was to compare it to the original for a Media Studies class. Now, you might say I'm defending Hitchcock because I'm a Media Studies student, but I could have been studying film for 10 years, or Psycho could have been the first film I'd ever seen, and I would still agree that it is a masterpiece. If you want to see Psycho, please watch the original, and don't listen to the reviews that say "It's a great experiment" or "Gus Van Sant had the guts to do this, therefore it's amazing". It is not an experiment, it was supposed to be a copy of Psycho with added shots and dialogue that Hitchcock would have wanted, but it was absolutely terrible. If you want to respect anyone for having guts, respect Hitchcock. He was crossing the line of what was allowed on films, and it's unlikely that modern cinema would be as it is if it wasn't for Psycho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad shot-for-shot remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's horror classic, Psycho, where we have Anne Heche portraying Marion Crane, a Phoenix secretary who steals $400,000 from her employer's client so she could start a new life with boyfriend Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). While on the way to meet up with him, she checks into a remote motel run by the mysterious and mother-dominated Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn).As the story and plot were the same in this remake as in the original, it is still a movie full of suspense, intrigue and excitement. The music adaptation by Danny Elfman was eerie and haunting, matching the drama and horror elements of the film.While this movie is nearly identical to the original one, there are some updated elements including Marion's car-make, upping the stolen cash from $40,000 to $400,000, styles of clothing, and character chemistry. Vaughn did a nice job portraying Bates, as well as William H. Macy as Milton Arbogast and Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Chambers. However, I thought Heche overdid it a little in her portrayal of Marion Crane, forcing surprised and confused facial expressions as if trying to contrast herself from Janet Leight's portrayal in the original movie. Mortensen as Sam Loomis looked like an emotionless hick who didn't seem to be moved by what is going on, and Julianne Moore murmured almost all her Lila Crane's lines quickly, and looked like she was angry at the entire town.Even with the downsides I've pointed out, this remake of "Psycho" is still a treat to watch - no over-the-top stuff, just the perfect balance of pure drama and horror.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright I was like a majority of people when it comes to remakes, they normally stink, so i was very hesitant about watching this. Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director of all time and I thought anyone else trying to ride his coat tails is just a no talent director looking for a way to make a buck. But honestly I didn't have a problem with this. It was a shot for shot remake very few differences in script scenery and emotion. I was too fond of the adding of color the movie still hits harder in black and white then it does with color, but what movie doesn't... Exception Wizard of Oz. The acting is actually pretty good better then anticipated Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche do a great job doing their reprisal of my favorite scene in the movie when both are in the parlor. Really the only downfall was Julianne Moore acting like a punk and acting more aggressive, Vera Miles had an Oscar worthy performance in the original should have just stuck with it. But my favorite addition was Vigo Mortinson, I admit never been a huge fan of his but he was very good as Sam Loomis, and honestly he was in my opinion better then John Gavin, who even Alfred Hitchcock wasn't pleased with. All in all it's a remake so don't get your hopes up for something that will surpass the original which was as close to a perfect horror film as you can get, but do expect to be entertained after all that's why movies are made and this one certainly entertained me, It just didn't blow me away like the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho (The Hitchcock Version) was a great movie! But, like most classics, it had to have a re-make. Oh, why!?!? The film has all the footage, but changes some minor things, such as Marion has an umbrella, there are stickers on her car, and Norman has a bird cage in his basement. Gus doesn't really add anything new. Plus, it is in color.The color is the main flaw. It makes the film seem uncomfortable, and made me feel uneasy. It doesn't hold the timeless feeling of the original Hitchcock version. Besides, they messed up the shower scene with color. Marions bright hair, light skin, and bright blood don't exactly scream out "scary" but more of "bad lighting" or "Gus, make some other films instead!" If you remember, Vince Vaughn played in such comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball. So, whose idea was it to put him in a wannabe-horror film? He's the villain too; not just some innocent bystander waiting to be killed!The 1998 re-make is about the same as the original, except worse...much worse. This was just pointless. You have a 1960 classic, so why make the exact same thing over again?Let's just hope Gus Van Sant never touches Jaws or any other films like that.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus van Sant is a good director in several films, but why he has to go in for remakes or rehashes is beyond me - especially talking about this masterpiece by Hitchcock. The original work should be left untouched, especially when it is superb in its making.Do not get me wrong: I am not one of those penchants for upholding Hollywood's 30s, 40, 50s "great" (sic) days of film-making. All those Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, Rita Hayworth, Randolph Scott, Rene Dunne, Cedric Hardwicke, James Stewart, David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Walter Pigeon, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra (yuck and double yuck), Tony Curtis, Brian Aherne, James Cagney..........and many more of the same ilk, have me retching and reaching for the "off" switch or button immediately. "Vanilla Sky" is a recent example of a terrible remake-rehash of an originally good film. "Gone with the Wind" should have gone with the last hurricane, and "Casablanca" would have been nothing if the film had used the real Arabic name of 'ad-dru l-bayd' in Maghrabi or Addru Lbayd in Berber..............I mean, can you imagine anyone writing their own version of Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot"? Could anyone stand any of Shakespeare transposed into modern grunge-rap? Could anyone stomache Springsteen doing his version of "Ball and Chain"? Is it possible to imagine Gunther Grass' "Hundejahre" converted into a humorous farce? Could you take Vaughan-Williams' "Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis" played in flamenco.........?I could go on, but I do not wish to bore anyone.Remakes and other rehabilitations at best are only rehashes, and at worst sickening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock blasphemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this brief: if you have seen the original version of Psycho, the same one that Alfred Hitchcock made under secret conditions and, once shown, shocked the world, do not see this remake. If you have not seen the original, well, don't see this remake. I am a firm believer in remaking a movie only if it can be made with a significant creative change or artistic contribution. The original was a film that could be improved on in no way, shape, or form. The simple action of filming in color is ridiculous! And although there are several fans who revere Vince Vaughn, I found his performance in this remake pathetic and derivative, a hopeless attempt to recreate the insanity that Tony Perkins brought to the role originally. See the original...again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POLITICALLY INCORRECT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is politically incorrect. Anyone who has ever watched any of the other 4 original Psycho movies starring Anthony Perkins, knows that NORMAN BATES DOES NOT MASTURBATE!!! His mother taught him it was not right for a boy to get erections, especially not over his own mother, (which isn't right anyway, but hey.)So, for Norman's actions, he was placed in a dress. So from then on, Norman wore a dress when he felt the "urge." Which is why he puts on the dress when he kills the woman in the shower, not only to act as his mother, but because the dress is the way he releases the "urge."I believe the only reason they added the masturbation part is to appeal to today's generation. Every movie in one way or another has a sex scene. Anyone who's ever seen the original knows...Norman knows no sexual relations, whether it be with himself or with a parter. If you want to see the Politically CORRECT version, and the one that scared so many people back in the day, watch the one in Black and White.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people these days just can't stop whining. Take the new PSYCHO for example - there's plenty of great reasons to see this film, but all I'm hearing is 'how could they do that,' and 'they destroyed a masterpiece,' and 'Hitchcock must be turning over in his grave.' C'mon people, it's a free country! It doesn't matter if the original was a classic or not - this is America, for cryin' out loud. As for the movie itself, there is absolutely nothing to complain about - Gus Van Sant has taken on a truly heroic effort, and pulled it off spectacularly. The movie is creepy in that although it has a mew look, it's the same thing; even the shower head is the same. And how can you gritch about the actors? Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy... all of them did fine jobs. So lighten up already, people! Let good movies be good movies, and go whine about something else - like Dorf, or the latest summer blockbuster. PSYCHO is a great movie - period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to scare anybody and I certainly don't want to offend anybody, but I have come to realize that Gus Van Sant's exploration of Hitchcock's 'psycho' is quite simply one of the most baffling masterpieces of the last decade.My ideas aren't entirely concrete and I know millions will think I'm crazy or stupid. However, here are a few of the things I'm thinking about:- The original 'psycho' is arguably the key to all cinema. The definitive film about the nature of film. Hitchcock meanwhile stands monolithically above all other film makers and particularly in a derived psychoanalytic context is essential to the understanding of film as a cultural phenomenon. - The reworking of his greatest film immediately implies 'homage' - particularly in its shot for shot detail.- The historical space between the two films is approximately thirty years - think about all the things that have happened in terms of western civilization.- In the new film we know for sure that Bates is masturbating - in the original it is only implied. Also, there is more blood involved and a little more nudity.- Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' involved the making over of a woman to look like another. To recreate what has been lost due to some internal, repressed desire. It has been suggested that this idea comes straight from the id of Hitchcock himself. Is the reworking of 'psycho' therefore a recreation of 'Hitchcock' and all the horror of his imagination.- As people die in Van Sant's film, images flash by, supposedly images possessed by the victim, but they are images of disconcerting arbitrariness. Is Hitchcock's film falling apart at the seams, torn from its auteur by some third party, disseminated throughout film history, disrupted by the imperfection of its multifarious successors?- Fundamentally, and here is the true horror of our experience as film spectators, it is as though history is repeating itself thirty years on, but this time the blood is harder to wash away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically A Colour Remake of The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest; it isn't quite the same as the original (despite the plot being identical to the original). A completely different set of actors and a few casting risks that didn't quite pay off. Vince Vaughn did a reasonably good acting job as Norman Bates but didn't provide me with the emotional connection that Anthony Perkins did for me. I do wonder why Vaughn hasn't been in any horror films since participating Psycho. Anne Heche certainly has the ideal look for Marion Crane. However she didn't really provide the greatest of acting quality to pull it off. I found Viggo Mortensen's voice on the borderline grating and completely different to John Gavin's interpretation of Sam Loomis (but not in a good way). The scenes were almost identical and the script was basically the same, instead the whole movie was in colour and as I previously mentioned, the cast was different. I found the original freaky but this had a scare factor of 2/5 stars. At least Gus Van Der Sant and the crew tried. It just fell flat, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho (1998): Dir: Gus Van Sant / Cast: Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen: An unnecessary shot for shot remake of the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. Anne Heche is cast as Marion Crane who leaves town with a large sum of money and makes a fatal stop at the Bates Motel where she dies a horrible death. An investigator is hired to find her while Marion's sister and boyfriend await answers. Gus Van Sant previously dazzled viewers with provocative films such as Good Will Hunting and To Die For but here he fails in what is hardly shot for shot. Heche does mirror the posturing of Janet Leigh but her death in the famous shower scene is reduced to graphic overkill that wasn't needed. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates replaces the innocence of Anthony Perkins with a sinister gaze and a nervous laugh that renders him less sympathetic. As the investigator William H. Macy comes off as knowing he is on camera. The images of bulls and whatnot during his death also makes no sense. Julianne Moore comes off as too bitchy as Crane's sister as oppose to the genuine concern expressed by Vera Miles. And finally, the boyfriend, played poorly by Viggo Mortensen, comes off as a creepy pervert as oppose to the gentleman in the original. Congratulations to Van Sant for making an embarrassing piece of sh*t unfit for his talent. Score: ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, pointless remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often enjoy fresh takes on classic old stories (like what they did with this year's Maleficent), but this movie is just horrendous. It is an insult to my favorite film of all time and proves that shot-for-shot remakes are absolutely pointless. Everything was the same EXCEPT it is in color, and it is set in 1998. They added a bit more sexuality (we see Viggo Mortensen's butt in the beginning and Anne Heche's after she is murdered in the shower). Also, there is that really stupidly made scene where Norman Bates masturbates while watching Marion undress, which is utter disrespect to the suspenseful original scene back in 1960. There were also additions of some weird visions of a cow and a nude woman during Arbogast's murder which made no sense. The performances were laughable. Anne Heche was awful and unlikeable. Sam was annoying and I didn't like Julianne Moore's take on Lila. Vince Vaughn's casting as Norman was downright terrible. He was awkward all around and did not suit the part at all. This movie lacks what made that Hitchcock masterpiece so amazing. It was made in the 60s, a time period where films like this were not thought of, but this was made in a period where the goriest movies are loved by many. Also, there was nothing of the grace and elegance and the brilliance of the 1960s Psycho, which were Hitchcock's directing, Anthony Perkins, iconic black-and-white element and the glorious set. All in all, this film is just bad and pointless and I would not recommend it to any true film fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I know another remake but you got to admit this movie is pretty close to what I remember as the original just in color and I think that was the selling point (even though it flopped at the box office) pretty much line for line except at the end in the cop station when in the original they mention the word Homosexual. Pretty bold word for it's time by the way. But Anne Heche does an excellent job in reprising Janet Leigh's role and so does young Vince Vaugn. Great selection in cast including the cop on the highway. He is a good actor from previous films witch I can't remember at this time. But I know no one will ever replace the original film it is truly a masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock. He was so far ahead of his time. Years ahead of his time. But i'm certainly glad this new Director copied his exact film work pans and zooms. Would have sucked if someone like Rob Zombie directed it would of been too forward. lol. I know there is people out there that hate this remake but you got to admit that the director kept it true to Hicthcock's original film and tried to keep it simple. Which is good when it comes to remakes. Unlike the Friday the 13th remake by the Micheal Bay Productions. What a horrible remake. Well bravo to the director of this film he captured everything Hitchcock did except in color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>re-make or re-felt?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually would have been utterly and maybe incurably shocked if I had seen this movie if it weren't a remake. I was flabbergasted instead. Hitchcock was the prodigy of his period, and he proves to be still valid. The story (and the storyboard) belongs to him. And the movie *is* amazing. I have to admit though that the acting is much better than the original, although Anthony Perkins seems to have that psycho embedded in him, almost congenitally. The color picks are absolutely striking; I have to reconcile with van Sant in his thoughts that the "master" would have chosen the same color scales if the original were shot in color. The plot seems to be weak for today's gore and cheap psychology imposed viewer, and is no puzzle insoluble, but this doesn't stop the avid moviegoer from admiring the outstandingly deliberate way van Sant manages his project. It is obvious that not only Gus van Sant, but the whole crew has re-felt the emotions "Psycho" recalls and arises, and thus the originality and misunderstanding of the re-make.But of course, I still couldn't figure out who I should praise more. Hitchcock or van Sant?</fullReview>

The movie was good for its time since it was one of the first of the slasher movies to come out. This movie is not even worth seeing on video let alone on the big screen. Also there were several scenes which were not necessary, like where you see Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) watching Marion Crane (Anne Heche) shower, just not good taste.

		<shortDescription>An Homage to a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very easy to dismiss Van Sant's recreation of a Hitchcock classic as egotistic and self-gratifying. Especially because the film is virtually identical to Hitch's, from the Saul Bass title sequence to the choreography of the infamous shower scene, we ask "Is this really necessary?" For those who ask why, I ask why not? Van Sant surely can get the funding and because of the excellent material the film will certainly at least break even. The film is not an act of one-upmanship, but rather an homage to a revered director. That being said, I must admit the big disappointment in Van Sant's film is the acting of Vince Vaughn; his performance is more comical than creepy. His effort to introduce a nervous laugh into Bates' character is a testament to his inability to act as subtly as his late counterpart. In addition,in the tradition films like Strangers on a Train and Rope, the ambiguity of the murderer's sexual orientation is an important complexity in Hitch's characters. Van Sant carelessly assumes Bates' hetrosexuality and affirms it with the scene of masturbation and the revelation of Norman's bedtime reading material. Like the overacting, of Vaughn, the remake of Psycho suffers from a lack of subtlety found in the original. The new cross-cutting in the two murder scenes are provocative, but as a whole, Van Sant leaves less to interpretation.</fullReview>

I was expecting to see the psychological thriller that I remembered from the original, but the new one is much more -- it is more of a horror film, which is a good thing if you ask me! The score was updated by Danny Elfman, and that added a whole new level of interest for me. I would highly recommend this one for anybody who is even remotely interested in the horror or thriller genras. Personally, I didn't understand why they chose Vince Vaughn to play the lead -- that is, until the end. A perfect role for him.</fullReview>

And the end, when Robert Forster explains everything, is so rushed that it is impossible to understand. The acting is terrible, with the exception of Macy, who plays Arbogast fairly well. Even if this film, wasn't a butcher of the original, it would still be bad. Titanic had more suspense. The film was a consistent disappointment from beginning to end, with few redeeming factors.

Everyone in the theatre boo'd when the movie was over, comments like "that sucked" or "what the hell were they thinking" were overheard.

		<shortDescription>Want a good horror movie? Watch "Psycho" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skip this review if you haven't seen the original "Psycho". From the time I first heard about this film, I recognized the fact that a remake was unnecessary. If the original was good enough to go back to the big screen, why not just re-release it? I had heard that it was shot-by-shot, word for word, a replica of the 1960 film. It does resemble the original more than most remakes do, but the differences, though few, make a tremendous difference, and were, for the most part, disadvantages to the film. There was, of course, the occasional omission/addition of a line that helped a little, but by no means did that compensate for the changes for the worse. The acting fluctuated from better to worse than the original; some lines were delivered more convincingly, and others less convincingly. The one line that was in my opinion the most important one the filmmakers should have concentrated on was Perkins'/Vaughn's line "We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?" The line lost all of the creepiness it had in the original. The biggest difference overall in the movie was the scene where Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) is looking through the hole at Marion Crane (Anne Heche) in the bathroom. As it is explained at the end of the movie, Norman Bates is never completely himself, but what they did with this scene ignores that fact completely. In the original film, the person watching Marion is not psychologically Norman at all, but either the filmmakers missed the point of that scene or I did, not to mention the lack of necessity for the change. While director Gus Van Sant completely neglected the need to keep some details the same, he paid close attention to others, such as an Alfred Hitchcock look-alike in the background the same place he was in the original (scene 2, first shot, cowboy hat), the intentionally outdated special effect when Detective Arbogast (William H. Macy) falls down the stairs, etc. Basically, they neglected keeping the important details constant due to watching the minor ones too closely. Another example clashed with the date on which it took place, in December (since that's when it was released), because for a December in Arizona, Mr. Lowry (Rance Howard) sure did complain about the intense heat a lot. A nice touch in Hitchcock's version was that Marion Crane's underwear was white (white traditionally representing good, angelic) until she stole the money, in which case it was black, (traditionally meaning evil, sinister) which was a neat little symbol Alfred Hitchcock used. In Van Sant's version it goes from orange to green, a deep symbol for Marion Crane having weird taste in clothes. The biggest detail that they kept constant for the remake was including Bernard Hermann's classic soundtrack (how can the shower scene exist without the famous string section) which was helped along seamlessly and in keeping with the "strings only" rule by 25% of Oingo Boingo (Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek; Batman, Men In Black). The pseudo-nudity in the original became brief moments of actual nudity, which can truly be called unnecessary since it was successfully avoided in the original. The death scenes were intercut with different footage, which detracted from them rather than improving them. In the shower scene, it was footage of the rapidly moving clouds. In the stairway scene it was footage of a naked woman and a sheep. To clarify that footage as much as possible, that was what was on a television in the background, but there was no readily apparent point to having them there. Character development was also different, though not really a plus or minus for the movie. Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen) came off as being much more of a sleeze, for example. Julianne Moore does a good performance, as do Vaughn, Macy, and Heche, especially considering the fact that they were faced with having to live up to an existing standard set by the original. It was mainly the film itself that was the problem. As was the case with "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer", this movie did the original no justice. However, at least "Psycho" was a remake that can easily be forgotten and doesn't give the permanent scars a bad sequel inflicts on a good original film. If you want to experience "Psycho" again, make it the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went out to see 'Psycho,' I read some reviews and some comments from the IMDb, and it didn't look too promising. I mean, wasn't expecting anything new, as it's more of an updated version than a remake. I think it was nice idea, because now that modernized it a tad, you can compare it to horror movies nowadays because most people who are fans of the horror genre today don't know about the movies that started it all. MOST, not all. Everyone on the server was bitching about how all the actors were bad, but I thought they were all pretty good. Vince Vaughn surprised me, but of course no one can surpass Tony Perkins. Plus, I was sort of laughing when Vaughn came out in the wig and dress. He looked REALLY FUNNY. I really didn't like Janet Leigh in the original, and I was shocked to find out than she received an Oscar nomination but Perkins didn't. What I'm saying is that Anne Heche wasn't so horrid, she was pretty good. Viggo Mortensen was a tad annoying, but tolerable. I'm a Julianne Moore freak, so she's one reason I went to see this, but biased opinions aside, she was pretty good. William H. Macy was cool, as well. The good thing about this film is that none of the performances ever stood out or overshadowed someone elses, as in the original. The "Let me get my Walkman" and "If it doesn't jell it isn't Jell-O" lines were really stupid, but they didn't take away all that much from the film. One thing that was really annoying was when Abergast and Crane were killed, they flashed to pictures of rain storms, cows, and this woman who had no connection with the movie. I guess it's possible that was what was going through the victim's mind at the time. The opening credits were really awesome, too. I hear people complaining all the time about the masturbation scene and Lila finding the porn magazine in Norman's room. I think Van Sant was trying to bring Bates' repression to the '90s, because in the '60s they would not be allowed to go into that directly. I mean, I'm assuming Norman is still a virgin, and any human being, regardles of their mental state, would have some sort of physical desire. And Gus did it very tastefully, considering what could've been done nowadays. Another thing that was re-introduced was the camera angles. We forget how much of a revolution the original 'Psycho' really was. In the shower, the coolest angle is when the camera looks directly at the shower head, but the lens doesn't get wet at all. Or when Mother murdered Abergast, the way he almost didn't fall down the stairs until a few slashes crossed his face. Much more innovative than 'Scream' or 'I know what you did last summer.' Another thing people complained about was Heche's outfits for the movie. I'll admit, they were pretty retro, but let's remember how she dresses in real life. Do we remember that horrid red dress and hat she wore to the VH1 Fashion Awards? All in all, it was pretty enjoyable, seven or an eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a neat idea to make a replica instead of a remake, and since Hitchcock is known for his meticulous prep., storyboarding and low shooting ratio, and Psycho is universally known for particular shots and sequences, to make a new version of it is I think a touch of brilliance - and boldness. And it works. It was fun and worth the ticket just to see the idea executed. It was a thrill to see the same credits and hear the music. But as well, van Sant portrays a funny 60/98 world and Chris Doyle's cinematography captures it. Vince Vaughn does an admirable job as Norman. Only miss is Anne Heche.

This, however, is somewhat false. Van Sant, for the most part, shot the film "closer" than did Hitchcock: many long shots became medium shots, medium shots became close ups. Furthermore, Van Sant included odd, non-diegetic images during the most intense action scenes (you can guess which ones). Depending upon your own theoretical stance as to the importance of these differences, you might be content to call this film a remake and leave it at that.However, if you would rather concentrate on the overwhemling similarities between the two versions, of which there are certainly more than in any other "remake" of any film ever, you would be necessarily inclined to brand Van Sant's "Psycho" as what it very well could be, an imitation.One last note: quite often, bands "cover" other groups' songs. (As one example, Nirvana covered David Bowie's "Man Who Sold the World".) However, the degree to which the cover resembles the original is the basis not so much by which the cover is deemed a tribute or a rip-off but rather for deciding whether or not the band is profiting off the work of others. Therefore, are Universal and even Van Sant praiseworthy of an excellent "tribute" or shameless in their greed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for fans of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just have to voice my opinion on this new remake of Psycho. It may not be a half-assed attempt to take the idea of a Hitchcock film and turn it into something more contemporary (Rear Window, A Perfect Murder), but its decisions on where to pay homage to the original and where to embark on its own decisions make the movie more choppy and awkward than it should have been. The thing I liked about the original, and still do over the new version, is that Norman Bates' character had a boyish innocence to it. Vince Vaughn turns the character into an overly moody, and somewhat agresive geek. He doesn't even seem to believe his own lines. I can't blame him totally for his off target performance since the lines, written to sound normal and like "small-talk" in the 60's, sound too strange and pointless. "Twelve cabins, twelve vancancies." is said by Vaughn like a simple minded little boy, while Perkins actually dilivered it sounding natural and like an everyday sort of comment. The script needed more than the very few touch-ups that were applied to better explain a small amount of the points in the movie. Van Sant just couldn't decide if he was actually trying to remake the original shot-for-shot (it is up to the shower scene), or turn it into a newer story more set in today's world. My final gripe with Van Sant's version is Anne Heche. She seemed like a resonable choice for Janet Leigh's role, but she comes off stupid and like she really isn't thinking at all. Van Sant can't even pick good times to poke fun at the original. Heche's outfits for the movie are downright outrageous, and distracting. They draw so much attention to themselves that you forget that there is a story going on. I cringed thinking of the original when she pulled out an umbrella that looked like a big bright version of a decoration for a drink in a bar. The only thing that I can commend Van Sant for is that he has brought Psycho to a new generation, that although may not appreciate or have seen the original, can find a good shock from the story. It actually could have been a good film if Van Sant had decided what kind of movie he wanted to make. The new version is definitely NOT for film buffs or fans of the original Hitchcock version. However for those who can't stand the idea of watching actors from a different time or a film shot in black &amp; white, this is a movie you should definitely see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things, like fine wine and Paul Newman, get better with age...but this version of Psycho isn't one of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two big misconceptions that must be pointed out before I start:1. It's not a sacrilege to remake a great film. Any serious art-form regularizes this as a standard practice.2. Any discernible talent that Van Sant showed with Drugstore Cowboy, has apparently left him in droves.With these in mind, I was sorely disappointed with this lackluster remake. Poorly conceived and executed in an amateurish fashion, this new film's failure can be directly attributed to Van Sant and his decisions. Perhaps too extensive of a list to mention point by point; the biggest mistake of the film was to cast Vince Vaughn in the lead role. While the rest of the supporting cast was surprisingly poor as well, they at least tried to give their charcters a new spin. Vaughn, it appears, was totally incapable of conceiving a new Norman Bates. His parody of Perkins' Bates was laughably horrible. Compare Vaughn's imitation of Anthony Perkins with Kenneth Branagh's imitation of Woody Allen in Celebrity. While I deplored Celebrity as a film, Branagh's imitation was certainly right on the mark. For me, Vaughn's Bates went permanently south the moment he copied Perkins' little laugh in the opening moments of his performance - not an auspicious beginning by any stretch of the imagination.This glaring mistake aside, the film also suffered from poor directorial choices: 1)The poorly parodic addition of a Hitchcock-like character in a short background scene, 2)The addition of whispering voices barely audible in the Bates House, 3)The not-so-subtlely oneristic voyeurism scene, 4)The Silence of the Lambs-like aviary scene at the end of the film, and, finally, the horribly "chic" conception of Lila as a vengeful dyke ...all of which played generically off-key. The film's over-arcing problem lies squarely with Van Sant. His attitude, that the film is perfect and should be honored by a shot-for-shot remake, was erroneous. The film, which is certainly great, is far from perfect. A really talented director would have realized its shortcomings and, in the ultimate gesture of reverence, tried to totally reconceptualize the film and make it better. As a result of all these errors, the film lost all it's internal and Freudian complexity and exists as a cheap and superficial remake. Moving from Drugstore Cowboy, to the generic Hollywood melodrama Good Will Hunting, to the aping of a hollywood classic - Van Sant's career is shaping up to be fairly inept. Why, it couldn't even hurt a fly.</fullReview>

What an idiotic snafu and a dreadful disrespect to the audience right up front! The cinematography - lighting and camerawork, is horrible throughout and is an insult to the integrity of the story and the actors. Despite this, Anne Heche manages to shine again but what a pathetic, poor choice for Norman Bates is Vince Vaughn. Bad casting there! An affront to the memory of Anthony Perkins. After seeing Gus van Sant's brilliant previous work, this one is a great disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Hitchcock, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither a great film nor as bad as its numerous critics say it is, Psycho (1998) will be recorded in film history as an interesting if not entirely successful experiment.I can totally see what director Gus Van Sant was going for. So many remakes of beloved films draw complaints...and most of them are about how Hollywood screwed up what was a good story. In this film -- the only one of its kind, as far as I know -- Van Sant went for a literal remake...a shot-by-shot near-duplication of the original film.Oh, there are a few differences. Now that filmmaking is less puritanical, we actually get to see poor Marion Crane with stab wounds, as well as Norman Bates masturbating as he watches her shower. These do modernize the film for the present day without getting grotesque or exploitative. (The scenes are handled with relative restraint and do not come anywhere near approaching the explicitness of any number of other modern movies.)Still, bringing this film into the present day is a puzzling contradiction when much of the rest of the look of the film looks like it's set in the 1960s (opening graphics notwithstanding). Buildings look out-of-date. The dialog and camera movements seem quaint. Even the film's coloring looks like Kodak film stock from the 1960s.Which is not a criticism, just a note that all this doesn't juxtapose well with the aforementioned shower and masturbating scenes...not to mention declaring outright that the movie takes place in 1998.And of course one can argue with the casting -- that Anne Heche is no Janet Leigh, and that Vince Vaughn is certainly no match for Anthony Perkins. Heche is a puzzling choice. She may just have been coming out of the closet when this film was released; nevertheless she now seems an odd choice for the part of a woman carrying out a torrid love affair with a man in seedy hotels. Even her waif-like hair and figure only serve to enhance her contrast with the voluptuous, more traditionally beautiful Janet Leigh.And Vince Vaughn loses on two counts. First, he's not particularly good in this. Perhaps no one could have adequately followed the boyish, delicate, twitchy Perkins, but Vaughn does little if anything to make this role his own. And second -- and this is certainly no fault of the director -- the kind of roles Vaughn has chosen to take since this one have pretty much eradicated any chance that viewers will take him seriously in this role.For all its problems, however, this film does answer the question, "What if somebody tried to make a remake, a shot-for-shot remake, of a classic film, only in color and with a little judicious updating?" We now know the answer: you get mixed results.</fullReview>

Billed as a "shot for shot remake" Gus amateurishly apes the Hitchock film, poorly imitating the original. But that not being bad enough, he also occasionally adds scenes that weren't in the original film - like Norman Bates masturbating while looking through the peep hole at Marion undressing, complete with gratuitous sounds to fully illustrate his not-so subtle action.This is a ham-fisted clumsy attempt to parrot a much more talented director's work. It isn't art, it isn't clever - it is plagiarism and badly done at that. It adds nothing to the original except color and tacky scenes, and that certainly ain't an improvement.BOMB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of Hitchcock's PSYCHO done in 1998 by Gus Van Sant is just that: a REmake! The plot follows faithfully the previous film, the characters are the same, almost all speech is the same; it's truly like the original except in one detail: the acting! They are all professional and good actors but, God knows why, they all do incredible low performances (except, perhaps, Julianne Moore)! At parts they throw out the text as they were not acting. In other moments they even seem they are joking with the characters, as they don't seem to take the role too seriously! Anne Heche never convinces doing "Marion Crane". She's smiling when she's supposed to be scared and she never seemed to take this role seriously? Vince Vaughn as "Norman Bates" is just hilarious! Come on, this guy is good as an actor doing comedies, yet doing a psychopath! Just if the idea would do a "Scary Psycho Movie", if you know what I mean! Viggo Mortensen and Willian Macy do regular jobs, but they can do better.Julianne Moore did the most convincing job, in my point of view.The plot, like I said before, is just like the original except in a few and absolutely insignificant details. But one of them has put me thinking: Why "Arbogast" sees a naked woman and a sheep crossing a street while he's being stabbed by "Norman Bates"?! In the original such images don't appear, and I just can't find out the meaning of them (if there's one!)? So, in my point of view, they transformed a very good movie in a mediocre one, mostly because of the bad acting. Apart from that, it's not a bad film, since it follows the original.</fullReview>

Macy with similar character at Martin Balsam), her sister(Julianna Moore-Vera Miles)along with Sam(Viggo Mortensen)are looking for to Marion, asking help to sheriff(Philip Baker Hall-John McIntire).The story is a rip off from original classic picture,frame-for-frame, with a few news scenes though filmed in glimmer color and lensed beautifully by cameraman Christopher Doyle.Thus,it contains the same screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch infused with deliciously macabre wit,plenty of grisly murders,stabbing shots,horror,suspense and lots of blood.The highlights film are,of course,the famous murder of Marion Crane-Anne Heche completely copied scene-for-scene although with a few more nudism and the creepy final images where is turned out the killing conclusion.Again the suspenseful music score,adding impressive excitement,nowadays deemed a classic soundtrack by Bernard Hermann is arranged by Danny Elffman.The motion picture is regularly directed by Gus Van Sant(Drugstore cowboy,Elephant,among others),nowadays considered a cult-director.The original Hitchcock film is highly superior to this one and the numerous movies which tried duplicate it, like as : Psycho II(1983) by Richard Franklin,Psycho III(1986)by Anthony Perkins,and for cable TV :PsychoIV(1990)by Mick Garris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly 10 Years Later, and it Still STINKS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let it be known: if anyone into movies wonders about the possibility of a PSYCHO remake that DOESN'T stink to high Heaven, then all they have to do is rent and/or view Brian de Palma's DRESSED TO KILL. If you strip away the detail and analyze the movie to its bare essentials, this is the official remake -- or in my own terms, reconfiguration -- of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of modern horror that screamed into theatres in 1960 and has not since been equaled in the capacity to induce dread and terror in its frightful incursions into violence, seen in the much-imitated but never equaled shower scene, and secondly, in Arbogast's doomed climb up the stairs, into the deadly secret hidden behind the doors of the Bates Motel.Why would someone like Gus Van Sant, a director who up until 1997 had created some pretty memorable movies like MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO and TO DIE FOR decide to go ahead and literally re-create Hitchcock's movie down to minimal shots? I don't know. I recall that when I went to theatres, out of curiosity in late 1998 when it was released, there wasn't a yawn or a stifled expression of surprise even by the younger crowd when the two most violent scenes came to pass. Somehow, in trying to re-create the magic that the original PSYCHO (1960) cemented, crucial arteries were severed, and all the blood necessary to pump life into its veins was lost, not in bloodshed, but in futility.It was as if a collective sigh of "been there, done that, what's next" had descended upon the entire theatre and people just couldn't be bothered anymore. Needless to say, 1998 also saw the resurgence of the slasher movie especially aimed at the theme of the dead teenager, and by then J-horror was all the rage, shocking everyone with its use of minimalism and downright unsettling images in order to convey a sense of inescapable terror. Robert Bloch's tale of the the unfortunate Marion Crane seemed, by now, really old news -- the kind that arrives by freight, and weeks late, to the most remote outposts on the Earth. Down to its montage -- reminiscent of the type of coloration used in the 60s -- to pretty much the entire plot, PSYCHO (1998) is what should never, EVER be done by anyone interested in re-configuring or re-creating a film as a subject of an admiration. Ever.Nothing can save this movie. Danny Elfman's score is spot-on, but Bernard Herrmann composed and created it first, so it's a moot point as to which one should be listened to. Hitchcock wanted that opening shot to zoom into the hotel where Marion meets Sam, and this movie does have it, but it adds nothing. There are odd little quirks that pop up out of nowhere -- such as Marion re-arranging the money within the paper before taking a bath, or Norman pleasuring himself quite noisily as he watches Marion take a shower, or Lila enunciating lines like "Let me get my Walkman" before re-affirming her lesbian nature as a force which cannot be contained, or those out-of-place shots of storm clouds, cows standing forlorn on an empty road, or that strange-looking woman wearing a mask at the scene of Arbogast's death. Neither of them contribute a single thing to PSYCHO (1998). This is a mistake in every sense of the word. It hasn't improved over the years, but turned completely colorless despite the saturation of color that is splashed throughout the movie and a caricature of horror. Thank goodness the actors involved have moved on to much better projects!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..make this carbon copy of the original terrible. It's already been stated over and over, but i can't help but feel the need to add my own two cents for some closure. I can't see how someone can really think to re-shoot a movie from the 1960's scene for scene. The original movie, while being a classic, is clearly with it's visual quips that could have been easily fixed with today's technology. Take for instance the opening of the first scene. The aerial camera panning from outside the hotel window in one fluid manner into the room. In the original, it's cut a few times, to try and emulate that effect, but with technology available back then, I don't think it could have been done. The new film updates the effect. Good start. Unfortunately, other then Normon's masturbation scene, not much else has changed. Even Marian seems to be wearing retro styled outfits which don't mesh with the times AND Normon still invites her up for "sandwiches and milk". Sandwiches and milk? How about Subway and a Pepsi. With old movies comes a forgiveness. I watch a black and white film and see it at as a movie done from a different era. The feel and dynamic of everything is drastically different from modern film making and most of what it visual fails to deliver is attainable in the overall aura of the story. the original Psycho is no exception to that rule of forgiveness. Maybe the shower scene silhouette effect was a turning point in film making for the year in which it was developed, but by 2005's standards it just doesn't cut the mustard. It's things like this that should have been changed but haven't. Of course, i'm just talking aesthetics but these visual elements keep the new version feeling dated still. Afterall, it was made about 4 decades ago. If you're not going to change the dialog, the style of acting, or the story, How about a technology update at least?</fullReview>

The black and white cinematography enhances Hitchcock's sensational imagery of how a film SHOULD be made. This is just a cheap rip-off of a movie that changed not only the horror genre, but just by the way a movie can impact itself on the industry.

It was well-directed and pretty well-acted with a great music score and great direction--but I always found it kind of slow and dull. Still--this remake was not needed. Why a talented director like Gus van Sant chose to do this is beyond me. But FOR WHAT IT IS...it's actually pretty good.It's NOT a frame by frame remake of the original like some people claim. Things are changed. Van Sant shot the murder scenes differently--a wise choice. Imitating Hitchcock's ones wouldn't have worked. Characters and situations are updated (purportedly Julianne Moore's character is supposed to be a lesbian--but I never caught that) and van Sant directs it (mostly) his way. A few times he does direct it the way Hitchcock would but not all the time.Also the acting is almost uniformly great. Heche is very good in her role and Vaughn is (surprisingly) just terrific as Bates--he plays it differently than Anthony Perkins did and actually adds a new dimension to the character. He plays Norman as a little boy trapped in a man's body...but you also see the anger and violence lurking right underneath the surface. Strong support is given by Julianne Moore and William H. Macy (VERY good) in supporting roles. The only disappointment is Viggo Mortensen. I've never thought he was a good actor and this movie does nothing to change my mind. The southern accent he adopts is particularly silly.I'm not really sure why but this movie seems to move faster than the original. I still think there was no point to remaking the original but I do like this. It was a HUGE critical and commercial bomb so I don't think we'll be seeing anymore Hitchcock remakes.I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Psycho" is one of my favorite movies of all time and is one of the many gems from the great work of Alfred Hitchock. This is not that film. While Director Gus Van Sant copied Hitchcock's work shot-for-shot (with one obvious addition that seems to be way out of place and is just plain disrespectful of the original), it cannot even come close to the original. What I want to know is why was this done? I know remakes have been big in Hollywood for some time, but give me a break.Van Sant obviously didn't try to change anything around from Hitchcock's vision, in fact he tried to copy it exactly. This leads me to one startling conclusion. Gus Van Sant thinks he is a better director than Alfred Hitchcock. What else would be the point of completely remaking this classic shot-for-shot? He thought he could do it better than the master.This film is an utter disgrace and should not be seen by anyone. This is the theoretical relieving oneself on the ashes of a great original. The film has no originality and dreadful casting. There was nothing wrong with the original and you do not try to fix something that isn't broke.The only thing I wish is that I could rate this lower than a 1. This film is pure garbage.1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In dying color...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember a news story not so along ago about a middle eastern oil tycoon who came to America and moved his family into a Beverly Hills estate. The estate was palatial, replete with faux classical Greek statues of human figures in various states of dress and undress. The tycoon, unimpressed with all that shiny white marble, had the statues painted: togas became flashy robes, faces got make overs and even hair was treated to the equivalent of dye jobs, including in the pubic region. The tycoon was proud of his 3-D coloring book, but the neighbors were properly aghast. Instead of fitting in, the tycoon, to his amazement, became a laughing stock.Any similarities between the tycoon and Gus Van Sant are rather obvious. Like so many filmmakers who become critics' darlings, after his success with GOOD WILL HUNTING, Van Sant was struck with the horrifying delusion that he could do no wrong. For reasons that defy common sense, let alone good taste, the director got it into his head that he was just the man to remake of one of the greatest films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO -- despite the fact that Van Sant had never made any film that could even in the wildest sense be termed "Hitchcockian." Not intent with just revamping the story to create an homage to Hitchcock's masterwork, Van Sant decided to re-film PSYCHO scene-for-scene, using the original script and imitating Hitchcock's style set up for set up. His personal contribution: To do it in color. Just like slappin' a coat of paint on a statue. And just as vulgar.If you have never seen the original PSYCHO then this 1998 remake has the empty efficiency of a TV-movie-of-the-week. It has no depth; it has no style; only the bland eagerness to fill up space between commercial interruptions. And there would be nothing wrong with that per se, if that were its intentions. But Van Sant was motivated, not by simple greed, but by an apparent desire to actually make a good movie and one that would compare favorably to Hitchcock's original. Certainly it must have seemed like a great idea to adhere as much as possible to Joseph Stefano's original adaptation. Indeed, the screenplay for PSYCHO is arguable one of the finest ever written: cleverly deceptive, full of surprises, with sharp dialogue and intriguing characters. But, in an attempt to show just how important the screenplay is, Van Sant only seems to have shown what a minor role it actually plays in creating a great, or even watchable film. Both versions of PSYCHO are based on the same template, but side by side they are comparable to the "Mona Lisa" and a paint-by-numbers imitation. The devil is in the details, and Van Sant botches them right down the line.Here's one: In the 1960 version Janet Leigh is first seen in a white bra and slip; when she decides to risk everything and steal some money, she is next seen in black underwear. The symbolism is obvious, maybe even slight, but ever so effective. In the remake, Anne Heche is first seen in orange underwear, then in green underwear. Why? The choice of colors is meaningless, other than to show that Heche's character has bad taste in underwear. The whole movie is like that, color is used just because color is possible. I'm not sure how much thought Hitchcock put into choosing to make PSYCHO in black and white (legend has it that he did it just because it was cheaper at the time), but Van Sant makes no apparent attempt to use color effectively. Indeed, at times, his PSYCHO is so bright and chipper it hardly seems like a suspense drama at all. I don't necessarily think Hitchcock's PSYCHO had to be in black and white to be great, but it is great partly because of the richness and texture of its black and white cinematography. Van Sant's version isn't bad because it is in color, but because he puts no thought into his use of color -- indeed, the film looks better with the color tuned off on the television. The original PSYCHO is often thought of as being a director's film, a work whose success is primarily based on Hitchcock's style. But to see just how much the actors contributed one need only compare the cast and the casting of the two films. Anne Heche has none of the sexuality of Janet Leigh, but worse she plays the part like some spaced-out little flower child. She's neither sexy nor smart. Vince Vaughn finds none of the child-like sweetness of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, instead Vaughn plays the part with a giggling creepiness; you distrust his Norman from the start. Heche and Vaughn are just terrible; her performance has no weight, his has no depth. William H. Macy does a credible job as Arbogast the detective, but he has none of the presence of Martin Balsam, who made the character seem indestructible. Even Viggo Mortensen comes off as a pale imitation of John Gavin, who arguable was one of the stiffest actors there ever was. It says something when the only honest and colorful performance is given by Chad Everett; the one-time TV heartthrob having surprisingly matured into a character actor who can find humor and color in the relatively minor role of the aging millionaire whose money is stolen. His ten-minute cameo shows the film's only spark of life. There is nothing really wrong with doing remakes, if the director can find a new spin on the material or make it relevant to a new generation by taking a new point of view. But some films have reached a level of perfection that makes any attempt to improve them just plain foolish. I can only assume that Van Sant saw his PSYCHO as a noble experiment, an opportunity to see if he could walk in the master's footsteps without stumbling. But, if he really respected Hitchcock's work, he could have shown it by using Hitchcock's techniques to create an original work. Red Skelton once quipped: "Imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery. It's plagiarism." Van Sant's PSYCHO isn't even that, it's colorization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless, lackadaisical vanity project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This shot for shot remake of the Alfred Hitchcock movie is remarkably pointless. There is a great postmodern concept behind the idea of remaking a classic like PSYCHO but Vant Sant's efforts are so lackadaisical that whatever intentions he had for this project were unceremoniously shot down by the fact that everyone involved looks positively BORED. Even the direction feels bored. There's no zip or life whatsoever in this copy of the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. For example, the scene when Julianne Moore is in the Bates home and sees Norman running towards it, and she decides to go to the basement, is amazingly flat. In the original, the tension and suspense was amazing. In the original version, when Vera Miles sees Perkins running towards the house, Vera is shocked and for a moment we can see her trying to figure out what to do next. She sees the staircase that leads to the basement and we feel that she has nowhere else to go but down THERE. In the tension-free remake, Julianne just tip toes to the basement as if it was all a game. Wrong, wrong, wrong!The direction should have been tighter and more lively. As it is, the whole concept falls apart simply because there's no life injected into this vanity project. And the casting is TERRIBLE! Everyone is miscast, certainly Mortensen, Heche and Moore, who, again, like so many other of her roles have showed, few directors know how to direct her or know in which role to cast her. Moore just stands out like a sore thumb. All in all, a failed effort on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know what Gus Van Sant was thinking. I have three words for this film, minimal work possible. This contained the exact same stuff, only a little faster. This film had absolutely no need to be updated. Remakes rarely live up to the original. The only thing that would make a movie more modern is that they might do a little swearing, have modern clothes, have modern cars, and show a little nudity. It does not reflect the story. Hitchcock's unique style was copied poorly, some was removed, and other stuff was done to make it look like Hitchcock. Hitchcock's unique style with mirrors was copied poorly. The style with doubles was removed. Hitchcock intended for Sam and Norman to look like twins and to create the confusion, Van Sant got rid of that. He also got rid of Marion and Lila looking alike, which was also intentional of Hitchcock. The suspense style was copied poorly. On the mother's closet, Van Sant added a mirror, that made it look like Hitchcock. . I could say that if Hitchcock ever saw this movie, he would die again. This remake was pointless and an insult to the original. Psycho is the first movie of Hitchcock's bird series, which contains Psycho, The Birds, and Marnie. The original one was a masterpiece of Hitchcock. This one just goes and insults it like anything could be better than the original. Well, Gus Van Sant should stick with what he does best, dramas. Overall, I give this movie a 0 out of ten. This was completely pointless.</fullReview>

Anne Heche looks like a strung-out druggie in this movie! She probably doesn't even know who Janet Leigh is!Everything about this movie is a disgrace.

I can understand remaking a film shot for shot, as an interesting film exercise, but not using the script word for word. The only thing that makes this film tolerable, is the use of Bernard Herrman's original music score. This isn't art, it's a Zerox copy. Worse, it's a poor facsimile. If you copy the Mona Lisa, the original is still priceless, and all you have is a reproduction. I'd have more respect for this production if they tried to be different and unpredictable. This looks like amateur hour, when compared to Hitchcock's version. Enuf said, enuf time wasted on this flem.</fullReview>

That is not fair nor to KING OF THRILLER Alfred Hitchcock nor to all viewers that will go and "try" to see this movie. This movie is one of the worst horrors I've ever seen and original is one of the Best. Why ? First Psycho was and still is, was cause of comparing to the time when It was made one of the most terrifying films that was made at the time. I heard from elder that have seen it in the cinema's at that time that it was mind blowing, great suspensful horror, but this cheap, faggy film is nothing but a loads of tries to fit everyones taste. AHHHHH !Very bad, I am sorry for being this critical but that's the fact. Vince Vaughn was terrible presenting Norman Bates in whose skin Anthony Perkins fit perfectly. Anne Heche was ok, nothing special and Julianne Moore looked like She just came that afternoon to do the scene, completely not into film .Gus Van Sant haven't put anything new and refreshing which should happened if you are UPDATING the original. He just delivers fake essence of terror which Hitchcock perfectly presented. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That even if this weren't a remake of Psycho, and I were simply watching this movie without knowledge of it being based on a far superior predecessor, I would not enjoy it. It's not suspenseful on any level. Vince Vaughn's performance is laughable; does anyone truly think he means any of his lines? I don't think much of him as an actor, but anyone with a brain could have pulled in a greater performance. Hitchcock's original is actually terrifying. Anyone witnessing it for the first time feels as though they're seeing something truly amazing. It's racked with suspense, Anthony Perkins' performance is incredible; he so carefully depicts all of the minor nuances of someone who is both boyishly charming and nervously wrought. Whenever I watch the original, I get a sense that there are so many levels to Norman's thinking. In the remake, it's painfully obvious that Vince Vaughn is not being remotely dimensional. In the end, I'm absolutely fatigued by remakes. Is there any real point to them? Does anyone believe these directors and producers aren't just trying to bank in on something that was formerly successful? There are thousands of bad movies; those are the films, which are in dire need of being remade. Leave the good movies alone. The new ones are never improvements. It proves without a doubt that Hollywood doesn't have an ounce of originality, since it seems incapable of creating something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all: To remake a Hitchcock movie is a really bad idea. Maybe if you make another adaption of the idea behind the movie or something like this, but to remake shot for shot is really a waste of time. This makes the movie bad enough, but the director added some lousy actors to make this movie really a stinker: Anne Heche will make you scream in pain! First of all she looks totally unattractive with her ultra-short hair, her odd mimicks and odd way of dressing in this movie. The actor who play Norman only gets on ones nerve with his unbearable nervous ticks. The only good actor was the guy who played Marions boyfriend (Vigor Mortensen I think was his name): he is really hot-looking, altough his hairstyle is somehow unfitting. The shower scene is simply boring, but the relief to see Heches last scene in the movie is quite big. That they where to lazy to compose a new score and just revamped the old one which only clashes with the new images, is also quite ridiculous in my opinion. Avoid it, watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could Hollywood stoop so low? Isn't it enough that they take every film they make and slap a sequel on the movie screen just to make money? Now they have to take the most brilliant film ever made and try to duplicate it. First of all, Gus Van Stant is probably the dumbest man behind the camera today. He acts like he's honoring the late and great Alfred Hitchcock and his best piece ever, but really he's insulting it. Now, let's get to the acting and the cast.First of all, Anne Heche thinks she's the stuff as she trys to make a hip version of Marion Crane. I don't think she could've been worse, but then I should never underestimate an "actress" who turns in crap like this. She looks cheap and trashy in that gaudy clothing. Looks like someone's been picking in the bargain rack at the thrift store. At least Janet Leigh (whom I admit I didn't give her the credit she deserved for her performance, you'll agree if you've read my review-i've realized what i wasn't seeing back then) had class and she made Marion Crane likeable. Just look at Hollywood's reaction:Janet Leigh won a golden globe and an oscar nomination (i think she should've won the oscar), Anne Heche gets a Razzie award nomination for WORST ACTRESS.Vince Vaughn was better as the notorious Norman Bates. I appreciated how he made a character of his own, instead of trying to copy Anthony Perkins. It was smart to add the little masturbation sequence while he watches Anne Heche undress (this must tell you it's been a while since he's seen a real woman in person). That's what would happen these days. It would've been cool if Hitchcock put that in, since Psycho was very sexual back in it's time.Viggo Mortenson does just fine here. He's just as good as John Gavin was in the original, since John Gavin wasn't really a standout performer in that film.William H. Macy did well and matches ALMOST matches the talent of Martin Basalm, but not quite.Then there's Julianne Moore. Did she really want this part? Yes it's good that she made her own character instead of trying to mock Vera Miles. She's probably the most talented actor/actress that's in the film, along with William H. Macy. Was she having trouble finding work? This material is by far below her abilities. She went from Boogie Nights, to this.By the way, the voice of mother was awful. I could do that with my nose plugged. POO!!! The camerawork was awful as well as the directing. Some of the worst ever!!!1/10</fullReview>

The shower scene is more gory but that does not save this remake from being a waste of money. Another bad sequel would be better then this. It's watching the same movie with different actors.

		<fullReview>And it's virtually guaranteed that Hitchcock is. This movie is a poor imitation of the original. The original "Psycho" may not have been the utmost of a psychological thriller, but the remake was a joke. Poor unfortunates all over the country who haven't seen the original are touting the remake as a 100% copy, scene-for-scene, word-for-word, idea-for-idea. Nuh-uh!Anne Heche was tolerable in the role of Marion Crane, but Vaughn just wasn't even funny as Norman Bates. The whole point of the original was to set Norman up as the quintessential tragic hero. Vaughn is nothing more than a creepy, perverted little loser who lives with his mother's corpse. He has no personality, no zing, and no depth. Even Leonardo DiCaprio, over-used and under-talented as he is, would have been a better choice for the role.Why even bother remaking the film? Did we really need a close-up of a dead Anne Heche with stab wounds yet no blood? An extremely graphic (as well as audio-enhanced) scene of Vince Vaughn masturbating while watching her in the shower? A shot of Viggo Mortensen's derriere and a semi-shot of something that usually nets movies an NC-17? The original was just fine without them.Van Sant seemed to think that the public was ready for "Psycho" to be released again. Why not just re-release the original? They've been colorizing pictures for years -- if that was their major worry, I'm sure they could have managed it. We didn't need to see Norman Bates ruined by a bumbling Vince Vaughn, who managed to turn Perkins' sympathetic Norman into a the ultra-creepy village idiot. I find it interesting the two films managed to be so close together in the length of the picture, since the second movie seemed to obsess on things that never happened.The only thing this movie is good for is tape space for something else. Sheesh, even "Psycho III" was better than this junk, and it was the worst of the lot. I shudder to think who they'd cast in Norman's role should they ever decide to remake "Psycho II". Maybe the character might look a little more like Perkins did. Perkins WAS Norman -- Vaughn's a guy who makes a great creep, and works okay in an action, but he should never be cast in a sympathetic role. He can't carry it off.</fullReview>

Van Sant used the original shooting script with a few minor revisions (to fit the present time). I thought that this was just another person trying to make more money off of a movie that had been made earlier, but this is different. The eerie resemblance to THE Psycho (camera angles, music, lighting) is perfect in order to add yet another element to the whole Psycho experience. What amazed me the most was that although 90% of the audience had seen the original, they were being startled and scared by things that they knew were going to happen. Van Sant did a great job on this film, and I feel guilty now for getting the wrong idea about this film before I saw it. This is definitely the best horror/suspense movie made in the last 5 years, barely edging out Scream.</fullReview>

Nobody can doubt that Gus Van Sant is a truly gifted filmmaker - I'm writing this after "Milk" - so how can it be that remaking a classic like "Psycho" shot by ,virtually, shot, Van Sant fails so miserably. Not an ounce of what made the original what it is, makes it to the remake. Every wrong choice found a home here. Anne Heche? Who thought of it? She is so bad with that unbearable little voice, one kind of wants her to die. Julianne Moore makes her Vera Miles part a butch, unattractive character. Viggo Mortensen, an actor I love, is kind of embarrassing as is William H Macy in the Martin Balsam part. The wardrobe is unforgivable and Chris Doyle, one of the best living cinematographers, creates a flat, painful, jarringly colorful frame but the worst of all is Vince Vaughn. Absolutely unforgivable. What a terrible, terrible performance. The exact opposite of Anthony Perkins where everything was intensely personal. Here it feels like a Saturday Night Life sketch, one of the less fortunate ones. I haven't been able to forgive Vince Vaughn. That silly, shallow giggle he gives to Norman Bates, will return to haunt him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always heard that this was a terrible film. I thought to myself, 'Hey, it's a shot-by-shot remake of the original, how could it possibly go wrong?' Think of it this way: a person goes to a play on Broadway, and is blown away by the performance. This same person then goes on to watch their high school - no, elementary - niece or nephew put on the same show for their school. On top of that, make it flu season. That's about how I felt watching PSYCHO, except I couldn't laugh like I would be able to at a bunch of sick kids doing Broadway.Where should I start...? How about the performances. They all felt like poor imitations of the originals, with one exception: Vince Vaughn acted like he was juggling between poorly imitating Norman Bates and Rain Man. Then there's the overall feeling of the film. Think of an especially terrible Hallmark film.Overall, it's a poor imitation, except now you get get to see Norman pleasure himself. Yeah....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst remake in history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake is a disaster. It may look like it would be a good remake but it's just a disaster from start to finish. There is so much there too. it's from the director of Good Will hunting and Milk. It's got a fantastic cast. But I had the same problem with this film as I did with The Omen remake. There was only one or two differences between the original and the remake. I liked The Omen remake, but they needed a bit more new to it. Well, the Halloweeen remake had many differences. There was a total change in plot, but the movie still sucked. It was another example of a terrible remake. The Psycho remake is just plain terrible. It felt like you were watching the same movie all over again. Except in the remake, when Marion is getting into the shower, he is masturbating and Marion's sister is a lesbian. At least they try to change it up a little bit, but of course they drastically fail. Perhaps someone who has never seen the original will think this movie is amusing. But Hitchcock's version kicks this movies's ass. Psycho is just a terrible attempt to try and recapture the beauty and creepiness that was the original Psycho. Please watch the original. If you want to watch this crap over the original, I have a tip for you. If you want to watch this version instead of the original version, I insist that you watch the original version. Because if you've seen the original, then you've already seen this terrible film. I have one more thing to mention before i'm finished. What the hell were they thinking when they casted Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. That's a terrible idea. Vince Vaughn is a good actor but he's terrible in this. Everything about the Psycho remake may sound good, but trust me, it's not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's Psycho is a masterpiece. This isn't. Hitchcock's Psycho is timeless. This defines its era: unnecessary remakes. While I'm on the subject, a remake is made to tell a good story, perhaps even to try to make it better, but stand on its own. The 1998 Psycho failed miserably at this. It is a scene-by-scene remake, the most ridiculous concept I've ever heard. The script is the same, the music is the same, the sets are the same, the camera films at the same angles, and the actors of 1998 try to mimic the actors of 1960. So pretty much this is the exact same as Hitchcock's classic, but bad. The acting is bad and the cinematography is bad, because nobody can repeat Alfred Hitchcock. They should have just colorized 1960's Psycho. I guess the cast and crew of 1998's Psycho achieved one thing: they made something that was so good so bad. At least this film did not tarnish the original.</fullReview>

What a lowlife. Not only did he destroy this movie, but he destroyed the chances of seeing a real remake.I'd like to see a new Psycho film that goes back to the original source. For instance, In Robert Bloch's novel Norman Bates is a fat, balding, middle aged man who decapitates Marion Crane!Gus should have put that in his movie, the selfish, self indulgent creep!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when movie classics are usually remade, it's sometimes a re imagination, a rip off, etc. normally in a remake there's new things in the story that weren't in the original film. NOT GUS VAN SANT'S VERSION OF PSYCHO!!! this was the biggest disappointment in film history, and i'm glad it won the razzie for worst remake. this "film" was a shot-for-shot, line-for-line, scene-for-scene imitation of the original Psycho. here are three things from the film that were a major disappointment 1. the cast of the film was just atrocious. it starred well known actors, like Anne heche, William h Macy, Julianne Moore, etc. whenever they do that in a movie, you know it's gonna suck, because the creators try to use well known faces in Hollywood to draw you away from the shitty movie. which brings me to my next point. guess who plays Norman Bates? Vince Vaughn. I'm not kidding. Normally, i'd think that would be dumb because no one can replace Anthony Perkins, and because Vince Vaughn is known for his comedy films. but now there's another reason. HE SUCKS. in this film, Vince Vaughn does the worst imitation of one of the most famous characters in horror film history.2. the credits. Bernard herrmann did the original score, but he wasn't listed in the credits for the original soundtrack, which is just selfish because the creators deliberately ripped off his original music and used computers to make it sound brand new. Robert Bloch (the writer of the original 1958 novel) wasn't credited in the writing credits either. now in the special thanks section, you'd think they'd credit Hitchcock, Leigh, Vera Miles, Perkins, or maybe the original film's producers. Did they? No, the only credited Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who was in the original film for not even ten minutes. that's real generous.3. The death scenes. the shower scene was exactly the same as the original, every shot, except it was more graphic, and anne heche was horrible at imitating Janet Leigh in that scene. arbogast's death scene wasn't only graphic, but it was also stupid. in the original, he gets slashed in the face once, and then falls down the stairs. in the remake, he gets slashed in the face three times (he doesn't even show shock or surprise), and in between the shots of his face slashed, there are 2 three second shots of a hot naked blonde woman and a goat/cow/sheep/ whatever. when he finally falls down the stairs, it's done in blue screen (which is stupid because this was 1998 and there were way more superior special effects then, as there are now.) when he lands at the bottom of the stairs, "mother" follows and starts stabbing him off screen (just like the original). however, in the remake, arbogast's moans and howls in pain sound like he's having a hard time taking a crap. if some guy dressed as an old lady was stabbing the life out of me, i'd be screaming my a** off.BOTTOM LINE: to fans of the original who want to see this movie, DO NOT SEE IT. you will be very disappointed and angry that one of Hollywood's most horrifying classics was trashed like this.</fullReview>

The only thing that was really different about this film is the horrible masturbation noises included when Norman Bates is watching Marion Crane through the peephole in his office! Why doesn't Van Sant just flash on the screen "Norman Bates has sexual feelings for this woman!!!" This is truly geared for mainstream America, and was obviously only seeking profit.

		<fullReview>I tried to watch this one night and fell asleep (it was that slow and boring). I re-watched it the next day and was still disappointed. Aside from the Viggo gratuitous nudity, this movie is almost unwatchable. The acting and direction is bad, the filming is worse, and the soundtrack is the worst I have ever heard. The casting is atrocious. (Especially Vince Vaughan as the lead! He has absolutely no subtlety to his acting style. And the strangely placed peals of laughter only made him seem silly, not scary.) Every single character was mis-cast.At least, this would have been my review if I hadn't watched the original the following evening. After seeing the original, I have to say this version is even worse than I previously thought.The dialog is *exactly* the same as the original (including a modern verbalization of "Well, I declare" in a heavy Southern accent) and even the music score is almost identical (I think they just re-made all the same background music). The original movie is subtle and intense, frightening and realistic, with a sense of impending horror. The acting is impeccable and the score is perfect (since it was made at a time when that music fit). And, of course, Anthony Perkins is amazing in the lead.Even if I had expected an exact rip-off of the original movie while watching this version, I still would have hated it. It was just plain bad. I got a second opinion (I watched both versions with my brother) and we were spellbound with the original, while we actually found ourselves gritting our teeth through this version.The only question I have is... Why did they set this version in modern day (or at least it seemed like the cars were current, etc) when they were going to use the 60's dialog *and* the 60's music? Please don't waste your time watching this drivel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Opinions on this are a matter of religion: I believe this to be literally true because images reach so deeply in the psyche and persist so.My own belief is that the original formed a template not because it was good, but because it was original. Consider that there are only a half dozens stories anyway, and almost all of every film is not a copy of life, but a copy of some previous film. The best copies rely on the fact that you are replaying the original in your mind, so they get that for `free' and can overlay their own message. Hitchcock's set a new template. This film is lucky enough to reference that template.It is rather like IMBD comments. What's so great about writing these is that we -- both writer and reader, though strangers -- have shared a rather intimate experience: the writer can immediately assume a couple hours of a shared life. We annotate that shared experience.In the case of this remake, we have a homeopathic commentary -- the closer, the more powerful the differences. Here we have actors that are in most cases MUCH better than the originals. Heche isn't a deep actor, but she is masterfully cast. However, Macy and Moore are famously multidimensional. They act more than one film, more than one character at a time. Moore is rather a whirlwind as she brings this annotative style of acting to several films a year.So we have annotative acting where we can see two movie performances at once and groove off the resonances because of the near twinning. A large example: here the sex object is played by a lesbian, her sister IS a lesbian, and Norman is not gay: all a rather large shuffle of the underlying sexual dynamic. A small example: when first Macy encounters Norman outside the office, see how he needles Norman both as his character the detective and also as surrogate viewer. Another: when Heche is driving, we get a far deeper performance from her face -- she projects her mind on her face for the benefit of the viewer, she becomes both the character and the character's annotator. Way richer than the original. Anything Moore does exists in two spaces.This film was set up for later annotation, in fact is structured in that very way. The first half, we have the real story: the theft and murder. The second half we have a second film, which overlays the first. Following that we have a more narrative annotion: the `explanation.' (Which incidentally is tedious in the original, much more efficient in this version.)We also have a completely different film cinematically. Hitchcock's camerawork was clever in its time. But today we have so much more we can do with the camera that a close watching of how he choreographs his eye, it seems slow, dull, passive. I'm not an admirer of van Sant's work generally, but this new film is very intelligent in its use of the eye and the motion of color. In this case, the film is quite far from Hitchcock's, and to my mind the changes are emphasized by their differences. The result is a hyperselfaware eye.Close, annotative jazz acting on a familiar script, and colordancing distance in the eye make this a pretty rich experience. If you are serious about film, you really must see this. If you worship Hitchcock for some reason, then you are likely to be an unhappy viewer whatever you see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** out of ****I'm ashamed to say it, but prior to 1999, I'd never seen the original Psycho before (cut me some slack, I was barely 13) so I actually got to see this scene-for-scene remake first. Unsurprisingly, viewing it with fresh eyes that had never been laid upon Alfred Hitchcock's original, I enjoyed it greatly (had this not been a remake, it would've been an easy *** 1/2), but certainly not without the realization that all the credit on a visual and auditory level-the camerawork, the atmosphere and mood, the score-belongs to the original.For those who are somehow still unfamiliar with the plot, a brief summary is in order. Marion Crane (Anne Heche) is a young secretary who makes an impulsive decision to steal $400,000 in cash from one of her boss' rich clients. Hoping to use this money to get her lover, Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen), out of debt, she makes a quick getaway out of town, trading in her car to avoid the authorities.On the second night of her drive, it's particularly rainy and she's almost about to fall asleep behind the wheel so she stops at a quaint little place off the main highway called the Bates motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), is a quirky fellow, but seems nice enough. So Marion stays the night, but finds herself somewhat concerned when she hears Norman arguing with his mother up in that big house of his. And she sure as hell isn't going to like his mother when she's upset.I'm not exactly sure how to review the film. Considering I saw this before the original, I want to approach this as I would any other review, to talk about what I liked and didn't like, but because it's a scene-for-scene remake it's practically begging for comparison and criticism.In certain cases, remakes are far superior to the original (Gore Verbinski's The Ring was even scarier than the Japanese Ringu), but that's typically because the films they're based on had some major flaws to begin with that could be corrected on. Is Hitchcock's Psycho flawed? Actually, it is, but they're only minor quibbles. There really is no reason to remake a movie as superbly directed as Psycho so I'm not sure what Gus Van Sant was trying to prove. He's always been known as a fairly gutsy filmmaker, perhaps he just wanted to test the limits of his `boldness' and see how far he could go in remaking a classic without getting literally butchered.There are two major aspects in which this new rendition stands apart from its predecessor. The acting is the most obvious and I'd even argue that Van Sant's version is slightly superior to Hitchcock's in this regard. The performances are overall excellent, most every major performer adding some new touches. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore, in particular, are better than the previous actors in their respective roles (Vera Miles had Moore's part, but I can't remember who played Loomis in the original). Mortensen gives Loomis an appropriate laid-back attitude and Moore, in true 90's fashion, is a take-charge chick who won't take b.s. from anybody. William H. Macy feels perfectly natural as private detective Arbogast and Anne Heche is actually about on par with Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. Her role requires little more than to make us feel sympathetic toward her situation and Heche accomplishes the task with little trouble. In a small but vital part, Robert Forster proves much, much better than the original actor with the same role; Forster is more relaxed and confident.But the most important role is Norman Bates and the casting choice here is a bit of a backfire here. Anybody who's seen the Hitchcock version knows the marvelous acting job of Anthony Perkins. It's hard to live up to these expectations, and while I wouldn't say Vince Vaughn was vomit-inducingly awful, it's not a very good performance. Vaughn is constantly obsessed with playing the part as inanely quirky as possible, to make Bates as unsubtle a weirdo as possible, just shy of telling everyone `I'm a complete freak!' as opposed to Perkins' natural and disquieting performance. Just as debilitating ist he fact that Vaughn's performance feels like obvious acting. The little tics apparent in Norman's behavior appear more as if Vaughn is simply pretending to have such little quirks rather than genuine eccentric acts. When Vaughn states, "mother isn't feeling well," it sounds more like a parody of Perkins' performance than an oddball man with no social skills. Even if I hadn't seen Perkins' take, I'd still be dissatisfied with Vaughn's portrayal.The film is obviously visually different from its predecessor, but it's also pretty fantastic in this regard; the addition of color accentuates a familiar, yet slightly different atmosphere than the original, and some of the retro costumes and sets are fairly amusing, if not also a bit distracting. It's also nice to hear Bernard Hermann's wonderful score left intact.The question on hand is whether this movie is really worth recommending. Unlike most viewers, my `untainted' eyes had a great time watching this suspenseful and wonderfully creepy thriller, but the same goes for the original. Give this one a shot if you've never seen the original, but watch Hitchcock's version just to see where the filmmaking brilliance originated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Gus Van Sant is remaking the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic or more accurately copying it. Marion Crane (Anne Heche) is sleeping with married Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen) and steals $400k from work. She starts to get paranoid. She stops at a roadside motel manned by Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) with mommy issues. She gets killed in the classic shower scene. Her sister Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) goes to Sam looking for her followed closely by private investigator Milton Arbogast (William H. Macy).What's the point of this? There are no surprises or tension. Van Sant is using so much from the original that it becomes a filmmaking exercise. The music and many of the shoots are copied right out of the original. This may ultimately be nothing more than an exercise. It may have uses in film or acting classes. Anne Heche's paranoia is compelling although Vince Vaughn has a tougher icon to overcome. The various minor changes in this one can be debated academically but this has no movie-going value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to once again check in at the Bates Motel. This time, I'm not that psych.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent surge for anything 'Psycho' thanks to the 2013's 'Bates Motel' television series, let's take a peek through the peep hole at the 1998 remake of Psycho! When I first heard that Universal Studios was remaking director Alfred Hitchcock's iconic 1960's horror film, "Psycho" with Director Gus Van Sant. I was really looking forward to a new take on it. Maybe, it would go back to the classic story by author Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was in turn inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. Who knows, maybe this film to reintroduce us, to the original idea of Norman Bates. The middle-aged, overweight and balding man with glasses from the story. Sadly, it does not. There was barely anything new, done. Although this version is in color, features a different cast, and is set in then, the present day, 1998. This remake is, of course, famous for, not only simply replicating Hitchcock's Psycho's content ?i.e.: its script, and ? with this ? also its corresponding themes, music, moral framework and "message", but also its identical "frame-to-frame" camera shooting. Both movies tells the same story of a female embezzler, Marion Crane (Anne Heche) arrives at the Bates Motel, only to find out that she has walk into a serial killer's den. Can Marion Crane survive the night or will Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the first Psycho is a generally highly critically respected as a work of art, allowing a set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films at the time. This movie doesn't really stand out, in the harsher, gorier &amp; sexual charge environment of the 1990s slasher film genre. Honestly, if the remake kept the low-key black &amp; white visual style, I would think this movie would stand out, more, due to the lack of films, using it. They really could had used this film noir style more. It would give the film, a German Expressionist cinematography style that reminds us of early silent horror film. Better yeah, the filmmakers should had interjected black &amp; white visuals for any of the scenes, featuring the Bates Motel, and color for anything else. It would really set the mood, with the use of shadows and spooky dark backdrops. It would look something, like how 1998's American History X was shown. Since, they didn't do that, they should had really capitalize on making the colors, stand out! The film should had used vivid primary colors, particularly red, in creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting. Something more out of 1977's Suspiria. Yes, while the choice of colors detracts from the narrative because of their brightness and boldness appear intentionally artificial and unnatural, creating a sense of intellectually contrived camp. It really could had gone into 1994's National Born Killers in its outrageous acid trip style. Sadly, it doesn't even go that far. While, the movie is indeed, Rated R. In many ways, it's a lot tamer than the original black &amp; white film. Yes, the murder sequences are also intercut with surreal dream images, but it's far too quick to be that noticeable. For this to work, the movie should had shown more nightmarish imagery, shown, more skin, and more blood, but it doesn't. It could easily, be rated PG-13 in how nongraphic, it was. Since the movie has no direction on how to set the mood, besides coping the old film. It built no good suspense or tension. The main actors and the supporting cast in this film, weren't that memorable. The supporting actors in this film, are mostly forgettable. I really forgot that Julianne Moore &amp; Viggo Mortensen was in this film. William H. Macy's performance in this film was a bit cartoony with his Dragnet look, and acting chops. He looks something out of a G-Men 1950's crime show, than anything else. Anne Heche's Marion Crane comes across as simply "too light-hearted" to make us become truly involved with her plight. She never once conveys the emotional weight or likability necessary for us to believe in her as the human center of the film. Vince Vaughn in the other hand, his Norman seems neither innocent enough, nor threatening enough, to convince either as pity or fear from the audience. However, it's not as bad, as critics make it out to be. One thing that sucks about his appearance here is that Vaughn's height and broad shoulders mean he lacks any child-like or womanly qualities. It's pretty easy to tell the different between the real Mrs. Bates and him, dressed up in drag. People often criticize Gus Van Sant's choice of actors, due to his openly gay beliefs. There is, in fact, some cogency to the argument since Van Sant has managed, hire openly-lesbian Anne Heche as Marion, and the butch, straight man, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Critics argues that, by casting a decidedly straight actor as Norman, Van Sant is rejecting the potentially homophobic jest inherent in Hitchcock's original casting, while Heche's status as a lesbian deflects the heterosexual male gaze away from the most sexually objectified female character in Hitchcock's cinema. Add to this, is the fact that the movie does reversal of the nudity in the opening bedroom scene, where a man's bare behind rather than a woman's bare breasts. Another example is the sickening display of heterosexual voyeurism as Norman spies on Marion while, masturbating. While, these critics have a fair case for the value of Psycho as a queer appropriation of a previously 'straight' film. For the most part, this movie still quite inferior, as it never truly address that complexity in sexuality studies in depth. Overall: Is this replicate film, really that deserving of all those harsh criticism? My answer to that, is yes. This remake isn't worth taking a stab at. See the original, instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat daring concept bungled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1990s, critical darling Gus Van Sant was coming off the huge success of Good Will Hunting and could have picked any project he wanted. Surprisingly, he made the ballsy decision to remake Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho in a "shot-for-shot" production. The response was divided between the outraged and the curious. The curious to see exactly what the end results would look like. The former rightfully noting that Psycho is a rare film that actually holds up grandly and there was little, if any, way to improve on it. Hitchcock's signature flourishes were so integral to the film and its accomplishments so legendary that using the old nutshell that modern audiences/generations who had never seen the original seems foolish because it is a film so popular and enduring that modern audiences/generations could so easily view and experience it. Van Sant's defense that Hitchcock lamented that he was unable to direct the film in color and include nudity because of the censors of the time is true - although that does not necessarily make it a suitable defense for Van Sant to remake it.For myself, I was a bit curious. The remake starts well enough. We get the familiar Saul Bass title sequence with Bernard Herrmann's legendary score (has there been a better score in a thriller?). The opening is pretty much exact with the camera panning into the hotel room of Marion Crane and Sam Loomis after a lunch time tryst. The only difference now are the actors and a bit of nudity offered by Viggo Mortensen (as Sam). The film stays slavishly faithful through Marion's temptation, her embezzlement, her flight from the city and her fateful rainy night stop at the now notorious Bates Motel. It is after Marion's stop that the film starts to falter, slide and never recover. The film remains fairly faithful - but somehow bungles the shower murder - the timing somehow seems off. And what in the world is the story with the inserts of nonsense footage, for instance a cow crossing a road? While directorial decisions definitely weaken the film after the one-third mark, casting decisions mar it even further, making us realize how important good casting can be.From the good to the bad: I am not a fan of Anne Heche and a number of people do not care for her interpretation of Marion Crane. While I prefer Janet Leigh's take on the part, Heche definitely acquits herself well and has a viable take on the role. Whereas Leigh was compelling and hard-edged and a bit calculating, Heche is softness and light, and truly comes across as a woman swept away by a moment's weakness, who is then terrified to find herself in over her head. Her approach is definitely different, she has put some thought into it and it actually works within the context of the film, although arguably not as interesting as her predecessor.No one will debate that Viggo Mortensen on his worst day is a better actor than the wooden John Gavin (reportedly a studio-induced thorn in Hitchcock's side). That said, I am uncertain that the decision to play Sam as a cowboy-type bumpkin works very well. Similarly, Julianne Moore filling in for Vera Miles, as Lila Crane, Marion's sister doggedly trying to find out what happened to her, is disconcerting. I always liked Miles, but her performance is not one of the more memorable aspects of Psycho. That said, Moore plays the part like a bull in a china shop. We do not have much fear of anything happening to her because she comes off not just like a woman who can take care of herself, but a woman who could conceivably bite the heads off of an army. This dilutes the tension in the final moments of the film. The normally reliable William H. Macy seems equally miscast as the ill-fated Detective Arbogast, whose killing Van Sant also manages to botch.Worst of all is the casting of Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. I have no idea what anyone was thinking. Vaughn, best known for playing paunchy schlubs in criminally unfunny comedies, would seem vastly ill-suited for this part...and that proves to be an understatement. First off, Vaughn looks like he spent a few months at the gym prepping for the role, and instead of getting the thin, reedy unassuming Norman Bates a la Anthony Perkins, we get an overly-muscled guy in too-tight sweaters to show off his biceps that looks like a serial killer. Acting-wise, Vaughn is a disaster. Perkins provided an edgy nervousness and unassuming vulnerability to the part with a dose of nebbishy charm and just a hint of menace. By contrast, Vaughn is charmless, vacant and dead-eyed. When the film has its big unveil of the identity of "Mother" it seems laughably unlikely that Vaughn's Norman could have that many personalities rolling around inside because he cannot summon up so much as one personality for the camera.While watching the film in the theater and seeing it slip away from Van Sant thanks to questionable directorial decisions and foolish casting, I thought of something truly Hitchcockian that obviously eluded Van Sant. What if he were to have announced that he was providing a shot-by-shot remake of Psycho and kept stressing that to the media, kept the opening third with Marion's arrival at the Bates Motel exactly as is...and then come up with something completely new and audacious from that moment on to completely blind-side the audience. That may well have been something Hitchcock would have done and gotten away with. Apparently not so much Van Sant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marion Crane is a secretary whose boyfriend, Sam Loomis, has troubles paying off a debt. A rich client of her boss buys a house with $400,000 in cash. Marion steals the money and heads to live her dream life with Sam. When she gets lost in a bad storm, she stops at Bates Motel, where owner Norman Bates, lives a very troubled life with his mother. A week later, Marion has vanished and no one can find her, not even Sam, her sister, Lila, or a private detective who has been hired to find Marion and the money........I like this film, simply because I can detract myself away from the classic and enjoy this for a standalone movie. But take heed, it takes a lot of patience and several viewings to get into a state of mind to do that. It's pretty difficult.Yes its pointless, and Vaughn is woefully miscast (where was Steve Buscemi?), and the magic has gone from the whole surprise of the film. So now instead of expecting that cop to turn up at the motel, you see Remar in a pointless cameo playing possibly the weirdest cop ever committed to celluloid, whereas in the original, he was a brilliant red herring whom the audiences were tricked into thinking that he'd be a main character.But the film gets five stars for effort, Van Sant has tried to emulate Hitchcocks genius, but sadly missed the target by miles. Because the shock value is no longer there.But, I still like the film. Moore and Mortensen are brilliant and even Van Sant has the audacity to put a lookalike of Hitchcock in there as a reference to him doing cameos.But I can totally understand the hate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, many have called it pointless and dumb but just after seeing I called it weird. You are a handful of movies that I have seen so many times that I have not only memorized the dialogue but practically the dance of the dialogue. Hitchcock's Psycho is such a movie. I know it so well that I know the actors mannerisms by heart.This made the insufferable remake of the Hitchcock classic seem baffling. The dialogue in 1960 is repeated here and somehow it doesn't work in a modern setting. The actors know the words but have none of the realism that set the classic movie in motion.So many things go wrong with this remake that I don't know where to begin. The first is the miscasting of the two leads. Vince Vaughn is too burly an actor to match Anthony Perkins birdlike mannerisms. I would have cast Jeremy Davies who played Private Upham in 'Saving Private Ryan'.Anne Heche is a fine actress but she lacks the cold, sexy demeanor of Marion Crane. I would have cast Ashley Judd because (with all due repect to Anne Heche) Judd acts with her face and that's what this part needs. Not to mention she bears a striking resemblance to Janet Leigh.Here is a better idea . . .It's easy to say that this movie should never have been remade, but my suggestion would be why not base the story soley on Robert Bloch's book (which was different in a lot of ways). That way we would have a different spin on the story and wouldn't have to wonder why a exact remake was necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but completely pointless remake of Hitchcock's classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are nothing new in the film industry. Ever since the beginning of cinema, filmmakers have been turning to vintage films to create their own works. Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's 1960 masterwork "Psycho" takes a different approach. This one is a "shot-for-shot" remake. Van Sant uses Joseph Stefano's screenplay, Bernard Hermann's iconic score, with a new cast of actors, color photography, and attempts to copy the original's camera shots and editing. This is an interesting idea that, unfortunately, doesn't work. Hitchcock purposefully shot "Psycho" in black-and-white in order to give the film a gloomy atmosphere and to make sure that it didn't come off as too gory. While Van Sant's "Psycho" isn't gory, it certainly isn't gloomy. Shooting this story in color takes away the edgy quality of the original, and this movie plays it too safe. Van Sant mentioned that some audience members don't like black-and-white, which I understand, but complete color doesn't work for "Psycho" (maybe if the color scheme was more subdued, it would have worked).The performances of the four leads are quite bland. Vince Vaughn, attempting to put his own spin on Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, falls flat. Right off the bat, he comes across as creepy (Perkins made the audience unaware of what lurks beneath Norman Bates' surface, which made him all the more effective). Anne Heche plays Marion Crane as if the film were a romantic comedy, which it certainly isn't (Janet Leigh gave Marion a sympathy which Heche doesn't even attempt). Julianne Moore's Lila is annoying, and seems to think that shouting all of her lines make her sound angry (Vera Miles took a more subdued approach which showed Lila's fury and tiredness). Viggo Mortenson is completely boring as Marion's boyfriend, and is forgettable (John Gavin was more memorable). William H. Macy is the only one who comes off well as Arbogast, the private detective.Is the film really bad? Well, not really. Danny Elfman's adaptation of Hermann's score sounds great in stereo, but lacks the edge Hermann gave in the original. Some of the supporting cast comes off well, but the whole affair comes across as flat and tired. If you don't compare it to the original, I guess it could be slightly better, but when you try to copy an excellent original shot-for-shot, it becomes hard to do. This film is similar to going to see a hit Broadway musical, and getting the understudies at your performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to see the point of this movie. I really don't like remakes, and I didn't know why they made a Psycho remake, but I decided to give this one a chance as well. No let me say it this way, this is a remake take to literary. This is basically just the original Psycho if it had been made or if it had happened in 1998. The story, as well as the dialog is 95% identical to the first film. There's a little bit more blood, the sexual themes aren't hidden as they used to be in old films, and there are some minor references to modern day life.So I find it hard to both like and dislike this film. It's very good, but only because the original film was very good. it's direct copy, so it's also bad. Of course there are some improvements. like you'd expect from a newer film. butt hen again even the intro is the same as the original, only with new names. So i repeat, I can't rate this film, because I can't tell if it's bad or not. By definition it's both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My own take on why this largely didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was roundly bashed when released around the Thanksgiving period of 1998,and while I cannot say that this film was a roundly abominable as was popular to say after its release,it's still not a particularly good effort and a VERY pale shade of the original.If this show works at all,it is because director Gus van Zandt doesn't mess with it AT ALL. Nearly shot-for-shot,with dialog not touched much at all,the story is kept in tact and,as such,that's why this has ANYTHING going for it. You may know the story of Marion Crane,a late-twenty-something investment firm secretary whose affair with married Sam Loomis drives her to abscond with $400,000 of investor's money,ends up stopping at an out-of-the-way rural California motel due to fatigue and heavy rain,and then goes "missing". She's tracked by her sister Lila and boyfriend Sam,as well as business-hired PI Milton Arbogast. The trail takes them to the motel of shy,seemingly pleasant motel keeper Norman Bates,whose bizarre behavior and loyalty to his mother covers much more sinister and violent behavior. This story is so ingrained in the public consciousness,and the compelling and tragic behavior of the principals involved is something that stands for itself.What fails this movie,to me,can be broken down in three ways:first off,I know it's been said before but casting is pretty shaky,not so much the minor characters(Philip Baker Hall as a local sheriff,William H. Macy as Arbogast or the actors playing the car salesman or dogged state trooper trailing Marion)but the major characters either seem misplaced(Anne Heche is far more grating as and seems unsure of how to play Marion;Vince Vaughn's Norman doesn't seem sure whether he wants to be the charming,nervous "Oh that CAN'T be him!" Norman or as a straight-up,chilling and creepy sociopath;Julianne Moore's Lila seems to be affecting a little TOO much aggressiveness;and Viggo Mortensen's playing Sam as some sort of sexually ambiguous southern-fried player just feels wrong somehow). Secondly,the movie choosing to go shot-for-shot,with few if any script alteration,chooses to make it clear that this film is set in present day 1998,yet the making of that movie,and indeed the character qualities and conflicts are SERIOUSLY couched in 1960,thus creating an odd conflict of trying to make a movie that truly feels forty years old in terms of male/female relations,social mores and even in some of the devices or machines(I could swear that Marion's cars look more like those wide steering wheels and flat interiors of late fifties automobiles!)and yet pretends to be casually in the "now";thirdly,given the amount of reverence the original commands(and I would be among those who would share it),a shot-for-shot remake with different actors playing the characters is almost inherently set to be a comparative study and as such will probably reflect badly upon the actors in the new movie. In short,it's a situation for the actors that is almost inevitably set to fail.This movie might,MIGHT have worked if it were done for a smaller medium--cable TV would be my posit--since it would suggest tribute yet wouldn't be so hubris in its thinking it could ever have a relationship to the original that would merit it being played on the big screen like its original copy. However,the desire to ape the original,without any creative attempt(aside from small touches from Van Zandt,which then come off as merely tacky or pretentious)by the new filmmakers seems like little more than an overstuffed homage to Hitchcock. It's not bad to look at or watch,but its far too indebted to its original and off of an effort to be anything more than a curiosity and/or a desire to just re-watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capable remake of classic Hitchcock movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 2/11/2009 ? 5 out of 10(Dir-Gus Van Sant): Capable remake of classic Hitchcock movie, but was it really necessary? This is a hard movie to review because it wasn't that badly done, but it wasn't really a whole lot different than the original and the magic kind of gets lost because you're comparing every scene. Gus Van Sant directs this movie more like a homage than his own work. He used the original music and very similar initial credits. Most of the movie is exact as far as the screenplay and the filming except for some minor extra blips and views during some scenes. One obvious extra addition is when the sister of the original killed character mentioned that she needs to get her "mp3 player."(Of course, this device wasn't invented yet in 1961) Other than this, the only other changes were a few extra shots in the shower scene, a change in the year of the event(1998 instead of 1961) and an unnecessary addition of the original Anthony Perkins character, played this time by Vince Vaughn, fondling himself while watching thru the hotel room hole in the wall. The movie is scary and Vaughn does a good job with his character, making him a little more sinister than the original. The movie, though, really doesn't stand on it's own because it's really "not" it's own, if you know what I mean. It's OK as a homage, but do we really need a homage when we can watch the original in excellent quality on DVD?? I guess this question really can't be answered but the film is not trash, just not that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot for shot remake of Hitchcock's classic film, is an unnecessary remake that we did not need. If you seen the original PSYCHO, then trust me, you've seen PSYCHO 98', the only difference between the two is that director GUS VAN SANT has went a bit further in a couple scenes in terms of sexual content. The story like in the Hitchcock classic has a thief, MARION CRANE taking off to see her boyfriend SAM LOOMIS, with $400,000 dollars she was supposed to deposit in a bank. On the road one night, she leaves the main highway &amp; spends the night at the Bates Motel, where she meets a shy, down to earth nice guy, named NORMAN BATES who's "Mother" watches from the house, in her upstairs bedroom. Crane bites the big one after having a change of heart about going through with her plans to steal the money, meet with Sam &amp; run away together. However before she can fully redeem herself of her trespass, she is stabbed to death when she decides to take a shower. When Sam &amp; Marion's sister investigate her disappearance (&amp; that of a private detective that was also hired to look for Marion &amp; wound up meeting "Mother" after entering the Bates home) they both discover some very shocking secrets behind Norman &amp; his "Mother". What made ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S 1960 suspense classic PSYCHO, such a landmark in film history, was because for one, Hitchcock really crossed the line &amp; broke some taboo's within the Hollywood system. PSYCHO was a one of a kind movie at the time, a cleverly written shocker that toyed with the audience's expectations, while delivering a gripping suspense thriller. PSYCHO offered up, cross dressing killers, a toilet being shown (blasphemy!) a girl in her undergarments, a girl taking a shower on screen, good acting, directing &amp; a surprise twist ending. You never knew what to expect from that film. PSYCHO 98' doesn't break any new grounds or taboo's in the Hollywood system (Not that there remains much now anyways) it's just an experimental re- enactment of the classic film (i.e. what PSYCHO would have looked like if Hitchcock would have made it today) Now don't get me wrong, this remake is not a total loss, the acting was still good &amp; VINCE VAUGHN, I thought, did well in the role of NORMAN BATES (But say what you will, ANTHONY PERKINS is still better), but the house was no where near as spooky looking as the one form the original PSYCHO series &amp; because this is a shot for shot remake of the original, there's no surprises or suspense, no shocking taboo's unfolding in front of our very eyes, no clever plot twists, nothing! I mean sure if Director GUS VAN SANT had did PSYCHO a lot differently giving it a radical change in story &amp; content, it probably still would have been bashed, but you could have at least applauded him for trying something new, trying to take the original premise &amp; update the film for modern times, but since he didn't, you have to ask yourself what's the point? In short, don't see this movie, it's not horrible, but why watch a shot for shot recreation of a suspense classic, when you can watch the far superior film it copies? Perhaps the biggest mystery regarding PSYCHO 98' (besides the filmmaker re-doing it shot for shot) is why he dropped shots of cows &amp; thunderstorms during the murder attack sequences?** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Have A Peep.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I agree that the remake of "Psycho" was not the most amazing film of the last century, did anybody really think it would be? Let's just have a peep at why we should have seen the warning signs before either: a) spending our $8.50 on the admission price or b) spending our $3.50 to either rent or pay-per-view the film.Number one: just look at the director. Here, you have GUS VAN SANT trying to match ALFRED HITCHCOCK. I mean, not to diss Gus entirely, but he probably wouldn't of been as hounded if he would have tried to put a fresh spin on the story. Alfred laid down the groundwork, now improve upon it if you can, not copy it. (Plus, I mean, it IS Gus, who in my opinion, is just a mediocre director who got lucky with "Good Will Hunting".)Number two: look at the actors. People who have seen the original "Psycho" have emotionally attached themselves almost to the actors who originally portrayed the characters we know. Let's take, for example, the most IMPORTANT character, Norman Bates. Everyone LOVES Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman. He was shy and innocent, yet was so tortured within and sad that he really made us believe he was a psycho. Now, let's look at the latter, Vince Vaughn. Now, I LOVE Vince Vaughn. I think he's an awesome actor and probably one of the most UNDERRATED around. Now looking at his work in the "Psycho" remake, did I think he did an AMAZING job? Not exactly. But in his defense (well, somewhat) how could he when the director he was working with was just copying the original film? (And another thing, if the actors had actually tried to copy their performances (which they didn't do, thank God!) wouldn't they be getting bashed like Gus because they too weren't original?) Not that I'm trying to apologize for them though. For the new actors trying to win the place in the original movie fans' hearts, they needed to do KNOCKOUT jobs in their roles, which, none of them really did. Sure, they DID try to be different, but they didn't really take their characters down routes most of us would of liked to have seen. And finally Number three: the colorization. We all KNOW how creepy it was to see black and white images of violence in the original. Colorizing it seemed to take AWAY from the shock value actually. We see red blood every day in different movies, but we rarely see it colorless. To me, in black and white, the blood swirling in the shower was actually scarier because who knows how red that blood is running. (Morbid yes, but hopefully you catch my drift.)In the end, all of us original "Psycho" fans should of been able to take these three signs as warnings that this movie probably wasn't going to be as good as the original. But could this somewhat smarmy remake really even compete with Hitchcock's masterpiece in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema vs Theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first reaction to hearing that Gus Van Sant was going to make a shot for shot, line for line remake of Psycho was probably the same as yours - WHY? After several years, however, I did see the Van Sant remake on TV and had a bit of a revelation. Theater is a medium where actors and directors essentially take the same play and try to find different ways to interpret the source material. No one suggests that it is arrogant to put on Twelfth Night again, just because it has been done before. In fact, seeing how different actors use the same dialog is part of what theater lovers love about live theater. Why can't we view films the same way? Why do we meet cinema with a blanket rejection of this idea? Granted, movies are much more costly, which is probably why this kind of remake has never been done. But I do think that, in a perfect world, it would be quite enjoyable to see all of our favorite movies reinterpreted from time to time from the perspective of different actors and directors, not to try to outdo the original, but, simply to provide a different slant on the material. Did I like the remake more? Well, no...who would? Psycho was a perfect movie to begin with. But I did feel excited and energized by this particular concept of a remake.</fullReview>

All I can say about it is bad, just plain bad! Gus Van Sant is an OK director, but this was just a mistake! The whole feel of the film upset me and I thought the scene here Norman masturbated cheapened the film, Hitchcock alluded to it with much more class. This Psycho did not flow as nicely as the original and did not have the same feel. I know that the original version didn't have the present day special effects and the scene with Arbogast falling down the stairs was a little campy, but it was the 60's. Hitchcock's version is a classic and people should not be allowed to mess with it. If you want to see a masterpiece, watch the original, if you want to see garbage or if you want to make fun of something, watch this version!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is totally surreal. First off, the original dialogue seems jarringly anachronistic, as do the costumes of some of the characters, for example Arbogast's hat - it looks ridiculous in this film, but had to be included because it was a major feature of the very first shot in which he appears.[--- POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ---] If you're a real fan of the original, you'll find the fact that every camera shot is copied from the original but not as well executed a complete distraction. Even more distracting are the one or two additional camera shots that serve no function whatsoever, such as the random sky shot during the shower sequence, or the shot of a stag on a highway during the Arbogast murder sequence. [--- END OF SPOILERS ---]I've seen the film twice now and the only redeeming feature I can find is the very opening scene, which is a flight over Phoenix straight into a hotel room - apparently in one take, which is I guess probably what Hitchcock would have like to have done if he had had the technology.If this film were made by a first year film student, you might just about forgive it, but really Gus Van Sant should have known better, and I'm being charitable here because I really don't think much of any of his other films.Like almost everyone else who has reviewed this film, all the way through you will be asking "but what is the point?".</fullReview>

Sam became the dumbest piece of meat since hamburger (with hints of being him gay; I mean, could you be more obvious with him holding a Judy Garland album?). Through the whole thing I'm asking myself, "What the f--?"The original film had its dumb parts. The acting wasn't brilliant but it worked. Some of the rear screen work and readings of mother's lines were laughable. But it had a real human connection with its characters.

Macy, Phillip Baker Hall, Robert Forster, and Anne Heche as Marion Crane.It's just the same exact plot of Psycho(1960). If you've seen the original before this, then there is no point of watching this. You know who the killer is, you know whats going to happen. Although, I'd rather watch this than Psycho III. If I were you, I would at least watch the original first then watch this and compare the two.1.5 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 4.6/10Rated R for Graphic Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: 1998 remake of the 1960 classic finds the ill fated bank secretary Marion Crane making one last stop at the Bates Motel after stealing some money from her employer's client. Marion has a run in with the hotel's eccentric proprietor, Norman Bates.The Review: While I certainly can't refute Tedg's argument of this "Psycho" remake, I'm just putting my own two cents in. I saw the original, thought it was great, and now I see this, and I don't think it's a great film. It sounds weird for saying that, well believe me, I do think it's weird. I can't say I disliked this film either, because that would direct disrespect toward the original, which strangely, and not particularly original, is a shot by shot, near word for word remake of the Hitchcock film, that just didn't seem necessary. Why would Gus Van Sant, hot off his oscar nomination, decide to direct a remake of a film that's virtually untouchable. It's obvious that when you try to remake a film, there are inevitably going to be comparisons. But you shouldn't remake a film that still leaves an impact on contemporary movie audiences like "Psycho", because regardless of what you try to do, the original will always eclipse the remake.This film is literally, one giant anachronism full of characters that seem as if they'd stepped off a bus from the late fifties, early sixties, and started living a normal, everyday life in the near Millenium, as they did in this film. The costuming, the dialogue, it all seems to go back to the original which I'm unsure of, might be a tribute, or a faithful recreation because of the remake. The casting is decent, although I always thought they could've gotten other actors to fill the roles. Nicole Kidman was offered a role in the film as Marion Crane, and I think she would've been a better choice, although Anne Heche was pretty well cast. Vince Vaughn, while a great actor, didn't seem to pull off the timidity that made the Norman Bates character so memorable, not to mention his physical frame. I think a person who would've been able to pull the role off much more convincingly, would be Jeremy Davies. It also seems to me that Joe Mantegna may not have been a bad choice to play Detective Abergast for the sometimes wisecracking detective who sees through and through, or George Clooney in the Sam Loomis role, but I'm speaking my mind and this is only an opinion. I will however say, that the casting of Robert Forster was an ideal choice as the doctor.Other than that, I praise Van Sant for taking the courage to remake the original, and I don't think it was his intent of making it a one upmanship competition, but more of a tribute to Hitchcock. Unfortunately, I don't think audiences nor critics understood his intent to honor the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel compelled to comment simply because there are so many STRONG reviews about this film. Personally I am not enjoying this movie. I'm about half way through. I'm glad I paused to see what others think, because I will be much more interested in the second half. Obviously the film is an act of love. it defies expectations in the most peculiar ways. It certainly does not seem interested in offering entertainment. From what I can see, the biggest offense to viewers is the peeping scene, although there have been several renovations of the orginal, all sly, and all of the kind of slyness that Hitch would have loved. Hitch loved to shock. He thought Psycho was the funniest film he ever made. If you have watched Psycho by Hitchcock and tried to see the humor in it, watching Van Sant's with a flexible mode is not impossible. I do believe Hitch might have gotten a laugh out of the audience reaction on this site. One thing Gus didn't do was try to imitate Hitchcock's direction, and there's a lesson right there. I probably won't suggest anyone watch this film, however I am now going to go finish it and enjoy it so much more in the knowledge that it provoked such a vehement response in so many viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When William Castle made "Homicidal" in 1961,he was blasted for ripping off Hitchcock. Even Stanley Donen and Brian DePalma didn't get the flack for imitating the master. Now this line for line remake of Psycho comes along. Ugh! The cast is game but the director hits every dramatic point on the head with a fervor that would make John Wayne cringe. Poor Vince Vaughn is so weird=ass acting from the start, Anne Hecht would run screaming back to her car. The original film emphasized people trapped in their lives,anxious for a change. This pooped out piece doesn't even hint at it. The color photography is bright and unreal,the direction erratic and dull. Even the final shot of Marion's car is ruined by a long,drawn scene of people standing around.If you really want to see a good version of Psycho,buy the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The topic title pretty much describes it, but I'll explain why I think it is so. Be warned, there may be spoilers. Read at your own risk.The 1998 Psycho is pretty much a shot by shot remake of the 1960 original, but it does it in such a two dimensional manner as to completely destroy the mood the film is supposed to draw you into.I have never been fond of Vince Vaughn, and his acting here is a perfect example why. Anthony Perkins played Norman as this shy young man with this deep rooted evil lying just beneath the surface. Perkins had such wonderful unstable stability you actually believed the character. Vince's performance comes off as if it was intended to mock that of Anthony Perkins, like a dark comedic version. Not only did it come across as a mockery, you could almost literally see Vince slogging through the performance. Anthony Perkins was a scalpel, Vince Vaughn was a hatchet.I saw no improvement or even decent imitation acting from the '98 actors over the the '60 actors. In fact, most of the '98 actors seemed to think there was a fire and thus had to charge through their lines at top speed. Even their movements seemed clip and forced. And why in blue blazes does Julianne Moore's character go back for her 'Walkman'? What the Hell? Aren't we worried about poor little Marion? Yeah, let's go back and get our Walkman. If it was a gun or car keys I could see it, but a Walkman?? Geez.If this was a college production, I would give it a 6. If this were an original film from Hollywood, I'd give it a 4. As a Hollywood film AND a remake, I give it a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julianne Moore's Irritating Walkman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In Memory of Alfred Hitchcock" read the final caption. The preceding two hours demonstrated that Gus Van Saint should have undergone deep hypno-regression therapy. But it wouldn't have done him any good. Remembering and mimicking the genius of a great film maker does not immediately imbue you with his innate gifts. It's more likely, as Orson Welles wisely pointed out, to inhibit your own creative development. But then, what did that hack know?So Gus gets to play Hitch for a couple of hours and fulfils his childhood dream, Hollywood squeezes a few more drops of box-office blood from the Psycho franchise, and Joseph Stefano gets paid all over again for a forty year old screenplay. At least I hope he did. It was and is, mostly, a great piece of work; literate, poetic, compassionate, and nightmarishly funny. However, the new cast, seemingly less practiced in the subtleties of their craft than in the imbibing of fresh orange juice and nasal Ajax beneath a hot blue California sky, butcher it. Shakespeare spoken by am-drams sounds like guano. Nuance is eroded, emphasis is misplaced, meaning is lost. Stefano may not be a Shakespeare, but he gets similar treatment from this troup. They seemed to have wandered in from a whacky, campy sitcom. Jerry Seinfeld playing Norman Bates would have been much more frightening.The original cast's interpretations and performances have only been elevated by comparison. Vaughn confuses camp for Perkins' neurosis, Hecht confuses skittishness for Leigh's world weariness, and Moore confuses hostility for Miles' determination. William H. Macey, a very good actor, comes off with some credit but he's up against tough competition. In the original film, Martin Balsam's single, extended scene with Perkins displays both actors amazing sensitivity to subject and character. The tension is brilliantly captured by Hitchcock's chiaroscuro camerawork. In the update, Macey comes close, but it takes two to tango, and Vaughn ain't a-dancin'.Van Saint directs shot-for-shot scene recreations most of the time. He misses a few tricks though. Hitchcock's highway patrol man is much more sinister, for example. Occasionally, Gus slips in a few home-made grace notes; surreal, flash-frame cuts from the murder victim's POV. Most critics hated them along with the rest of the film. I found them startling and actually quite effective, mainly because of their sheer unexpectedness amid the relentless dross. They hint at better ideas inside the directors head; ideas all but frozen to death in Hitchcock's shadow. Other critics regarded them as exhibitions of Van Saint's boredom.It's a pity that Van Saint didn't completely succumb to boredom and offer up something more playful, subversive, and revisionist in the way Scorsese did with his Cape Fear remake. But Van Saint is too constrained by the holy grail of Psycho 1960, and as such, Psycho 1998 "doesn't gel, and if it doesn't gel it isn't aspic..." or as this version puts it for no very good reason, "it isn't jello".And, of course, Julianne Moore's Walkman is extremely irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uh... okayyyy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I learned from this garbage is that, like Mike Nichols, Gus van Sant owes all the heaps of praise he received at the peak of his career to the great Buck Henry, the masterful screenwriter of Nichols' wonderful "The Graduate" and Van Sant's famous "To Die For."Many people here have stated that "Psycho" needed to be updated. Uh-huh. Why don't we just take off the Mona Lisa's shirt while we're at it? That way it'll appeal to modern audiences. Let me tell a secret to those who choose not to spend much time with intelligent people: There are a lot of teenagers, and individuals of any and every other age, who understand that works of art like those produced by Mr. Hitchcock, the greatest director of all time, are ageless. Only a person with no sense of reverence or taste would honestly think any classic film needs to be "updated."As for someone's suggestion that this should become a recurring trend, and that "It's a Wonderful Life" should be remade with Harrison Ford in the James Stewart role, well, that's a pretty insulting remark to both Stewart and Frank Capra, both of whose achievements are untouched by pretty much anybody in Hollywood today. It's too bad that Ford can't act his way out of an invisible box unless coupled with Spielberg or Peter Weir, and that's more a testament to their talents than anything else, 'specially since Weir even managed to pull a good performance out of the ludicrous Robin Williams.Vince Vaughan actually isn't bad as Norman Bates, but his performance doesn't really fit the character, since he takes away much of the horror of Bates by making him outwardly nuts. Then there's Anne Heche, whose sheer name gives me an instant migraine.At least the awful "sequels" to "Psycho" had the good sense to be funny. My score: 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Near 40 year old remake of the milestone film, with some poorly cast actors in roles they weren't meant for. The film follows the original, with a bored secretary having stolen a large sum of money from her boss' client and heading off somewhere she doesn't know. Until she arrives for one last stop at Bates Motel with a caretaker who seems all too normal in a house that's all too creppy.The Review: "Psycho" strikes me as the kind of film where everybody working on the film, walked away asking "Why?" with only the director knowing that answer. I can't say I hated this film or disliked it, because in truth, it is disrespectful to the original. The "Why?" question comes into effect with this just being a reproduction of the film. A $25 million reproduction at that. Van Sant's film is literally shot for shot, word for word, everything verbatim down to the very last hand gestures of it's characters. He doesn't bring anything new to the material that's been given here, and only works from the base without exploring the possibilities. I think Van Sant wanted to reintroduce "Psycho" to a whole new generation, and the marketing of the film is fairly smart, but it doesn't offer much. It's only contribution is really just a waste as it doesn't prove anything. The cast, filled with some very talented actors, are wasted in some miscast roles. Especially lead Vince Vaughn, who makes it very, very hard to believe him as Norman Bates and it just simply isn't good. His 6'3 frame beats out Anthony Perkins in the physical department, and he just doesn't work. Neither does Julianne Moore whose character feels as if she's just stepped out of a sweatshirt factory. The film itself, is one giant anachronism with the characters from the sixties being transplanted into the nineties. Who knows if Van Sant was going for some kind of kitschy look to the film, but it doesn't work one bit. The mode of dress is off kilter in many ways and makes it one of the many subtle distractions that drive this remake off track. Van Sant is a masterful film director, but this isn't his forte, and if he's trying to make it that, pick something that 's not a classic first.Grade: The Remake: C+ The Original: A</fullReview>

Why not just rerelease the original Psycho? I would LOVE to see the original on the big screen.Anyway, back to the new version. I've only seen it once, when it first came out, so I've certainly forgotten quite a bit. The one scene that I do remember well is when Norman was peering through the hole in the wall at Marion undressing. The sound of him masturbating really took away from the scene, and was a perfect example of what is wrong in most movies today -- very little is simply left to the imagination. We KNOW that Norman is very aroused, but are sound effects really necessary? The moral of the story is: You don't remake a Hitchcock</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely will I make such a presumptious comment, but here I must. This movie is so unbelievably bad and totally unnecessary it defies comprehension. I needn't elaborate on why, just read any of the negative reviews shown on this site.In essence, I will say Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the great films of all time. Every element from time to bottom (at least in the first half of the film) is perfection. To see this "reshot" with modern trappings, garish color, a vastly inferior cast, and none of the intangible magic and subtlety of the original is a dismal experience indeed. The last time I saw Psycho 1960 I took special note of how absolutely marvelous was Janet Leigh. Anne Heche, by contrast, is a joke. I didn't even find this movie interesting as an oddity or an academic exercise; rather, I kept wishing I was seeing the original.Why would van Sant make this movie? As an interesting academic exercise or experiment? That's fine, but he should have kept the results from the public! All he has proven is that Hitchcok was a genius, and he is not.What is really sad is that there are so many young people, who will prefer this, or who don't even know about the original. "It's in color, it's got blood, Heche is HOT, blah, blah.. And to the unfortunate minority of critics (including to my astonishment - The New York Times!) who think this can compare in any favorable way to the original, you really need to find something else to write about it, as you obviously know NOTHING about movies! </fullReview>

Vince Vaughn makes a HORRIBLE Norman Bates, but hey, he tries. And Giving Viggo Mortenson the part of Marions boyfriend was terrible. But.. William H. Macy does a nice job as the detective. Julianne Moore at least tries her best in this, but on a scale of one to ten of giver her a 7. But the shower scene was just the most poorly directed scene I've ever seen. I mean it's not like the shower scene in the original was scary or anything, but this one was just terrible. And another thing, this could've been better if they didn't repeat every line from the original word-for-word. They could've changed some stuff around.

		<fullReview>I don't think remaking a classic is a bad idea. I don't even think remaking a classic with almost every line identical to the original is all that bad an idea either (although I would advise against it). But what this new "Psycho" did was simply a disgrace. The only reason to remake a movie with almost identical dialogue as the original is to interpret the movie in a different way than the original did, or add something to the original. This should require the actors to deliver some of their lines differently than the original actors did to give them a different effect or meaning. But in this new "Psycho" all the actors generally do is repeat the lines in a different speed or pitch without giving any new meaning or effect to them. Many of the characters are more artificially exaggerated than the original. It's also apparent that the new actors didn't have a feel for the performances, and the performances often seem forced. In general, this movie did NOTHING for the original. There are even many problems outside of dialogue. The graceless Anne Heche, who plays Marion, is not convincing as someone who could create such a rush in Norman that his mother would get jealous. In the original "Psycho," Janet Leigh was very pretty, very alluring, and had a kind of teenage sexual naughtiness. And Vince Vaughn isn't convincing as a man who got any rush from Marion. In addition, in the original "Psycho" Norman was intended to look like a man who seemed too friendly to commit murder so the audience wouldn't suspect him of it. Anthony Perkins pulled that off pretty well, but the moment you see or hear Vince Vaughn you want to just stay the hell away from him. Let's just hope they don't try "Psycho II," but if they do at least it's almost 20 years away.</fullReview>

See Armageddon, it's about as smart as letting Joel Schumacher make Batman 4 after he did an amazing job of messing up Batman 3.This re-envisioning is pure garbage. It's a colorized version of a movie that is the peak of both horror, suspense and thrill. The new version hires actors that lack what the original cast had, and the color adds pretty much nothing to a movie that was shot in black and white because that's how the director meant for you to see it.Unlike Hitchcocks plan to get people to watch the whole movie, the remake should undo that, and you should feel free to LEAVE as soon as the previews are over (in case you're waiting to see that extra-special Star Wars: Episode 1 preview that you can download at any computer in a home near you).So- remember: color, new actors, new scenes, remake: BAD original B&amp;W, old actors, old thrills, Hitchcock style: GOOD, VERY, VERY GOOD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find nothing wrong with this movie, even though most people criticize it immensely, but what I want to know is why did Gus Van Sant completely waste his time by filming it? The original was so inventive and unheard of for 1960 that its considered brilliant.. and is. Did Gus Van Sant think a scene-by-scene replica right down to the camera angles would pay tribune to Hitchcock? or help his career? Filmmaking should be about understanding your own thoughts and ideas and match them with a story. Was he afraid of being criticized for not being able to capture the erie, terrifying style of Hitchcock? I would prefer to see something as pointless as Tank Girl if atleast it reflected the directors ideas or personality. It's not as if people that havn't seen the old film can't go find a copy and watch it. No one needs a remake just to expose people to a masterpeice, its not hard to find such a classic.The acting is equally matched in the remake with the exception of Vince Vaughn. Anthony Perkins was absolutely perfect as Norman Bates, a Lanky, strange character with a boo-radley demeaner. Vince's acting was more awkward then Perkins but not in a good way, he made the character looks like a teenager afraid of getting cooties from girls then someone threatened by outsiders that might expose the fact that his mother is dead. Vaughn's acting doesn't near capture the psychotic style of Perkins.If you can't find old movies or don't like black and whites then sure see this remake. But in brief, the remake was a pointless rendition of a masterpeice that didn't come close to capturing Hitchcock brilliance. Whats next, someone going to make remakes of The Exorcist, or A Clockwork Orange?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KEEP THE ORIGINAL UNIQUE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, it would have taken a lot for this remake to come close to the success of Psycho (1960). The original is such a classic that even the best work Gus van Sant could provide, wouldn't please the critics. This movie was so bad when it came to recreating the horror - this won't frighten you. The attempt to make the slashing scenes believable didn't really work. For 1998, the slashing scenes in the shower and when the detective is attacked on the stair case was pretty bad. The original Psycho is still pretty eerie with the black and white colouring. It would have been good if Gus van Sant had made this more gory (like Scream), even if it meant the UK certificate was an 18, not a 15. Plus I can't stand the actor who plays the detective - he just has this persona that he's such a comedian. He didn't fit into the serious role. However, it's not that bad on the whole. If you loved Psycho (1960), then this is watchable as it's (obviously) more modern, with the fresh actors (Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche). 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I kinda' liked it... for the viewing experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I kinda' liked it... it was certainly no great film achievement - in fact, it actually seems a little disingenuous that someone would remake such a pedigreed film. It reminds me of how they built a duplicate of the New York City skyline in Las Vegas - just a cheap knockoff of the real thing, and what?, all for the mindless consumption of vapid tourists? Shameless, I say! And yet, if you ever go to Vegas and gawk at this duplicate, you will probably spend a good bit of time carefully scrutinizing it just to see how close it is to the original, how it differs, etc.And so it was with this remake of the original "Psycho" - I hate to say that I felt like a darned tourist, but nevertheless it *was* fun to "go along for the ride", not just to see what a modernized version of the story would look like, but to actually feel compelled to look closely at everything - dialogue, set design, camera angle, etc. (and this is something we often times don't do nowadays with movies - without realizing it we have become oh so passive). So in that regard, though it may not have been a great film, it was nevertheless a very good viewing *experience*. I actually enjoyed the viewing of the film because it kept me quite busy, it forced me to look intently at each scene, searching for shades and nuances that maybe I wouldn't have bothered to look for had the original B&amp;W "Psycho" not been so firmly blazed into my mind.I liked some of the subtle *new* touches that were thrown in (there are several), like the pre-death images that flickered briefly before detective Pendergast died; I especially liked the newly designed underground (cellar) scene, what with it being much larger and neon-lighted, and with the live birds et al. I also liked the set design of the motel - it seemed so very 3-D: for any of you who have travelled across country and stayed in one, the movie will really make you think you are actually right in a motel again. There are many things to look for and ponder in this remake, it has a certain richness to it in its own right. So yes, this movie is at least a good movie viewing experience, you may not *like* it, but still it's well worth seeing and studying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tepid but passable remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some fine effects by Gus Van Zant, this movie just falls flat of what it could have been. The main problem is a very weak performance by Vince Vaughn as Bates, who has none of the timing required for the part of a neurotic momma's boy. Ann Heche isn't much better as a woman on the run. There's just no life in her character. Julianne Moore is a bit over the top as Heche's searching sister but gives a good performance I think. Wm H Macy is the only other bright spot as the PI Arbogast. The supporting cast is also rather weak, with Robert Forster, who was so good in 'Jackie Brown', practically phoning it in as the psychiatrist. I found the famous shower scene quite good and more vicious than the original. The original music was also re-recorded as is missing the impact it should have. Overall it's not that bad of a film, but the actors just don't do it justice, and Hitch would have been disappointed.</fullReview>

It stars Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, and William H. Macy. If you want to know the plot rather read it on the info page or read my review on the original. There are some good things about it though, that is Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore's acting, the creepy images that The Detective (William H. Macy) sees before his death, and better gore, but thats it! I was expecting to see a updated and more modern version of Psycho, but this is just awful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, I think that Hollywood is plum out of ideas. When I think about how every television show ihas been made into a movie, every successful movie has 10 or 15 sequels, and how perfectly good movies are remade, it makes me think that the screenwriters of today are totally dead. Sometimes, remakes and sequels are good. I thought that the remake of Shaft was great. However, not as good as the classic Richard Roundtree Shaft (though Samuel L. Jackson is one of my all time favorite actors, Roundtree in my opinion is the one and only Shaft). Some remakes are acceptable. I think the remake of 12 Angry Men is superior to the original. But, the idea of remaking one of the greatest movies ever made, shot for shot, is the DUMBEST thing I have EVER HEARD!!!!!First off, yes, this movie is a SHOT BY SHOT REMAKE of the original. I ask, WHY!? The story in the remake of Shaft was nothing like the original because they wanted to be original. The only difference between the two Psycho movies is that the new one has different actors and it's in color. Oh, and we get some disgusting sounds of Norman as he peeps on (name here). I do like their choice of actors, though. I like Anne Heche, and she does a good job here. I really think adding William H. Macy as the detective was GREAT. Vince Vahn is good, but he ain't Anthony Perkins. Anthony Perkins is, IS, Norman Bates.In conclusion, I can't hate this movie. This is the original Psycho, just in a different package. I think that Ann Heche and William H. Macy are the only additions that are superior to the original (sorry Mrs. Lee). The only shot that I didn't like in the original Psycho was when the detective falls down the stairs. It looks so horrible and fake, it made me wonder why Hitchcock had it in there. I was hoping they would replace it in the remake. Well, they didn't.One last note: Why remake good movies? Especially movies that everyone loves? Why don't they remake BAD movies? I'm sure Battlefield Earth could have worked. I'm sure The Phantom Menace could have worked. SO WHY DON'T YOU WORTHLESS HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE GO AND REMAKE THOSE MOVIES!?(I am not giving this a rating. It is not as good as the original, and I think that we should all forget that they ever made this remake. They made a remake to Psycho? When did they do that?)Just wait, they'll remake Casablanca. Oh yea, they'll do it. Only, in the new version, Rick will get on the plane, fly to Berlin, and nuke Hitler. Then watch the sequels roll in. Casablanca 2: This time, it's WAR!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Shouldn't Exist (SPOILERS INCLUDED)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS INCLUDED*Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay a homage to Hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and I thought My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting film. The question burning in my mind when it comes to the remake of Psycho is, "Why did you do it, Gus?"In my mind, there are only two reasons to do a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone has thought of a fresh, new approach to the material. Neither one of these factors is at all present in the Gus Van Sant version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color, and there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing imagery relating to the title character's possible inner dialogue (which I found unnecessary), there is nothing new here.Furthermore, I found the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche was okay as Marion, but she lacked a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I didn't feel as sympathetic towards her character, because the choices she faced seemed far less constrained as a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960's. Vince Vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I feel that Anthony Perkins' timing and nervous, haunted look was much more effectively creepy. The only performance that I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. She was excellent as usual, and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character.To be fair, there is some beautiful camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson. And yet, during the whole film I had this irritating sense of deju vu. Haven't I seen this somewhere before? Oh wait, I HAVE seen this somewhere before! Nearly every scene seems to be copied shot for shot from the original. One almost gets the feeling the director made this film as a school project. "See, I can make a Hitchcock film, too!"If you haven't already, go see the original. It's held up over the years, and beats this bit of mediocrity, hands down. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally agree with Doug McClure saying people only focus on the failure to improve Hichcock's classic. People like me. Gus van Sant has disgraced film history with his pathetic remake of a film that changed everything in everyone. Vince Vaughn gives a minor, inferior "performance" that can (would) hardly even be credited with any actor other than Vaughn. Heche is too scared, too tiny to be Crane. The rest of the cast, even the brilliant Julianne Moore sucks in her role. The only remotely improved performance is thus of Viggo Mortensen. His bad-boy face and body-language is perfect. In the original, John Gavin seemed too gentle, too neat to cheat on his wife. Not Mortensen. Ha Ha! But this isn't enough to help the poor quality of the film, and the film fails miserably, not just to the standards of the 1960 version, but on its own too. Maybe classic films should not be tampered with, and left alone in its glory. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake has got three problems...1. Gus Van Sant is not Alfred Hitchcock! Of course, Van Sant is a good director, no question! But for somebody, who has qualities like him, its not very praiseworthy to adopt every take, every scene, every dialogue one to one. Nevertheless, Van Sant was not able to transfer the oppressive atmosphere from the original into his remake. The legendary "shower scene" is a disappointment! There are no surprises, no new ideas... 2. Vince Vaughn is not Anthony Perkins! Anthony Perkins WAS Norman Bates! He couldnt get rid of his psycho image for his lifetime. Vince Vaughn is someone whose face I saw on the screen... and then I turned away and I had forgotten him! Anthony Perkins became a legend, Vince Vaughn however is absolutely expressionless in this role!3. Who really needs this movie? Although there are a few hard trying actors like Julianne Moore, Anne Heche or William H. Macy this movie makes no sense! In the age of Playstation and Pokemon the kids and youths watch "Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" instead of this copy. And real friends of cinema prefer the original from 1960 anyway!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...I liked it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie was originally released, I immediately understood from director's comments that this was supposed to be a scene-for-scene remake of the original. I was surprised at the number of complaints at this concept alone. We perform plays in much the same manner...different actors working from an identical script, with only minor modifications in scenery. Yet plays do not receive criticism for this concept, so why should movies?Regardless, the negative reviews had me putting this movie on the back-burner until after it had been out on video for quite some time. I picked out on a slow weekend, figuring I'd only be out a buck-fifty. First a quick comment about the original: I've only seen it twice, thought it was a good movie, and that's about it. All the concepts about directorial genius and trend-setting are lost on me. Alfred Hitchcock is an excellent director, and I haven't seen a bad movie by him yet...though I've only seen three of his movies. So what sort of judge does that make me?Now on with this one: Like the original, I thought it was a good movie...no more, no less...nothing I would add to my video collection, but nothing I would turn off, either. Plot/script: It's identical to the original, so what's to say about one that hasn't been said about another. I will say this: Hitchcock did it first, and that is a vitally important factor to consider, especially since it was done 40 years ago.The remaking: Duplicating Hitchcock's scenes with a marvelous respect for the original. It conveyed the paranoia, the fear and tension that ran through Hitchcock's. Once again, Hitchcock did do it first, but then again, Van Sant is not trying to be original here. He is recreating. The parts added in: The mastrubation scene, that weird little flashing scene of cow and woman as William Macy meets Normans mother neither added or took away, though the latter was kind of unusual. What was it supposed to mean?actors and their parts: Overall, an improvement from the original. Vince Vaughn was a far superior as Norman Bates, completely unsettling and unnerving. At first appearing normal, then disintegrating into his madness as the light of attention remained shining on him. Anne Heche reprised Janet Leigh with the same distracted am-I-working-for-actor-guild-dues that seemed to be present in the original. Juliane Moore did well. Viggo Mortensen was less likable in his part. He came across as amoral bully. I wasn't expecting William Macy to show up as the detective, but when he did I crowed with laughter. He played it straight and did well. Scenes and sets: Some minor modifications, but hardly anything to comment on. They did not detract from the movie, so they did their job. The Bates home was remarkable in its ordinary nature, which, to me, made it even more spooky than the original.Now for the negative: What decade is it? Yeah, we've got modern cars and walkmen. But we have clothing that is decidedly dated, Macy being the most obvious. The sexism seemed more yesteryear. And it had the feel, at least to me, of a 80s horror movie. The combination was distracting, and the only really bad thing I can think to say of the movie.However, the viewing public, as a majority, does not seem to be a fan of scene-for-scene remakes, so I doubt we will see too many more. Which is too bad, as I would love to see fresh faces and modern technology interpret many older movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Sant's Effort Goes Awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best; to remake a true classic, especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And after watching this version of `Psycho,' directed by Gus Van Sant, two things come to mind immediately: What's the point, and what on earth were they thinking? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same screenplay (by Joseph Stefano, taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used. The final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking: First, that a `remake' should be just that; a retooling of the original, rather than a `copy' using new players; and second, that shooting in color, using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film. Although this was a noble effort by Van Sant, ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which Norma Bates was afflicted: The `mind' of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And the twain, though met, shall never be bound. Van Sant, even working from the original script, would have been better off making his own film-- all the way through-- rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. The opening shot of the movie, for instance, and especially the `shower' scene, arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema. Copying Hitchcock, from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain, and using the same `skree! skree! skree!' sound effects-- even as homage to Hitchcock-- again, only distracted from the story. And, if you factor in the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have yet another split in the psyche of the film. Macy is a terrific actor-- one of the best character actors in the business-- and his performance here is excellent; but as good as it is, the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant is doing. So the film winds up with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was watching `House Of Good Will Psycho Games.'  As far as performances go, Macy's was as solid as they come, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who--to put it as delicately as possible-- was simply awful as Norman Bates. His whole performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly at that); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with `spontaneous' bursts of maniacal laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character, altogether unbelievable and pretentious. It gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a `True Incident' you would see on a television show; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from Norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced Peter Graves, intoning, `Such was the mind-set of Norman Bates on that fateful, rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of her car and into his life--' The supporting cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer). If nothing else, Van Sant's `Psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success. Granted, todays era of psycho-babble, `American Psycho' and Hannibal Lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like Norman Bates somewhat; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of dread, that throat-clenching fear, with this film. If ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight-to-video, this is it. Better still, had it never been born. I rate this one 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pity about the House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only one problem with this remake of the original Psycho (1960), i.e that the original house used in the first movie wasn't used, this house lacks the sinister atmosphere of the famous "house on the hill"in the original movie which was also used for the two sequels. Otherwise, I think it's a pretty good remake. I found myself wondering if Marion would indeed have returned to Phoenix had she survived, or continued on her way. What makes both this and the original such good horror movies is the fact that the story starts off quite ordinarily with a trusted office clerk finding the temptation of 500 grand too much to resist and leaving town on Friday afternoon. There's no omens or indications that anythingfrightening is going to happen until she gets to the motel and is clearly somewhat put off by Norman's strange conversation topics. She is first scared then irritated by the cop who woke her up while sleeping next to the road and arouses some suspicion by telling him she's in a hurry, although if he hadn't woken her up she'd still have been asleep longer. When he keeps watch on her at the garage the viewer gets to think he's going to be her problem, not Norman Bates. I don't wish to make a comparison between Vivien Leigh and Anne Heche,or between Anthony Perkins and Vince Vaughan, I think both duos played their parts suitably well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that the classics should be left alone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend and I decided to have a Psycho-fest, and watched the original Psycho and the new Psycho back-to-back. As film majors, we were so impressed with the original. It was wonderfully made and a definite masterpiece. Then we turn on this new version of Psycho. It was absolutely horrible. I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a movie. The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. I felt like I was watching a high school play. The casting was equally awful. Anthony Perkins was a cute little innocent guy you wanted to like and trust. But Vince Vaughn seemed like a 40-year-old man trying to be a cute little innocent guy. But he came across as immature and silly and a horrible actor (although he's not). And they made him look like a dirty pervert, while in the original he just seemed like a curious boy who hadn't had much sexual experience. I can't even begin to express my shame for Anne Heche. The movie was almost too painful to watch, and we began to watch the majority of it in fast-forward, only stopping to compare certain scenes with the older version. And one question that we absolutely couldn't answer was `What was the costume designer thinking?!?!' Marion Crane looked as if she just stepped out of the Brady Bunch. I thought this was supposed to be 1998, not 1968. Her hairdo combined with that wretched pink dress gave her the appearance of a streetwalker or transvestite or something equally demented. Sam Loomis must've gotten lost and roamed off the set of a John Wayne movie, and Lila Crane was dressed like a 15-year-old and bounced when she walked like a giddy teenager. And Arbogast, was he a ?90s private eye or from one of those bad ?40s detective shows? The only positive thing in the 1998 Psycho was the detail in keeping shots and timing, etc. the same as in the old. However, this movie was proof to me that the classics should be left alone. Recreating them is, as in this case, a HUGE mistake. I would (and will) suggest to anyone that watching this movie is a complete waste of time, one hour and 44 minutes that you'll wish you could have back when it's over. Rent the old version. You won't be let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure it's not as good as the Hitchcock original, but Gus Van Sant pulls off a good recreation of a cinema classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that in 1998 when I first saw the recreation of Psycho I felt in ways that it was a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's terrifying study of murder and madness of that eerie, run-down motel that we know as The Bates Motel which we all have learned to become terrified of. Still the Hitchcock version is the best along with the acting of Anthony Perkins helped make the 1960 film a cinema classic. The 1998 version had Gus Van Sant use the same script and nearly every scene was done the same. The most striking difference is the color which added more suspense and put more of a modern twist to Psycho. Second the different cast made for likes and dislikes and talk of comparisons. The scene that is most different is when Vince Vaughn masturbates while he looks through the hole while watching Anne Heche undress. I must say that Vaughn is the weak link in Psycho he does not seem original and seems to be very goofy for the part of Norman Bates it seemed as if though Vince was overwhelmed by the part. You miss Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates he played the part so calm and cool. The best upgrade about Psycho is Anne Heche as Marion Crane. I know that Janet Leigh was sexy in her day including the 1960 Psycho, but Anne Heche defeats her. From the opening scene with Anne lying on the bed wearing an orange bra. Then later as Anne packs her suitcase to leave that scene of her in a light colored green bra, it just goes to show how much sexier this Psycho is and more life has been added not only by film standards but by the times. It seems as if though colored bras have become a fixture by all women. Anne Heche was greatly cast as Marion Crane and Anne turned out to be the best thing about the Psycho recreation. This film is worth a watch even though it falls short of Hitchcock, but most people should still give this film a look and look at it as a dedication to the memory of Alfred Hitchcock you will enjoy it better that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant should be ashamed of himself for remaking Psycho. Admittedly if you've read my comments on the 1960 version you will realise that I'm not a lover of Psycho but the original was so well worked, directed and filmed. Anyone who has watched this without seeing the original or knows what happens will have worked out that it was Bates dressed up as "Mother" committing the murders before he fought with Sam. In the original Anthony Perkins was well disguised and viewers didn't know for certain it was him until he fought with Sam right at the end. In this Vince Vaughn's face was fully exposed and just wore a blond wig.Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh were brilliant as Bates and Marion respectively in the original. In this, Vaughn was "too nice" as Bates, with his nervous chuckle and Anne Heche was made to look a dumb blonde tart.Just put the final nail in the coffin (no pun intended), in the shower scene, the curtain is pulled back, the camera is on Heche and she says "oh", then screams her head off. Dear oh dear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched both versions of psycho in my english class to see how different directors etc. interpreted the film. When we watched this one, the whole class was disappointed. First of all, at the beginning of the film, it clearly states that it is 1998. So then why were the characters wearing clothes that were worn in the 1960s? It was all very mixed up, as one minute, there were people wearing old style clothes, the next minute, they were using walkmans and other modern day objects. I think that the whole point of having a remake is to make it the way you want it. Not how the previous director wanted it to be like. The director tried a little too hard to be like Hitchcock, therefore, not only was the film pointless and boring, but it was also confusing. If you want to see 'Psycho', I suggest you watch the original. This version is awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but why was it even made in the first place?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't bad but it shouldn't have been made in the first place. Most re-makes are to tell the original in a different direction. Or, maybe to let the newer generation get a glance of what the original was like without actually watching the original. Whatever it may be, this movie had no point to it.One night I walked into the video store to rent Psycho 2 and since they didn't have it, I thought 'okay I'll see what the newer version of it is like.' I watched it and knowing about everything that was to come, I didn't keep an open mind about it.I am not familiar with Gus Van Sant's work so I can't relate this work to any of his other films. What exactly was he supposed to accomplish? The movie was retold word for word, scene for scene, and basically action for action. No creativity was put into this. More importantly, he didn't have to do any work. So, he pops in the 1960 version and tells his actors to do exactly what they see. I'm sorry, but I could have done a better job than that.The actors I thought did an okay job of portraying the original characters. Since I didn't like the movie from the very first shot (and thought to myself, why did I rent this?), I realized that nothing was going to appeal to me. Anne Heche did a very good role considering that all she had to do was copy Janet Leigh's actions and words. Vince Vaughn, who I had never heard of before, did a good job as well. In my opinion, there's only one Norman Bates and his name is Anthony Perkins.One thing that I didn't understand was why they had bits of modern day shots mixed in with older props. Anne Heche's wardrobe struck me as the 60's style, but it could be both. The motel was recreated exactly the same except for the modern day advertisement sign. The cars were all up-to-date styles, but why did William H. Macy have to stick to the old detective clothing? And one area that everybody has talked about was Norman Bates' masturbation scene. What did that have to do with the movie? It didn't occur in the first one, so don't add something as unnecessary and moronic as this in the remake.Another part that annoyed me was the death scenes. Arbogast's death included a woman in a blind fold along with a farm animal. What is this supposed to represent? Also, the famous shower scene was ruined. The storm clouds didn't have to be added and it wasn't as "down to the point" as I would have liked it to have been. The last thing that I will point out is the Bates' house. If everything was supposed to be down to the exact replica of the original, then why didn't somebody suggest to make it look just a little bit like the real one?Like I said, this movie wasn't bad since I love the original, but it shouldn't have been made in the first place. This was just an easy way for a new audience to open up their wallets to a ludicrous remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the original Psycho(1960) was a masterpiece. Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made. I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color. I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original. But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it? They should have just re-released the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1998 version of "Psycho" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because "it was air conditioning." I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) &amp; Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. The movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you'd think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, once I heard that they would be remaking Alfred Hitchcock's suspense classic, I was more than a bit skeptical. How can you top a movie as good as that? Well, the answer is, you can't! But still, this '90's rendition of one of the most beloved horror films of all time still isn't quite as bad as one would suspect. That's mainly because little has been changed. Joseph Stefano's original script was used and director Gus Van Sant, perhaps sensing what a stir there would be, hasn't strayed too far from it. Naturally, the shower scene is slightly more graphic this time around, and there's an unnecessary masturbation scene, but although it doesn't add anything new to Hitch's most famous film and the most famous horror movie of all-time, one can't help but feel that Van Sant's film could have turned out worse, much worse. Vince Vaughn, a good actor, wouldn't have been my first choice for the Tony Perkins role, but he comes off surprisingly well, that is to say, better than Anne Heche who is severely miscast in the Janet Leigh role. There's not much praise to give the 1998 PSYCHO other than to say "it could have been worse". The '98 PSYCHO is a film that should be seen once just to satisfy the curiosity, after that, do yourself a favor and go back to the original. My personal advice to Mr. Van Sant is "don't tamper with perfection".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been okay on its own, without the flotsam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's "Psycho" was not a masterpiece. That's a myth created by a generation of film writers and professors who enjoyed popular culture when they were kids and were concerned as adults to elevate it to the status of art to befit their newly acquired pretensions. "Psycho" was a good suspense film that became slightly less good as it went on. There is no reason to regard it as sacrosanct. Better films--"Wages of Fear" to name one in the same genre--have been remade without cries of sacrilege. Why not "Psycho"? Van Sant seems to treat it like a seedy crime story, which captures an aspect of the novel's atmosphere that the first film doesn't. But he's hampered by his strange resolution to chain himself to that film.The worst mistake is the reuse of Herrmann's score, which fit perfectly there and doesn't fit at all here; the composer would have been the first to see that. The Hitchcockian moments of surprise--Marion's boss in the crosswalk, Mother in the shower, Mother on the landing, etc.--are all muffed. Polanski or De Palma could have brought them off but for some reason Van Sant can't. In the crosswalk scene we're unclear for some reason that Marion isn't where she's supposed to be. In the shower scene the curtain obscures Mother's entrance a little too much. In the landing scene she appears a little too early, giving the effect of an unintentional glimpse into the wings. The dogged re-creation of the original shot sequence might--perhaps--be meaningful in a different type of film (e.g. a parody, or a remake of a film like "October" that seeks to make an opposite political point); here it was effort wasted. In the dramatic scenes I couldn't have told the difference, and in the murder scenes, where Van Sant could have established most clearly the distinctiveness of his approach, he can only repeat tricks that were designed to work once. In the first film the house was not as well used as it might have been because of the limitations of the set. Sticking to the original storyboard, Van Sant is able to go only a very little beyond that But I thought it a fair movie. Apart from the presence of Macy, who is too much (and in a funny hat, yet), the casting is probably better than in the first film. All the characters have a peculiarly American simplicity that Van Sant seems to understand. In her simple, selfish amorality Marion seems to be part of the same world as Norman. What came across most strongly to me in the playing of the scenes was that everyone was trapped. Why would Marion's boyfriend hector Norman so relentlessly about being trapped if he didn't feel that way himself? Even in their last scene he and Marion's sister are a captive audience, as if in a church or a classroom, forced to listen to unpleasant truths, and Norman is of course imprisoned both physically and psychologically; but then he was all along.However much of this was Van Sant's point, he might have reworked the script somewhat to bring it out more, but perhaps he anticipated that that would probably have led to a mishmash, as it usually does. Whatever his point was, what he loses in his approach is the whole Gothic side of the story. The dread that Hitchcock imparted to the simplest settings is missing, to be replaced by a kind of soulless barrenness. But it's not clear how that gives rise to the horrors, and by clinging to the first film in all the moments when he might have shown us that Van Sant has veered away from the heart of the story, the heart of darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't a remake, it's a counterfeit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fifteen years old when the original Psycho came out. I was also one of the few people who had read Robert Bloch's book prior to seeing the movie and Hitchcock's film exceeded any expectations I had about a possible movie. I held off viewing Van Sant's remake until recently and I was completely let down. In my opinion, the "new" version isn't a remake, it's a counterfeit, with unnecessary color, uninspired acting and, worst of all, Vince Vaughn hopelessly mis-cast as Norman. In the book, Norman is described as large and overweight. It is to Hitchcock's credit that he chose thin, delicate Anthony Perkins for the part. I just can't buy robust, muscular Vaughn in the role of a man terrified of women. The original was black and white for a reason: it set the mood for the dark, frightening corners of Norman's mind. The color simply added the red of the blood, it did nothing to enhance the atmosphere. Even the house was warmer looking and less sinister. Watching the remake made me appreciate the original that much more. It has been my feeling for a long time that Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the four or five greatest movies of any kind ever made. And like all great one-of-a-kinds, it can never be duplicated. Let it stand alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's scene for scene and word for word re-make of Alfred Hitchcock's timeless original is both unimaginative and pointless. I've read other reviews of this movie, and I hear people talking about how this is a good way to make older movies more accessible to today's audiences. More accessible? Are you kidding me? Every video store on the planet carries the original Psycho, is it that hard to go out and rent it? Who cares about today's audiences? I see no reason for anyone to go to any extensive effort to get these ignorant people to watch one of the greatest films ever made. If they are too materialistic to watch a film in black and white, it is entirely their own loss.Re-making classic films does not make movies more accessible to today's audiences, it further clouds the vision of the more ignorant moviegoers today who refuse to watch old films because they are black and white. Re-makes such as this one breed ignorance. We are now plagued with a generation of morons who now more than ever refuse to watch the original because the new one MUST be better, it's in color! I don't care who refuses to watch what movies and for what reason, I'm just trying to make a point that re-making old movies, especially EXACT re-makes, is entirely unnecessary and does more harm than good. Why do we even teach history in schools? Why don't we just "update" all the things that have happened in the past, so that they will be "more accessible to today's audiences?" I bet a year 2000 version of the bombing of Pearl Harbor or of the Nazi death camps would be a lot more interesting than these boring, grainy, black and white documentaries that we have to deal with today! Stupidity. History is there to be learned from, not "updated."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second viewing of film... second review (WITH SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat through the film again a few days after first seeing it.I didn't really change my opinion of the film; I still thought practically all the performances were dreadful (and why did all the actors insist upon using those Southern Fried accents?) In fact, seeing the film again merely highlighted how awful the acting was, though particularly bad were of course Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates (that ridiculous giggle!) and Anne Heche who really annoyed me as Marion Crane. Rita Wilson who had only a small role as Marion's co-worker even managed to badly botch what was really quite an easy role.The least ludicrous acting was that of William H. Macy who played Arbogast adequately. Second least embarrassing acting was that of Julianne Moore who played Lila. She completely fails to convince us that she's a concerned sister, but at least she can get through most of her scenes without making the audience cringe. Instead of the concerned sister, Lila here more accurately resembles a rather irritable woman who has awoken one Monday morning to find she's run out of coffee.But really the whole film's success rides on the characterisation of Marion Crane and Norman Bates. This fails badly and so the film does too.When Marion is questioned by the highway patrolman, her demeanour suggests more than anything a flippant and mildly irritated schoolgirl who has just been caught chewing gum in class, or has been scolded for chatting. At no point is there any suspense as the viewer really couldn't care whether she gets caught or not.Actually, Anne Heche can't even communicate the action of driving a car convincingly.Once she meets creepy Norman with his incessant giggle Marion is obviously freaked out by his weird behaviour and can't get out of there fast enough. This is a major failing for many reasons, not the least of which is that it pretty much gives away the film's ending. And if Norman is so freaky, and Marion is so clearly freaked out by his behaviour, why did she stick around? In any event the scenes with Norman and Marion as played in the original were warm and friendly, and in the end Norman has unwittingly convinced Marion to return the money. Though the dialogue in the remake is the same, we don't get the impression that Marion has come to this decision from talking to Norman. Their scenes together in the remake are awkward and uncomfortable and suggest two people who don't like one another politely making small talk through gritted teeth. Marion and Norman in this film have ZERO rapport.Vince Vaughn's attempt at Norman Bates was a complete misfire too. Particularly grating moments are where he talks about people who stuff dogs and cats, and then gives an absolutely ridiculous and idiotic expression indicating disgust. When Arbogast asks if Marion returned to the motel after staying the night Norman responds "No. Why would she? Heheheheh he hehe he he he he!"Also pretty bad was his horrified cry of "Blood! Blood...! blood blood BLOOD blood Blood BLOOOOD bloood blood BLOOD!" Hmmmmm, effective.But the dumbest bit, I think, is the scene where Sheriff Chambers explains to Sam that "Mrs Bates poisoned this guy when she found out that he was married" and Sam happily nods and says "Aaaah!" like all had been explained and he's now seen the light and can happily go off home now. And notice how at no point in the entire film does Sam ever seem sad or upset at Marion's disappearance? Seems more focused on groping Lila at every turn.Now, onto what I liked.The opening shot over Phoenix slowing zooming in on the hotel was very effective.I did think the shower scene was very well handled and quite horrifying. (Though the characterisation of Marion was so badly botched I didn't feel sad when she died, though I did feel sorry for Marion in the original) In any event the murder sequence itself was well-done. I liked the more-elaborate spiralling zoom-out from Marion's staring eye, and I did actually think the insertion of the frame showing storm clouds was effective.I also thought the death of Arbogast was well done and again the shots of a naked woman in blindfold and a farm animal on the road worked well in my opinion.Finally I thought the climactic scene in the fruit cellar was very good. Lila's more aggressive behaviour here was great.Basically the bits where the new film diverges from the original I enjoyed. I enjoyed seeing what changes could be made to the way the film is presented, and I think the film would have been far more effective if the new director had re-conceived the film from a fresh directorial angle while using the same script. Now THAT would have been an interesting film.One controversial addition to the new version is the unmistakable depiction of Norman masturbating while watching Marion through the peep-hole. Though I'm not necessarily convinced that the scene was made more effective by the insertion of those sound effects, it was an addition the new director was perfectly free to make. Certainly no one can say with any authority that Norman WOULDN'T have done that because it is only a fictional story; we don't know what he would or wouldn't do. Also, if, as claimed, Norman would not have masturbated because he was repressed and was constantly being "watched" by mother, then why did he peep at Marion at all? Clearly it was a lustful Norman who did the peeping totally free of Mother's control, and Mother only took over afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably seemed like a good idea at the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As, of course, a big fan of the original I avidly viewed this one out of curiosity when it appeared on cable.The many faults with such a project have been widely discussed here, but I think the thing that really ruined this movie was the simple fact that the acting here was terrible. The actors simply fail in their job of bring the characters to life. Unlike the original there is no chemistry or sensuality in the opening scene with the lovers; they just do not seem like a couple. Then as Marion's afternoon gets underway, at no point does Heche, unlike Janet Leigh, manage to breathe any life into her character at all. Leigh's Marion was a troubled soul and we felt for her. Heche is merely going though the motions, and her bird-like frame and cutsey-pie mannerisms destroy the smouldering sexuality that the character requires.In the original even simple scenes such as Marion being stopped by the patrolman were full of suspense. Here they fall flat due to Heche's unsatisfactory performance. Meanwhile even small roles, such as the car salesman, that were so well acted in the original, are here badly blundered.Importantly, here the viewer feels no attachment for the characters. In the original the viewer was made to like Marion, to like Sam Loomis, to like Milton Arbogast, and to like Norman Bates. For the film to work the viewer must care for and have sympathy for these characters. As acted in this film Marion is a cute and perky girl who gleefully steals money on a whim and suddenly giggles to herself when imagining the oil-man's reaction to his missing money, Sam Loomis is a dim country bumpkin, Arbogast here lacks the warmth and humanity that Martin Balsam brought to the role, and Norman here lacks the boyish and naive charm of Anthony Perkins' original portrayal. Didn't they realise that for the film to work Norman, while remaining slightly off-beat, must ultimately appear rather endearing and someone who could turn on the sly charm when required (like in his scene with Arbogast)? He is not meant to appear to be TOO weird so as to preserve the shock of the ending. (Duh!) This film paints him as a creepy weirdo that would send prospective motel guests screeching away in horror before even signing the register.I'm sure the reason they removed the "Sam, I know you're not the 'seeing illusions'-type" scene with the Sheriff and Mrs. Chambers in the churchyard was because the Sam Loomis as portrayed here does in fact look like a slow pumpkin head who has taken too many swigs of the old moonshine.Perhaps the best acting came from Julianne Moore as Lila Crane, but even here we don't believe in the character as we did in the original.Ummmmmmm. Why do people claim you can't see the original in a cinema these days? I've seen it in a theatre and while clearly the mundane Australian city in which I live is culturally superior to that little backwater known as the United States, surely someone there can manage to run the original in a cinema somewhere?AND THEY EVEN CHANGED THE HOUSE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the points that Mr McClure on the first page puts down. But, the result of Gus Van Sant's 1998, shot-to-shot remake of Hitchcock's masterpiece, is a bad one. Not everyone will hate this film but others are bound to detest it. If anything, it only seems to stregthen the original when you watch it. Wouldn't have been a better (and definetly more successful) idea to have adapted as a play maybe instead of making it a time-wasting, money-wasting, generally panned flop? It doesn't do any good for the actors. Vince Vaughn (Norman Bates) and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) are talented and are not to be looked down upon after this film is watched. Their peformances as two of the most notable characters in cinema history aren't terrible but the original peformances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh were extraordinary and ultimately unmatchable. The added bits are totally uneccessary and would send Hitchcock rolling in his grave. This of course the masturbation moment and the shower scene, which is bound to be the centrepiece of this remake. Naturally, it's made more extreme but it's nothing compared to the ground-breaking, sequence on celluoid from 1960. Actually, it's terrible.There's loads of blunders, too many. But why do this? Was it for the teens? Most likely but i'm sure they were other reasons. This makes Psycho III and IV look like masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting as anti-art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first it seemed to me that this movie completely missed the point -- that the director had no idea why we have these things called "theaters" where people pay to sit and watch light on a screen. The idea of duplicating this film exactly, with new actors and with color film, is made more pointless when the spontaneity Hitchcock was given on "Psycho" was the very reason it became his best movie.And then I was reading a "Jim's Journal" compendium. The author of that comic strip, Scott Dikkers, tried to make a comic strip that seemed to totally miss the point of comic strips. There were no punch lines, no jokes, just factual observations. ("My cat jumped on my lap and fell asleep.") Dikkers was subverting the comic strip medium, stripping away the conventions to re-make the form. Andy Kaufmann did this, Johnny Rotten did this, the Dadaists did this. Their work was alternately seen as subversive and total crap.So, say you wanted to make an anti-art film, something Dadaist that ignored all common sense of movie-making. You couldn't just make a plotless film, or an absurd film, or just show static; everyone would label that as an artistic effort. But remaking a movie that doesn't need remaking, in a way that takes away much of the power of the original without adding anything whatsoever, this is a new subversion in directing. Like it or not, this remake of "Psycho" strikes out totally new territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A courageous, interesting failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this film is hated. How dare they have the gall to remake of the most beloved films in the history of American Cinema? What were they thinking?And, of course no one can match the performance of Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn doesn't. Even Tom Hanks couldn't. No one can. It's unperformable. But, if you view the film as it's own, it's not that bad.Few changes have been made from the orginal. Most them subtle. One change, however, underlines the film to a crashing hault. The masturbation scene. And, if you ever wanted to see Vince Vaugh masturbate to Anne Heche showering, this is the film for you. However, a serious film buff, will see that this change gets a laugh, at precisely the moment when one is not needed.Anyways, you got to admire Van Sant for even trying this. The film is watchable. I love watching Vince Vaughn, even if his performance pales in comparison to Anthony Perkins. Anne Heche is adequate in the role of Marion Crane. Viggo Mortensen plays it all wrong as her lover. William H. Macy does a stellar job as Det. Arbogast. Robert Forster is good as the physican at the end. Even if you hate the film, it's got an all star cast, and I'm sure the actors had fun making the film.I figured the film would at least break even at the box office, due to interest alone. It's not great, of course, it's not the 1960 version, but it's not all that bad. Watch it for Macy and Forster. Imagine the fun Vince Vaughn had chewing into this role. I would have loved the film to be shot in complete Black and White. But, this film fails. It's watchable, but so is Death Wish 3, that doesn't make it great however. But, film buffs should view the film out of curiousity. And I applaud Van Sant to have the courage to tread into these waters. Most directors wouldn't. I'd have loved to see the Coen's direct this. But, overall, this film is like the masturbation scene. An attempt to creature past passion and greatness</fullReview>

Gus Van Sant is a good director , but of course not as good as THE MASTER OF SUSPENCE. The actors are good , the writer is the same, so if you like Psycho from 1960 , you must see this one , to see the diference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B&amp;W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly. If you must, watch it as a curiosity, but I would suggest that you not bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+ for making Psycho. I was surprised to see almost shot-for-shot takes. What did this film in, and it's where it counts the most, is it's actors. With one small exception, they didn't quite match-up to the original. Give em an A+ for the effort "and I really do believe they tried", but they came up short where the original has this one beat, and that's with the amount of suspense that the original has over this one. I wonder, what would've happened if there wasn't an original one to go and base our opinions on? Hmmmmm. In any case, seeing since there's an original one that Hitchcock made, there is always going to be the "who did what better" comments. Like I said before. This one comes very close, but misses it. If only the Master of Suspense were still alive to help.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of years ago there was a so called "monster weekend" on the BBC and one of the films they showed, was the '76 remake of "King Kong". Right after, the host asked a couple of moviefans what they thought of it and, sticking to the rules of The Serious Film Fan, there were predictable reactions like "Junk', "A mess", and, of course, "We liked the original better". I think that King Kong '76 is a flawed, but exciting and moving film and I also believe that a lot of classics are perfect material to be done again. As an example, the great Alfred Hitchcock made a remake of his own "The Man Who Knew Too Much". On the other hand, only considering doing a remake of Stanley Kubrick movies like "a Clockwork Orange" or "2001" would already be insane. But Kubrick movies like "the Shining" and "Lolita" ARE introvert enough to be done again, and both movies were recently remade. Hitchcock's "Psycho" falls somewhere in the middle. The film is introvert enough, but the fact remains that this film is one of the most popular films of one of the most popular directors of all time. So when a guy like Gus Van Sant announces a remake, he shouldn't be surprised when people are indignant or even angry, especially when he announces to remake it almost shot-by-shot. Aside from the 'suitable for remake' discussion, a filmmaker has to ask himself the question 'WHY am I doing it again?'. Van Sant had an interesting answer to this question, he said that he thinks it's a shame that so many older good films are forgotten. It's interesting because who never had this con- versation (as a kid): "What's on Tv tonight?" "Here's something, a thriller about a bankrobber on the run...o wait, never mind, it's a '56 film". Why are people 'discriminating' older films. what's the reason? So it's quite an interesting experiment to remake an old film shot by shot, this time in colour and, of course, with a new cast, and set in this day and age. You keep the fact that it's actually and older film secret and reveal it when the film is over: "Y'all liked the film? Well, it's a shot-by-shot remake of a film from '56". (The experiment could also be in a vice versa version: remem- ber the anthology "Lumiere et Compagny"?). But such a reaction is impossible with a Psycho-remake: first of all, Hitchcock's Psycho is the archetype modern horrorfilm and its leading character, Norman Bates, the archetype wolf in sheep's clothing. Besides that, the film had four (count 'em: FOUR!) sequels (in color; taking place in this day and age) so you had to be on an other planet the last thirty years or so to not know what the 'punchline' of Psycho is (that is, Bates 'being' his mother). If Van Sant's reason for remaking a masterpiece would have been bona fide, he would have taken a less known classic. Now, his main reason for doing a Psycho-remake seems to be wanting to be in Hitchcock's shoes (let alone the financial success of the recent overdone 'stalk 'n slash teenfilm' revival).This movie proves one thing, though: if you remake a masterpiece shot-by-shot, it doesn't guarantee that you have a new masterpiece in your hands.</fullReview>

Vince Vaughn does a fine job as Norman Bates but the rest of the casting wrecked the movie. Maybe it's because we're comparing them to the performances of Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, Vera Miles etc. The Musical score is updated and is outstanding.

Okay, okay. So it was pointless, but making a shot-by-shot remake of a classic was a good idea. It gives the younger generation (like me) a change to see it on the big screen. Julianne Moore was perfect as Lila Crane, so was Anne Heche as Marion. Vince Vaughn is creepy enough to be Norman Bates. William H. Macy plays detectives well. Instead of "dissing" this movie, let's praise it. It's not original (duh) but it's still a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very anxious to see the remake of PSYCHO but I didn't rush enough to see it on the theatre. When finally It finally came out on video I rented it. My anxiety dissapeared precisely the moment on which the credits begun. This film is A COLORED PHOTOCOPY OF THE ORIGINAL. The dialogues and the musical score are exactly the same (with little exceptions: in the original Marion steals 40,000$ and in this one 400,000, and some microscopic sentences have been added to the script to put a difference because of the years: 1960-1998). I finally finished watching it. The ironic thing was that I knew every dialogue in the film before it was said, so it was a little boring. Some peculiarities:The knife used on this film in the shower scene and all the killings belongs to director John Woo (who directed films such as FACE/OFF), thanks of the original film Janet Leigh (who plays "Marion Crane") was nominated for best actress in the ACADEMY AWARDS and Alfred Hitchcock for BEST DIRECTOR. Anne Heche, who plays Leigh's role in the new one won a RAZZIE award for WORST ACTRESS and (unbeleivably) Gus Van Sant as WORST DIRECTOR. Avoid this one if you haven't seen it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Public Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this one immune to both serious praise and harsh criticism because, like Joseph Losey's 1951 remake of "M", it's really more of an academic exercise than an attempt at cinema. Since Van Sant was wise enough to avoid any vain attempts to improve on the original, he ought not to have included even his occasional embellishments, such as Norman actually masturbating at the peep hole, the bloodied up murders and that silly bird menagerie down the cellar. If he'd held out for a slightly bigger budget, it could've been shot in black and white as a 1959 period piece. God knows the 40 year old dialogue doesn't remotely resemble present day speech patterns and the characters all belong to another era. One casting coup he either overlooked or couldn't pull off was coaxing the delightful Patricia Hitchcock out of retirement. Wouldn't she have been just perfect in the old Lureen Tuttle role as the sheriff's wife?Still, I have to commend Van Sant for leaving most of his creative impulses at the door as he performed what amounted to a public service. This carbon copy, however under and over exposed along its frayed edges, is an excellent deterrent to some other clueless upstart who would've surely come along eventually and pulled a KING KONG or THE HAUNTING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get this straight, this movie was not made for the die hard fans of the original film... it was done as an excercise to see if they could get some of the millions of people who have not seen the original because they don't like 'old films' (which is a group I have to admit I belonged to) to get a taste for the classics. If it wasn't for the remake I probably would never have watched the original.One of the main problems with the remake, apart from the slow pace when compared to modern films, was the poor choice of Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates.Please understand that this is not an attack on Vince Vaughn as an actor, but he is just too big and imposing a figure to appear harmless.If you compare the scene in the back of the office where Norman and Marion have their meal you will see what I mean. When Anthony Perkins played that scene he appeared as a harmless little man complaining about how bad his life is.... uncomfortable but not life threatening. Vaughn seems like he's going to launch himself across the room at Marion at any second. After a few minutes in the same room with this fizzing, hissing loon I would be getting in my car, not the shower!Once again no offence to Vince Vaughn, but Norman is a killer in the form of a nobody... not a hard body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total vanity project!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this movie because I had some coupons for free videos and decided to finally see how bad it was.I've read some of the reviews here and everyone pretty much agrees that it is a ludicrous, pointless failure. So I will limit my comments mostly to observations I didn't see in the other reviews.It's full of careless touches. For instance, during the murder of Marion, the knife is totally clean and shiny each time it comes up after stabbing her. It never gets any blood on it. No one carries parasols on sunny days except elderly Chinese women, and haven't any time from the fifties up to the present.Choosing this talentless actor to play Norman Bates didn't have to be a total loss. Many killers have that bland kind of baby face. However, he did not carry it off. In fact, no one really could carry it off because of the way it was filmed, supposedly shot for shot like the original. Unfortunately that forces you to compare them.If the movie had been shot from a different angle, say the same story but retold in a new way, it could have been fun. But slavishly following the scenes and camera angles while throwing in the occasional thing that wasn't in the original is just jarring.In the original, Lila finds a mysterious book in Norman's boyhood bedroom which has no name on the spine. It is clear from her reaction it is horrendous pornography. But in the remake it's been changed to a skin mag, in case the unmarked book was too subtle for today's "stupid" audience. I just want to say, if people are stupider it is because no one allows them to think and figure things out anymore. Everything is now laid out in graphic detail. William H. Macy, in choosing to wear a parody of a 50s fedora, immediately turns the movie into a cartoon. He overplays the detective in such a campy way that it doesn't fit in with the attempts by the others to play it straight. This is purely a vanity project by the director and should not have been released at all - it is without merit. Watching it reminded me of the time I saw a stage play of Send Me No Flowers, and afterward saw the movie with Rock Hudson and Doris Day. There was no comparison, the movie had eliminated half the humor of the stage play by casting actors who read their lines too broadly, and by changing the dialogue. This remake of Psycho could have been better with a more relaxed attitude about following the exact blocking of the scenes. This just makes you feel tense to see where they do and do not depart from the original. And if the Anne Heche and Julianne Moore roles had been reversed it would have been superior. No one cares if Anne Heche's Marion is killed; she has failed to make her character likeable as Janet Leigh did, whereas if Julianne Moore were killed off in the beginning it would be more upsetting.Last but not least, I have to say that Tony Perkins made the original Psycho what it was. Even though others have pointed it out, I must reiterate that this is the major, major problem with any remake. He was so effective in it that it typecast him as a psycho for the rest of his life. New audiences would not realize that Tony Perkins was previously cast in normal, romantic movies. When his flair for the nervous twitch was discovered it was all over for any other kind of role.Whereas this bland actor who tried to portray a psychopathic killer can go on tomorrow and play any kind of role under the sun.This was not the way to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, but everyone knows this by now.Hopefully people will lay off this remake idea nowIn closing I want to point out that Hitchcock remade his own Man Who Knew Too Much and IMPROVED it. Now, if this Psycho was truly Hitchcockian it would have been greater than the original. That did not happen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They only allowed Van Sant to remake Psycho , because of the cash he brought in with Good Will Hunting. Otherwise, a Hollywood film of this sort is inconcievable. Never attempted before and probably never in the future, this is the strange case of a strictly musical notion of a "cover" (or is is a "remix"), applied to cinema. Van Sant's "Psycho" is an absurd affair: it would make sense as a theatre production, but then it wouldn't be "shot-for-shot"... It's difficult to make sense of the director's motives - why retaylor the movie for the 90's, when many of its pretexts are anachronistic by default, most importantly, its PACE? Modern youth, unfamilliar with Hitchock, would most likely be yawning after the first 20 minutes of "Psycho"-babble and anxiously await for Bates to begin the slashing. Reamking a masterpiece usually means completely taking it out of context. Not to mention that Vaughn is awfully miscast. And what in the hell should we make of the little "Van-Sant-isms", that are inserted into the murder scenes, when they should belong back in "My Own Private Idaho" ? They are so out of place that even the intelligent viewers would shrug their shoulders in total befuddlement. Sure, all this madness is entertaining to watch, especially for those who have seen the original, but in the end it's pointless and undeserving an evaluation in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a terrible movie, but there's really no point to this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black &amp; white, while they conveniently forget that both "Clerks" and "Schindler's List" were filmed in black &amp; white and are great movies.Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black &amp; white are the same people who wouldn't like "Psycho" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes. And the murders are not the grisly blood/guts/gore/bone-snapping that people are used to from having seen "Halloween," "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street." This is why remaking "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work, because it's really only of interest to people who are fans of the original. Everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next "Scream" sequel comes out, and for that reason, they will be disappointed. "Psycho" relies on suspense and mystery, not blood and guts. (And just so nobody thinks that I must be a senior citizen if I like older movies, let me set the record straight by saying that I am 21.)So if doing the movie in color was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just colorize the movie and rerelease it? I mean, what's the point of remaking a movie if you're not going to change *anything*? The least he could have done was to put his own director's spin on it, rather than just copying Hitchcock's - or even better, hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original "Psycho" book. But it seems that Van Sant couldn't decide whether he wanted to remake "Psycho" *exactly* or not. This should have been an all or nothing project - either remake the movie exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches thrown in that don't seem to have any purpose. Such as having Norman masturbate while he spies on Marion undressing. It doesn't serve the plot at all, and the only reason he put it in was because he *could*. He wanted to say, "Hitch couldn't show people masturbating in 1960 so I'm going to do it." Whoopee, big deal, like I'm so shocked at seeing someone masturbate. And what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes? And then he leaves *out* an important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the Sheriff outside the church.Plus, by using the almost exact same script, the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism. The opening credits say that the year is 1998. Then what's with Marion's 60-ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her? Why do Marion and Sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room, when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing? Why are there no air conditioners in Marion's office? Why does the Bates Motel have no tv's in the rooms, and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why does the Sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the Bates motel? This was why using the exact same script was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it. It needed a whole reworking.While Vince Vaughn turned in a good performance as Norman, he just didn't seem right for the part. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so creepy was that Norman had that innocent, boy-next-door quality, so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the part, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer?That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original "Psycho" movie, and wanted this to be a tribute. This isn't a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be some people's only exposure to "Psycho." I really think you should see this movie only if you've seen the original. Since I am a fan of anything to do with "Psycho," I bought a used copy of the remake, which I may watch occasionally. The original movie was a filet mignon, whereas the remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday, so it's nice to have a hamburger once in a while, for a change.</fullReview>

Why do Hollywood insist on re-making classic movies? Why cant they just leave the classics alone? I`m sure there are people out there that enjoyed this drab version, but it is probably people not old enough to remember the original. And that is sad. I`m just waiting for some Hollywood movie maker to announce they are re-making Casablanca or Gone with the Wind. Or worse still, Citizen Kane. Please Hollywood. Leave the old ones Alone.

		<fullReview>The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors such as Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in the role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a creditable job, but one keeps mentally comparing her to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson merely walks through his role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as the private detective.Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can't build the suspense the way Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in, whereas in this version, it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting. And I think the black &amp; white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version.Maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when.All I can say is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PSYCHO is a good remake of the 1960 original. The reason people don't like it so much is because they compare it to the original. If the original had not been made, then there would not have been so much criticism of this one. Don't get me wrong, I do think the original is better than this, but not much better. Also, I would like to see a remake of Psycho II with the actors from this version. I give PSYCHO a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was soooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disapointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it did suck. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too dense or something.

		<shortDescription>This remake blows goats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have seen the original PSYCHO, so don't think I'm bashing the original movie. I loved it, with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and superb direction by Alfred Hitchcock. I even have the Movie Maniacs' Norman Bates action figure. But, Gus VanSant's remake falls short of Hitchcock's definative movie. For one thing, I'm glad he didn't change the script, nothing else could work. But, I hate the casting. You could read Perkins' face and see the struggle between Norman's split personalities. Also, PSYCHO does not work in color. A moody film like PSYCHO needs black and white to effectively work. The only part I liked was the way VanSant did the killing sequences, when he spliced in cuts to a cloudy sky in the shower sequence, and Arbogast's murder was handled exceptionally well. However, these well-done sequences do not make up for a poorly done film. I pray that no one else trys to "improve" on a Hitchcock classic. Except maybe "The Birds." That movie could use a remake IMHO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the suspense?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok. The orginal Psycho scared the heck out of me. And it still does. It is, in my opinion, the best Hitchcock film ever made. But the remake? Not a bad try...but not that good either.To begin with, whoever said that Vince Vaughn is better than Anthony Perkins is crazy in the head. Vaughn, a good actor otherwise, portrayed Norman Bates as a scared little boy. You can see it in his sheepish grin at the end. But Anthony Perkins portrayed scared little boy AND grown man defining his clingy mother, as well as "mother" herself. In the original Psycho you can just tell it in his face what personality is within at that moment. From what I have seen, plenty of people ridiculed the new vs. the old. But that's to be expected; this is a remake, for crying out loud! The music is the same, so is the dialog. It doesn't make any sense to change some. It's either all or nothing.But to stray from the usual comments, the acting was good. Aside from Vaugh's "little boy" act, Anne carried the character of Marion Crane to new heights. Julianne More, however, was cast poorly as Lila.Last but not least, the suspense was lacking. At least do Alfred Hitchcock some good by keeping you on the edge of your seat. And what's this with not using the original, I mean ORIGINAL, Bates house? A newly-built set in front of the old one on the Universal lot just doesn't cut it for die-hard Psycho fans. Plus some of the speeches like the one "mother" speaks at the end were too fast. It doesn't give you time to understand what's really wrong with Norman.Forgive me for completely dissing the final project, but it could have been perfected in so many ways. The only thing that really excited me is that the original license numbers on Marion's car were carried over to her car on the remake. Did you see the NFB?</fullReview>

This just seems like a colorized version of Psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Norman,and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folks,do yourself some justice. Don't bother with this.

		<fullReview>I can't see any reason to remake this movie, except perhaps to fulfill a sense of curiosity. Other than that, it just strikes me as pointless. Someone mentioned that there are folks who haven't seen the original and aren't likely to. Hello? Am I missing something or are there not still establishments that rent videos out there?I disagree that any of the actors in the remake were better or more vibrant, or whatever than their counterparts in the original. All the originals were effective or superb in their roles. Vince Vaughn didn't work for reasons already mentioned, but I'll mention them again, just to emphasize the point (as if it mattered): Vaughn looks like a nutcase from the get-go (even to people who haven't seen his giggling madman in Clay Pigeons). Can't hold a candle to Anthony Perkins' subtly creepy (and perfect performance). Viewers of the original should stay away from the remake as they're likely to be bored out of there skulls. Even watching it to satisfy curiosity just doesn't seem worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.Where does this film go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is all wrong. For one thing, he looks far too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does screams I DID IT! The original movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on Norman, and turns her into a real separate character. How about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than Danny Elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. This shower scene merely serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some nice color blood. Which brings us to the choice to film in color. Didn't work.There is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'll preface this by saying that I am a very big fan of the original Psycho. It is definitely one of the most ingenious and shocking films ever made. As for the "remake", I don't understand what point Gus Van Sant was trying to make. Was he making a shot-for-shot homage to Hitchcock's original brilliance, or was he trying to bring the film to new heights? Either way, he failed miserably. (Please note, if you have yet to see Psycho, do not read on, this message contains some spoilers)When this movie was released, all I heard was that it was exactly the same as the original, probably to justify what he was doing. But this isn't a carbon copy. Far from it. If it were identical, how could the movie feel completely different, as it does from the original? It may be shot-for-shot the same in terms of camera angles and editing cuts(although even that is different because Van Sant splices weird subliminal shots during the two stabbing scenes, not to mention a small scene which was completely deleted), but that's only half the movie. The other half is the acting, which, unlike camera shots, gives the characters reason and motivation. The acting in this new film is very different, and therefore, the characters come off strangely, Anne Heche's Marion is more aggressive than Janet Leigh, Vince Vaughn comes off crazy from the first word he says, while Anthony Perkins' portrayal is very down-to-earth.My main gripe with this film is the way Van Sant treated it while shooting, justifying his "remake" by claiming it was some sort of homage to Hitch, but what he really did was take Hitch's original idea, and tweak it to fit his own ideas. Perhaps he wanted certain lines delivered with more aggression or less emphasis on certain words the way they are in Hitch's film, but it's no reason to do a half-assed remake. If Van Sant wanted the movie to be to his liking, then he should have stripped the original down and done a complete overhaul. Unfortunately, I don't feel Van Sant had the guts to tell the Hitchcock faithful that he was making Psycho the way he wants it, after all, he's only Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting wasn't THAT good(but that's for another review). Instead, he shields himself behind Hitch's genius and throws just enough into the mix to make it his own. The movie Van Sant made was not Psycho, it was psychotic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire shock of the original Psycho (1960) was that sweet, innocent, somewhat effeminate Anthony Perkins -- the Leonardo DiCaprio of the 1950's -- was capable of even being violent. Vince Vaughn has none of the vulnerability, let alone physical structure, to carry this out. Why was he even considered for the role, especially after idiotic performances in movies such as Clay Pigeons (1998)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the an insult to the original, but not about to replace it either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface my comments by stating that I am in my mid twenties and I have seen the original 'Psycho' several times. I will be as non specific as possible but if you have no clue what Psycho is about you may not want to read further. If you have never seen either 'Psycho', go to the source and rent Hitchcock's version. That said, Gus Van Zant's 'Psycho' is an interesting homage. Interesting mostly in that, it's almost an exact replica of the original. The 'New' Psycho is not a remake as much as it is a color copy. This is not a full scale revamping. This is not Romeo and Juliet transported to current day Los Angeles. No new angles are given to the story, no key additions to the legend just the same film with new actors, financial figures adjusted, dates changed, and color images projected to bring it into current times.So how can it be any better or worse than the original?I've seen the film the Music Man; I also saw my high school drama club perform the play. It was quite different. Same story, same lines, same songs. Not the same actors. Not as good. Well the big difference between the two Psycho films is in the acting. Even though they are reciting the exact same lines as their predecessors, some of the actors are able to project a different feel, which is both a blessing and a curse. Julianne Moore's Lila Crane is much more vibrant and real woman than Vera Miles' original rendering. William H. Macy's Arbogast seems more reserved and unsure of the case and himself than Martin Balsam's rendition of the character was. While Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis does not really seem to be all that concerned about anything compared to the John Gavin portrayal in the original.. The major flaw of the film, however, is the portrayal of Norman Bates. Not to say that Vince Vaughn does a poor job, but the slant he gives the character detracts from one of the key elements to the original's success as a thriller. Somehow his turn as Norman projects a dangerous almost un-nerving quality from the moment you meet him that makes the way the story progresses and concludes seem much more formulatic. The key to the original version was that Anthony Perkin's Norman Bates , through not only his words but his mannerisms, projected a boyish innocence and painful shyness that perfectly masked the true nature of the events and made it believable that he was the appalled by his ailing mother's behavior but ultimately willing to be her protector. It seemed to me at the end of the early version, you needed to listen to what the psychiatrist had to say to accept the grisly truth of Marion Crane's fate and of Norman Bates' true demeanor. In the new version, the fact that Norman seems creepy from the second you meet him undermines the impact of the ending. Many people claim that today's generation has not seen the original 'Psycho' and probably never will. I hope that this is not the case. Gus Van Zant's version is not an insult to the original classic, but it's not about to replace it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile filmmaking experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched both "Psycho" (1960) and "Psycho" (1960), I have to agree with most of the comments that the original was better. But, I think most of the negative "what the hell were they thinking?" comments miss a major point of the remake: "Psycho" (1998) exists to celebrate the original. Just on the surface, its release has brought attention to the original for a whole new generation. For that alone it should be complimented.Besides that, the remake is a celebration of filmmaking. For the most part, we just go to the theater in an attempt to be entertained. The technical side of film isn't important, nor should it be, for it would interfere with the illusion of seeing a film. However, "Psycho" (1998) welcomes us to do just that: look at the filmmaking and see how a good film is made.In all, it adds up to a nice experiment: we are watching a new film that we've seen before. In this way, we, as viewers, become an important part of the film itself. Gus Van Sant knows that we're going to notice the differences; in fact, he knows we'll be waiting to see them. He also knows we'll be waiting to see how Vince Vaughn will deliver a familiar line of dialogue. This is why this remake is ingenious.Before "Psycho" (1960) because a cultural phenomenon that everyone knew about without having to have seen it, it was viewed as a tense movie where the viewer didn't know what was coming next. "Psycho" (1998) is also tense, but in a difference sense, because we are now all-too familiar with the film's plot: we know what's coming next and the anticipation of seeing it again for the first time is exhilarating.I don't think there should be more shot-for-shot remakes of films done; "Psycho" (1998) will suffice. Love it or hate it, as a film it makes you think about both filmmaking as an art and one's role as a viewer. When was the last time you left the theater with those types of thoughts in your head?</fullReview>

I should have knewed that it was just a commercial trap: ''In case of any people would get bored, lets add some flirting to heat up the fever!''. It made me sick!Of course this movie was boring, because you knew every line and just about exactly what was going to happen. Though it is an ok film i guess.

		<fullReview>I'll admit I was prejudiced before I saw this movie, but that was okay; I had gone through the same experience when 2010 came out. I took the tack that there was simply no way 2010 was going to be anywhere near the same experience as 2001, one of the great movies of all time. That realized, I was able to enjoy it for what it was. And it was pretty good, in and of itself!So now to Psycho (1998). I agree with most that Psycho (1960) is also one of the great movies of all time. So when I heard of the remake, I steeled myself to at least be curious to watch it.Again, it was never going to compete with the original; but, I thought, maybe there will be some originality to it. And I wanted to see the new ideas the filmmakers came up with.Problem is, there are no new ideas, outside of a few artsy-pictures of things like clouds moving in front of the moon. I didn't know it when I went into the theatre, but this is an EXACT shot-by-shot remake. All the camera angles, all of the dialogue, EVERYTHING is a copy of the original. They even lifted the recording of Bernard Herrmann's music from the original soundtrack and pasted it onto this one. Outside of a few small changes in lines, and some silly updating (Julianne Moore, as Lila, carries around a Walkman), there was nothing original, no creativity, nothing new.So. Where does that leave me? It leaves me asking, Why? Why do this? Why do a remake of a movie classic that you know everybody is going to question up front, and then do AN EXACT copy of that classic (including stealing the original soundtrack)? I don't think such a thing has ever been done before in movie history.Before I end up casting the entire cast and crew into the River Styx, it did occur to me that one positive reason was so the modern viewing public, who has never seen Psycho before in a theatre, could now have that chance.But I still don't know if that justifies it--I found the movie lifeless and boring. William H. Macy doesn't seem to know where Arbogast is coming from. Some people say Vaughan did a better job than Anthony Perkins; Vaughan can't hold Perkins' taxidermy needle. In addition to being a convincing all-around-nice-guy-slash-madman, Perkins put so much subtlety into his role. One bit of humor Vaughan missed was the scene in which Norman walks up the stairs, and we see him from behind. Perkins sways his hips from side to side, as would a woman; Vaughan plays it straight. And in the scene where Norman is watching Marion disrobe, all we saw in the original was Perkins' eyeball in an extreme closeup; it's up to us to imagine what he is thinking. We have to do no such work in the remake; we're greeted to the obvious sounds of male masturbation as Vaughan satisfies himself. What was that I said about subtlety?I think the main problem is that Psycho was made originally in B&amp;W; you just can't go and recreate a B&amp;W movie in color with the same shots and angles. Shooting a B&amp;W movie is far removed from shooting a color movie. Those who don't like the original because it is in B&amp;W have a lot of courses in Art Appreciation to make up.So, somebody owing somebody else a favor must have been the genesis of this flick. Or maybe it just seemed like a good idea, an interesting concept, and let's see what happens. Turned out to be a so-so curiosity, and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people will stay loyal to the original, saying how this one is unadventurous and too colourful. But I don't. See, what annoys me, is the principal/rule that some movie goers have, which defies them from admitting to enjoying a remake, however brilliant it is. The remake of Psycho, is in no way brilliant. In fact, in parts, it is very disappointing-Anne Heche and Viggo Mortenson for example, are not as good as they were in previous films. But, the original, also had faults. Casting Anthony Perkins was a big mistake, and despite however many people say how good he was, I think he was terrible. Vince Vaughn is incredibly scary. His nervous laugh as he watches Marion Crane eat the sandwiches he prepared for her, the well executed line "She just goes a little mad sometimes, we all goe a little mad some times". His dark stare and smile at the end of the film as he sits looking in the direction of the camera. William H Macy is also an improvement on the original despite the awful hat he wears during his screen time.The casting directors didn't really have a hard time watching loads of films to cast the right people-Julianne Moore starred in Boogie Nights with William H Macy. She also starred in The Lost World Jurassic Park with Vince Vaughn, and he starred in the recent hit, Return To Paradise with Anne Heche.In summary, the new version is slightly better made-it should be after all this time after the original, but I couldn't help thinking that a remake should be ten times better than the first because of the large gap between the two, and how well films have progressed over the ages. This is no indication of how far films have improved. Rating=3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should only make a remake of films which aren't instantly recognized, remaking Psycho is just asking for trouble. Even if this remake of Psycho is a good movie (which it isn't) you will never be able to recapture the sheer suspense that Hitchcock created back in 1960. Vaughan lacked the warmth (and the coldness) of Perkins and Heche was to boring to believe she could provoke passionate murder. And the settings were just all so wrong. The Bates house wasn't the least bit scary and the mother wearing that long haired wig made her look funny rather than terrifying. They say Van Sant is a huge Hitchcock fan, any Hitchcock fan in their right mind would never try and update such a classic for the nineties. Also the fact that this film is in color means it loses a lot of its chilling aspects. When I first watched the original I thought it was a shame it was in black and white but now I can't imagine it any other way. All in all a huge mistake and completely blasphemous in movie terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point of remakes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Psycho the other night and now feel the need to comment on the remake that was made last year. When I first heard that Hollywood was remaking Psycho, I was initially annoyed. Why is Hollywood pulling out old classics, dusting them off, adding new people, and putting a finished bow on the product, passing it off as a completely new film? But when the release date rolled around, I decided to give it a chance. After all, Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche would be in it, and I enjoy both of their work. I can see why filmmakers think that this tactic of remake will work. It is initially a good idea. You shoot the movie with today's stars and you open up the story to an entirely new audience. But this remake fell flat. You just can't compare it with the classic original. Vince Vaughn did not even measure up to Anthony Perkins. He seemed like he was trying too hard to imitate the original actor, where Perkins came natural and his transitions from Norman to Mother were less apparent. I did not need to hear Norman masturbating. I do not see what this added to the movie. We know and understand that Norman was attracted to Marion. We do not need to hear it! This movie is a classic, but it does not reach out to today's audience. People today are too used to constant blood and gore that a suspenseful movie does not interest them. So another remake has fallen flat on its face. What is the point of remakes? I have yet to find out. But I am beginning to think that Hollywood is running out of ideas to stoop this low with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe half as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than asking what so many others have in saying - what was Gus Van Sant thinking? One should know that he just wanted to try and emulate the man who probably influenced him to become a director in the first place. Could anyone have made a better Psycho than Hitch? Perhaps, but this effort doesn't come close and will hopefully deter anyone else from trying in the future without some kind of interesting twist.Van Sant's Psycho is very close to being a shot for shot remake of the original. I spent most part of the film trying to see what Van Sant did differently and came up with only a few recognizable differences. The inclusion of the masturbation scene was a twist on the original, but still unecessary since one can tell by looking at Bates (Vince Vaughn) that there is an obvious attraction. I did like the way the opening title sequence was done ever so similarly to the original. It adds nothing to the film, but a piece of nostalgia that is so important. The acting and casting in this film are somewhat suspect, making it seem that the whole production was rushed (which it really was since Van Sant stuck to Hitch's original six-week shoot). Anne Heche was completely miscast as Marion Crane and only started to add emotion to the role in her last real scene. Watching Heche while she is driving the car will seem to even the most naive moviegoer as quite lame. The opening scene between her and Viggo Mortensen had no chemistry at all, and staying away from the obvious answer as to why, seemed more Mortensen's fault - another miscast. Vaughn gives a good effort as Bates, but still is no Anthony Perkins. He almost tries to be too disturbed, something that Perkins did at a much more subtle level. Watching his hands shake while talking to Heche takes more away from the scene than it adds. I guess most actors would be nervous if they had to play such a complicated role as well.The only person who I felt really got their role was Julianne Moore. As Lila Crane, she really succeeds at breathing new life into the role and taking none of the Vera Miles original portrayal away. She overpowers Mortensen in all of there scenes together and does the same to William H. Macy in guess what, another miscast playing the supposedly strong-willed Arbogast. After watching Fargo, I don't think Macy will ever be able to pull off a powerful role, or at least in my mind. He will always be known as the loser to whom nothing seems to go right.If there are any positives to this film (and there are few), I thought Van Sant did a credible job at recreating the shower scene and many of Hitch's other great shots. The camera pan over the city of Phoenix was almost exactly the same as the one shot nearly thirty years earlier. Most other things that are done well are pure credit to those involved in the original, like Bernard Herrmann's score and Joseph Stefano's script from Robert Bloch's book. I may have given this film a higher grade than it deserves mainly due to the fact that it was neat to see this film made in the nineties with a heavy sixties undertone. Worth a rental if you watch the original first.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake was exactly like I expected it to be. a remake of the original. But come on, did we really need to see Norman Bates masturbating at the sight of Anne Heche? I didn't think it was that bad, but I did not like Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Every time he did that aw-shucks laugh I wanted to punch him. I am thoroughly convinced that Vaughn is the only one that showed up for the casting call. I did however like Jullianne Moore and William H. Macy. I thought they did well in their parts, replacing Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, who also did excellently in their roles. Even though Macy's character was killed after only a short time. It's okay to see, but if you haven't, go see the original. It's a lot better, and Anthony Perkins does an excellent job in a character that he is always most remembered for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good job Gus Van Sant. I liked everything about this except Anne Heche. I'll never understand why she was put into this part.I love this idea of making not a remake of a great film but a recreation. Almost scene for scene and word for word the same movie, only updated. ($400,000 instead of $40,000 and the like) Even the license plate numbers on both of Marion's cars were the same!I liked Viggo Mortenson (A Perfect Murder), William H Macy, Philip Baker Hall (he is cool, check out Hard Eight aka Sydney) Vince Vaughn had his moments. Some parts he was better than Perkins was in the original. He seemed more.. what's the word.. effeminate? But kind of like I said in my comments for the original Psycho, It was hard to believe that Vince Vaughn's Norman didn't actually commit the murder. In 1960 I take it a lot of people didn't know. If this '98 version was the only version I'm sure that would not have been the case.One other thing to watch for... Either Anne Heche has a trouble with her math or someone was playing a game with her/us. Check out her in her motel room subtracting from $400,000.Good movie, a Hitchcock fan should give it a view. I give it a 7 out of 10. Even with Anne Heche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was not as horrible as everyone said it was. Maybe if you're a big Hitchcock freak, you'd be disappointed. Completely understandable. However, for those of us who had never seen the original, this was a pretty fair intro to it. I actually just watched the original last night on Encore and, personally, found it rather boring for the 40 minutes after the death of Marion Crane. I mean, nothing really happens except Arbogast getting slashed and falling down the stairs. Otherwise, there ain't much to it. I'll be the first to admit the film is a classic but I'm not afraid to criticize it simply because it's been touted as the best horror film of all time or because it's Hitchcock. It's definitely ONE of the best horror films but I wouldn't go so far as the best. And I, truthfully, had the same problem with the new one. While I thoroughly enjoyed, that 40 minute period is just straight up boring.I must say that I enjoyed both versions equally and I didn't really see a problem with a remake. It's just a movie, if you don't like the idea of it, don't watch it. Simple.Now for some of the aspects and some miscellaneous comments: For those of you out there who are upset about the butt shot after Anne Heche keels over in the shower...it was originally in the 1960 version. Hitchcock got the shot but never put it in because he knew it would most likely be rejected. So, all Van Sant did was simply fill in what couldn't be shown 38 years ago.No harm in that. As for the masturbation scene...well, I don't know what to tell you about that. It was freaky but most of the people in the theater I went to started laughing at that scene. So, it really didn't bother me. The whole supposed lesbian thing with Julianne Moore's character I never quite picked up...was she supposed to be a lesbian? I heard she was but never saw an indicator...who knows?My basic point is this: It's a remake. Whoopee. The only reason it's being so harshly criticized is because people simply can't believe it was remade SHOT-FOR-SHOT (mostly). So maybe Van Sant shouldn't have done it almost identical to the original. But I don't see it as a big deal, quite personally. It's not a masterpiece but (in my opinion) neither was the original. Hitch made much better movies than this, among them "The Birds," "Frenzy," "Topaz," "Rope," etc., etc....this is just another remake in my opinion. So, basically, just be a little less picky if you watch this and you're a huge fan of the original.</fullReview>

After I got off my Hitchcockian high horse, I ate up this new offering up like bad candy.In the end, I think this film was made for all the "Psycho" enthusiasts out there- a tribute to the ones who know every scene, every line, every nuance, probably like Van Sant himself.

		<fullReview>I have just one question. If you really want to do an homage to Hitchcock's GREAT film Psycho, why not re-release the original in theaters??? It would cost a lot less money, it would make more money, it would be less criticized , and most importantly: it would give younger viewers who have never seen the original a chance to see it THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN!!! I, being born in the '80s and a HUGE fan of the original, would LOVE to see the original on the big screen! But to those of you who say this was a terrible film, you cannot say this truthfully without regarding the original as terrible due to the fact that it is the exact (with a few ridiculous additions) same movie. This movie was not terrible, but instead entirely unnecessary. So Gus Van Sant, you went about your tribute the entirely wrong way. Sometimes, less is more.</fullReview>

To start off with, it is a bad idea to remake a film, let alone a Hitchcock film, especially Hitchcock's greatest film(there's one smack upside the head). Then, instead of bringing his own touch to the film(even that disgusts me), Gus Van Sant decides to use the original script and shoot the film shot-for-shot(there's a second slap upside the head). Then he says the only reasons for doing this is because kids won't watch black and white films(another slap upside the head) and it's an "homage" to Hitchcock(yet another slap upside the head). Four slaps in all. This is the scum under the toilet of the film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am not saying the movie is bad by any means.I loved Hitchcock's Psycho. I still do. So much in fact that it is in my video collection.What I am saying is what is the point? Why make a remake of a classic film if you are not going to change anything? Better yet, why make a remake of a classic in the first place? It is a classic because it can't and shouldn't even try to be improved upon. That would be like making a remake of Gone With The Wind or The Wizard Of Oz. Bottomline, You can't improve perfection.There are so many older movies out there that are good but not classics. These are the movies that could be remade. A good example of this is The Haunting.What went on though in the case of the Psycho remake is nothing but justified plagiarism.I know Hitchcock's Psycho so well that I was able to speak Vince Vaughnn's lines right along with him. As far as originality goes, what can be said?This remake was BOTH the most original and unoriginal remake of a picture that I have ever seen. It is original in the fact that to the best of my knowledge nobody has ever shot a scene for scene word for word remake and it was unoriginal because there was nothing new or fresh brought into the story to throw you off.Bottomline, If you haven't seen the original,treat yourself!If you have seen the original but simply must have color see the remake or wait and pray that they cme out with a computer colorized version of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone justified this waste of film stock by saying current generations did not see the original on screen. Well, why not just re-release it? As both a film student and an actress, I was and still am bewildered by the decision to make this film. Even if it had turned out ok, the director and performers would not be able to take ANY credit for it since they were simply copying what had been done before, but for a few differences that added little to the film.And as hard as the leads tried to reenact every motion and intonation of the original stars, they could not recapture the tragic glamour or boyish charm that Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins brought to their roles, respectively. Anne and Vince did not illicit my sympathy; I found their performances irksome and (naturally) uninspired.The shower scene was not at all more frightening this time. In fact, I almost laughed out loud. Besides, unless you are living in a bubble, you have seen it spoofed so many times in film and on TV that the shock factor has been completely lost. The success of the original was due in part to the painstaking measures that Hitchcock took to keep the plot twist a secret; that element is all but non-existent here.Of course, you have to question the credibility of the few whom liked this film. If you are at all familiar with Hitchcock (and his ego) you would know that he would have been quite displeased with this version, to say the least; as was the majority of today's more jaded viewing audience. I doubt critics will be swallowing their words anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it were not for Gus Van Sant's efforts to recreate Psycho, I probably would have not bothered to watch the original. Unfortunately, people from my generation tend to shy away from the classic films of the past and instead rent modern day action or romance flicks, only to be disappointed. Perhaps Van Sant was aware of this. In essence, what he has done is brought one of the all time greats to a new generation.Of course, if you've seen the original before this one, it will not be as enjoyable. But for someone like me who hadn't, this movie was very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the unexpected timing of events, and the way the roles of protagonist and antagonist changed throughout the film.After watching the 1998 version I immediately went and rented the original, and I have to say I enjoyed it more. The major difference was Perkins. Vince Vaughn made a valiant effort but can hold a flame to Mr. Perkins. Nevertheless, if you tend to avoid black and white oldies, the 1998 version is a good place to start. Then you can decide if you want to see the original. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok, ok... i know this movie isn't a masterpiece, but in my oppinion this movie is better than the original, with all respect, IT'S IN COLOR! that's just one reason why it's much more fun to watch. well, here... let me list them for you... : 1. Vince Vaughn gives you a more softer Norman Bates, (at the beginning...) a more likeable Norman Bates, the kinda guy (keep in mind i mean at the beginning) who reminds you of an innocent little child, yet in the original, Norman Bates seems even at the beginning, an edgy, creepy guy who you wouldn't want to stick around with for a long period of time... 2. In the original... like i said before... it's in black and white. Now maybe i am just not old fashioned, but i know, all those non-color scenes eventually put you to sleep. I know i fell asleep watching the original. In the second one, a beautiful use of colors on things such as clothes, etc. bring less dragging, plain scenes. 3. Don't even attempt to say that this one seems too 60'ish. Trust me... if you even paid attention to the movie, there are many things added to give it a more 90's appeal. like in one scene, the sister says, "Let me go get my walkman" when they were about to go searching for the detective or something, and then, there is an added detail in the "peep hole" scene that definitely wasn't in the first. Anyway, i think this movie didn't really need adjusting for the 90's anyway... ok, ok, this summary is getting quite long, i could list things for hours to come, trust me... but i won't. take my word for it... this is a goooooooooood remake! well, actually, if anyone is not sure rather to rent it or not...my vote? 10/10-- that's right! 10 OUT OF 10!</fullReview>

Van Sant has never been a film-maker who backs away from a challenge and even though I don't agree with remaking the same film in the almost exact same way, the film is very indictive of Van Sant's style. There are some minor differences in the film, the Arbogast character is murdered the same way but the murder is interrupted visually by some strange surreal shots. That is a definite Van Sant touch. Although I don't think any true lover of cinema will give this film a chance, it isn't as bad or blasphemous as some have made it seem.

This film reminded me of some cheesy little film that you would make with your friends.

		<shortDescription>Weird juxtaposition of time/place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original, I didn't expect Gus Van Sant to improve the story with his well-intentioned remake. You have to go back to 1960, when presidents drove around in open-top limos and neighbors didn't lock their doors, to understand the horror generated by the original. It was the first major film to find terror in the face of the nice boy next door, rather than from nuclear holocaust or space invaders.That said, the first thing that hit me was the odd inconsistency in the film's time-set. We're in Phoenix, 1998, with Anne Heche's crop-cut hair, and no one believes in air-conditioning. Huh??? Or, are we in the '60's, as evidenced by the styles worn by detective Arbogast and the no-TV rooms at the Bates Motel? Or, are we back in the '90's, with Julianne Moore's Walkman and backpack?Counter to what many critics wrote, I found Anne Heche outstanding. Maybe she have Janet Leigh's carnality, but her vulnerability came shining through, especially as Norman Bates castigated her for suggesting, oh so very delicately, that "Mother" belongs......"somewhere". Heche came off, to me, as very sexy.Then, there's Vince Vaughn. One of the great things about Tony Perkins was his obvious lack of comfort around women, and his honest attempts to be a sweet guy with nothing to hide. Vaughn, with his linebacker build and irritating little laugh punctuating so many lines, seems to be reading lines.How could he butcher such great and telling lines as "I stuff things"; "Well, a boy's best friend is his mother", and "I hate dampness, don't you? Creepy smell!"? Norman would know, wouldn't he?The film angle used for the confrontation between Vaughn and Viggo Mortenson's good-ole-boyfriend shrinks Mortenson, as Sam Loomis, down to size. Prior to this scene, one can believe what Marion Crane sees in her studly, though slow-witted boyfriend for whom she's risking everything, but the way Vaughn towers over and intimidates him, Mortenson all but disappears.Also, the ominous house on the hill was a character in the original. In the remake, it's too plain, too well-lit, and just there.Finally, if Van Sant meant a note-for-musical note, line-for-line remake or homage, why insert the odd subliminals at the moments of death?One thing Van Sant DID do that was as good as Hitchcock was the morph of Norman's smiling mug with that of Mother, in the final shot of Norman/Mother in the holding cell. For years, I wondered why that final grin of Norman's chilled me so, until I watched it on video, froze the frame, and saw the double-exposure of the two faces.If you've never seen the original, and can't comprehend seeing any film in b&amp;w, then rent the remake. On the other hand, perhaps you should contact Roger Ebert and get a copy of his "Siskel and Ebert" show honoring black and white films, and see what you've been missing. Directors usually CHOSE to film in b&amp;w, contrary to those who believe the studios couldn't afford color shooting. That half hour show gave me an all new appreciation of the art of b&amp;w.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abridged PSYCHO by Gus Van Sant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot-by-shot remake? I don't think so. A close look at the approximate ending sequences will reveal a church scene towards the last 25 minutes or so (of the 1960 film version). When you watch the 1998 version, you will notice that this particular scene was totally cut from the story progression. In the B&amp;W one, the scene is placed after Norman walks downstairs from his Mom's room. The scene in question involves Sheriff and Mrs. Chambers, plus, Sam and Lila. This is (beyond doubt) a very crucial scene in the "PSYCHO" atmosphere of suspense. In the COLOR one, we see: first, Norman descending,second, Sam and Lila in the pickup truck. Why cut such an important scene? I'm guessing it was to shorten the new version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch Would Be Amused, I Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irony of Gus Van Sant's having made an exact duplicate [in color] of "Psycho" would not have been lost on Alfred Hitchcock. The great director of thrillers and mysteries was himself apt to be very experimental. Examples: 1. Using essentially one set in "Rear Window." 2. Ditto "Rope." 3. The technically difficult [at the time] crop duster and Mount Rushmore scenes in "North by Northwest". 4. The stairway tracking shot in "Frenzy". 5. The shower scene in "Psycho," which was considered extremely adult and violent in 1960. 6. The overhead shot in the second murder in "Psycho." 7. The aerial shots at the beginning of "Psycho." 8. Essentially telling a story twice in "Vertigo." 9. The best in the business in making music a part of the story telling, especially in his efforts with Hermann. 10. Use of opening credits art to set the mood, especially in the 1950s and 1960s.The point is that he would laugh at how antiquated the 1998 remake of "Psycho" is. For is he had had access to today's technology, his "Psycho" would have looked entirely different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I did enjoy this remake. It's basically the same movie, so what's not to like? Sure, some people love the original so much it's hard to let go. I am a huge fan of remake films, as long as they're true to the original. For example, I enjoyed Tom Savini's 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead more than the original, and I also liked the 1992 version of Dracula better than any previous effort. It's not that the originals weren't good films, but I was more entertained watching the more modern versions. Some films, I agree should not be touched, such as The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Films as powerful as those could not possibly be improved, let alone matched in a more modern portrayal. Psycho is a film that can be redone in every decade, as it truly tests the passage of time in its magnificence. I do like the original, and I believe it is a classic. However, I appreciate what Gus Van Sant has done for us horror fans, and I would never condemn it because it didn't live up to SOME people's expectations. I don't have anyone else think for me, I suggest you watch it and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in PSYCHO an interesting failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said about George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's affect on modern movies, for better or worse. It seems to me Alfred Hitchcock doesn't get enough credit here. I'd be willing to bet PSYCHO inspired more homages, remakes, rip-offs, or directing styles, than either STAR WARS or JAWS or any of Lucas' or Spielberg's films. Now, Gus Van Sant and company have opted to try the route which is either very brave or very stupid; remake the original shot-for-shot. Which brings up an age-old question which no one has touched on when writing about this remake; is it the script or the director which drives the movie?For the past 30-40 years, the answer has been the director, at least to most critics and even audiences(or, as the Who put it in "Join Together," "It's the singer, not the song/That makes the music move along" Generally, it's Hitchcock who gets all the credit for the film(except the parts grudgingly handed out to Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh), and nothing to Joseph Stefano or Robert Bloch(whose story, later novel, was the basis for the movie). By recasting the story, adding only a few modern details(not enough, as some people have pointed out already, or in the case of the shower scene, too much), and essentially directing it as Hitchcock did, we focus more on the story. And the result?Well, as my lead comment would suggest, it's an interesting failure. Part of the failure comes, of course, because we know all the surprises coming, and so while Van Sant does do a good job of tension(helped by retaining Bernard Herrman's excellent score), we're not shocked like we are in the original. The color does add to the remoteness of the desert(especially since Van Sant and the cinemotographer(I forget who) give the film a bleached look), but the house suffers tremendously, not being anywhere near as frightening as it was in black-and-white). The office also come off worse than it did in the original, just seeming garish.The performances are a mixed bag as well. Unlike many, I thought Anne Heche was perfectly fine as Marion. She doesn't have the strength that Janet Leigh had, but she brings a little more calculation, which helps pull off the scene where she takes the money. Julianne Moore is less callow as her sister Lila than Vera Miles was(I have to admit I'm not a fan of Miles), and brings more determination. And while the role of Arbogast is essentially just a plot device anyone could play, William H. Macy, as others have said, is quite good at it, underplaying during his interrogation to make Norman even more nervous. Oh yeah, and while people have often said the psychiatrist at the end should be deep-sixed, Robert Forster at least speeds it up. Now to the bad; John Gavin was not liked by Hitchcock, but at least you could see what Leigh saw in him, but Viggo Mortenson, who is a good actor(I thought he was terrific in G.I. JANE), comes across as awful here, and since it's a role he seems suited for, he has no one to blame but himself. On the other hand, it's hard to blame Vince Vaughn for his performance as Norman Bates; this is miscasting all the way. The reason Anthony Perkins was so perfect as Norman was because he played him as normal, not crazy, which made him all the more frightening. Vaughn is good in his range(SWINGERS, THE LOST WORLD, and RETURN TO PARADISE all show him off as a heel, though the last two show him either playing off that image, or becoming a good guy), but he's all wrong for the part, since you know there's something dangerous about him as soon as you meet him. Plus, while Perkins had the look of a mama's boy, there's no way you'd believe Vaughn did. Finally, he's too tall.Still, there is something to be said for sticking to the basic story, and using tension instead of just trying to shock us. And I have to admit even though I knew what was going to happen, I did tense up in anticipation. Some have called this a study in PSYCHO. I call it a brave experiment which failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Gus Van Sant was doing a shot for shot remake of Psycho, I thought why bother? Then I saw the previews, and I became curious. So I went to see the movie. Being a fan of the original, I knew where all the shocks were going to be. I was pleased to see that Van Sant was able to do a few things that Hitchcock was unable to do in 1960. Namely, the opening shot of the Phoenix skyline. Hitchcock wanted a long shot that would eventually land on the hotel window, but he didn't have the resoures to pull it off to meet his demands. Vince Vaughn was good as Norman. He added a little more to the role, but he's no Tony Perkins. I did like hearing Bernard Herrman's great minimalist score course through Dolby speakers. Danny Elfman's arrangement was perfect. Overall, see this film if you want to see Psycho in color, but get the original if you have to choose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror, the horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is absolutely dreadful. Vince Vaughn is moronic, Anne Heche looks like she was very sorry she signed up for this gig, Julianne Moore swings between being take charge and flighty, and only William H. Macy doesn't embarrass himself in this waste of time. As one of the other visitors commented, one of the main flaws with this film was the fact that the script is 40 years old and simply cannot translate to the 90's by just updating the amount of money stolen. The motel for example, looked exactly like a early 50's motel and had no TV's in the rooms, though it was supposedly built around 10 years earlier. Of course the motel being so dated allowed for easy searching of the motel whenever someone shows up looking for the missing Anne Heche because all the doors are conveniently unlocked for easy access! That Norman, what a thoughtful guy! Seriously though, do you know of any motels built in the mid to late 80's that don't have TVs and don't have automatically locking rooms unless they're some quaint romantic inn? I didn't think so -- and if you qualify this place as a romantic getaway your standards are low indeed. I can assure you that slapping a couple of credit card stickers in the windows is not an update. Like the visitor who noted the problems with the 40-year-old script, I also had problems with Anne Heche pulling off to the side of the road to sleep alone. Also, thousand dollar bills, which I admit they had to use for ease of transport, haven't been in regular circulation in years. The office where Anne Heche works at the beginning of the movie doesn't have air conditioning -- in Arizona. And much is made of how hot it is. Trust me, it would have been far more believable to say the air conditioner on the fritz than to believe a successful businessman has no air conditioning in his office in Arizona in 1998. And Vince Vaughn slimes through the movie using the same annoying giggle he used in "Clay Pigeons" (I guess it's his all purpose crazy laugh) to substitute for any acting of any kind. And let's face it -- he's well over six feet tall and doesn't look frail in the least bit. Avoid this turkey and see the original. If you must see an homage to "Psycho", the 45 seconds in the Simpsons episode where Maggie knocks out Homer by imitating Itchy and Scratchy cartoons is a million times better and way funnier to boot. The main selling point for fans of the 1998 "Psycho" is that it's in color. They're probably really impressed that it has sound as well. Trust me, nobody needs to see a color film this badly. And if you want to see a bad film in color that desperately, there are tons of rotten flicks that are more entertaining. That whirling sound you hear is Hitchcock spinning in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was dubbed as a complete, scene-for-scene copy of Hitchcock's masterpiece... That it was not. It was also dubbed as a waste of time for movie go-ers who had seen the original... That it was.This remake is strange, and I have no regrets in saying that it was disappointing. Being a huge fan of the original I was very anxious to see this reworking. But while I was watching it I realised that despite being a talented director, Gus Van Sant had very little input to this movie. He was not calling all the shots... Hicthcock was.From beyond the grave Alfred Hitchcock was telling Gus what to do and how to do it. If Gus had changed anything and it wasn't as good as the original then people would have accused him of ruining a great movie. If he made it exactly the same the would accuse him of simply being a thief, stealing a great movie from someone else.Apart from the fact that this movie disappoints "Psycho" fans, I have to look at it from the other perspective. People who haven't seen the original would think that it was simply a good film, probably a bit lame by today's standards.So, I enjoyed seeing "Psycho" on the big screen again, and I don't think that Gus ruined a good movie, but it does seem to be a bit of a waste of movie-making time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant ("Good Will Hunting") thought that a frame-by-frame remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic would be just as good, right? Wrong. Just because the soundtrack from the original "Pyscho" was featured doesn't make it scary, especially for a remake. Vince Vaughn ("Return to Paradise") plays the impure Norman Bates who appears to have so much fun with the character that he forgets his lines -- and it shows. Anne Heche ("Wag the Dog") is poorly casted as Marion Crane. The shower scene has a few flaws: it's longer than the original and has one brief nude scene of Heche. Also, Marion stares at the knife for so long before screaming. William H. Macy ("Fargo") as the detective investigating Marion's disappearance is the only film's saving grace. My evaluation: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone, anyone, should have stopped before they had moved a muscle towards the production of this movie, and asked themselves, "How can I improve upon a masterpiece?" Answer: you can't. So why bother? Psycho (1998) is pointless and badly botched in many ways. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.1) The virtually shot-by-shot remake keeps all of the anachronisms inherent in the original screenplay. Not that the screenplay was anachronistic in 1960, but it is now, 40 yrs. later. Would a single girl driving by herself sleep all night on the side of the road? More than likely, if someone sneaks into a bathroom trying to kill someone in the shower today, she pulls out a gun and shoots him dead. Goodbye, Norman. Psycho preyed on the fears of '50's America; '90's America is very different. It would not have been impossible to have pulled a remake of Psycho off, but it would have to be updated.2) Gus van Sant is not the director to do this job. Was Craven, Sam Raimi maybe, but not Gus van Sant. He specializes in quirky, character studies, and Psycho needs outsized , almost melodramatic emotional punch. Besides, Psycho has already been successfully updated and remade - 1978's Halloween, by John Carpenter.3) The casting is all wrong. Vince Vaughn just comes across as creepy, something Anthony Perkins never did. Perkins performance was definitive and dogged him his whole career. It's impossible to improve upon. Anne Heche is also wrong, she's pixieish, lacking the carnality and voluptuousness Janet Leigh brought to the role. She wouldn't get anybody's juices flowing, even a lonely loser like Norman Bates.4) There's a scene where Norman is watching Marion through the hole in the wall. Wrong. Norman represses his sexual urges; if he had release, he wouldn't have to call on mother to blow off steam. There's an additional scene where Marion's sister is going through Norman's room. Again, wrong. Norman is not a pervert or creepy, he's got much bigger problems than that.5) One of the rationales given for this remake is that today's audiences want to see it in color. Hitchcock could have made the movie in color too, but thought black and white suited the dark material better. As usual, Hitchcock was right.Avoid this stinker, and rent the original. Hitchcock's genius puts almost every director working today to shame, and it shows in every frame.</fullReview>

But "Psycho" is not really 'required watching' for my generation, unlike other older movies such as "Grease" and "Star Wars." Gus van Sant wanted to make a movie with a newer cast, in color, and with special effects that would attract people who hadn't seen the first one. I had not seen the original when I saw Gus van Sant's; after seeing the newer, I immediately rented the older. Although I don't think it compares at all, it is not meant to. Vaughn is no Tony Perkins. Big deal. Kenneth Branagh was also no Laurence Olivier in "Hamlet", but did that make it a Razzie-worthy performance? I particularly liked William H.

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i actually saw Gus Van Sandt's "Psycho", I thought the concept behind the project sounded fascinating. Take the highly influential original, recast it with modern, well-known actors, keep the same screenplay with some minor updating and smoothing of the stilted 60s dialog, film the thing in color--but don't change anything else. In other words, treat the original the way we treat the oft-filmed plays of Shakespeare (you can never have too many film versions of hamlet, can you?). All I could think of after I'd seen the new "Psycho" however was, "WHY?" Why didn't this concept work? Why is this movie so boring? And ultimately: Why was this done at all? Van Sandt's "Psycho" really, really, REALLY sucks. And it sucks for so many different reasons that they were difficult to sort out in my mind. Firstly, even though I love Vince Vaughn as an actor, he was wrong for Norman Bates. Vinny tries hard, but he is simply too big and scary for the part. Unlike Tony Perkins, who merely seemed nerdy and odd (up until the end), Vaughn seems insane and dangerous from the get-go. It's not his fault, though--all the actors are shown to a bad light. For one thing they are reciting a script that, while superficially revised, is actually very dated. The outrageously goofy dialog just doesn't fly in a modern setting. Cornball crap like this needs the "Leave It To Beaver" ambiance of the original to work-and that means, in part, black and white photography. Also, the more naturalistic acting styles of the new cast does not work to the film's advantage, either. It's distracting when paired up with the hitchcock's overly-familiar camera-work and Stephano's cornball 1950's TV style dialog. Suprisingly enough, I discovered that the original Psycho benefitted from the stock cardboard-y characters. Their one-dimensional qualities kept the movie focused entirely on the story; the inexorable movement forward to the suprise ending. The new "Psycho" has none of this momentum. It seems like nothing more than a bad student copy of a great work of art. If my analysis seems incomplete, that's cos it is. Like I said, there's simply too much wrong with this movie to even get it all straight. It is that much of a complete and utter failure.</fullReview>

Anthony Perkins made us think that Norman couldn't hurt a fly, leaving it wide open for the shocking conclusion. In the remake Vince Vaughn is just too menacing. He should have been more subtle with the character. His character parallels to that of Faye Dunaway in "Mommie Dearest". It so over the top, that while at the same time it sucks, it is still entertaining. It's so bad, it's good. Anne Heche is midly believable as Marion Crane. The film's only hope is Julianne Moore but unfortunately too many loopholes in the script make it hard for her to pull through. Overall: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure Gus Van Sant had a thrilling and delightful time following in the footsteps of the Master of Suspense when he undertook his Psycho remake. Unfortunately, we as the audience get saddled with the final result: a train-wreck of a film deficient in nearly every way. Unsuspenseful and utterly unconvincing, I struggled to find anything remotely worthwhile as the movie unspooled. I failed. Roger Ebert suggested that the new version reminded him of watching a provincial stock company try to tackle Broadway material; I wouldn't even go that far. Much has been said about the need to bring the story to a generation that wouldn't likely see the original, but the sort of people who wouldn't bother to seek out Hitchcock's brilliant film don't deserve to see it, and probably couldn't appreciate it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vaughn starts out as a psycho, and there he stays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say this: I was probably never going to like Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. I say this even though I had never actually seen him in anything. I just wasn't prepared for some actor upstart to lay claim to one of the most famous roles in movie history.Having established by prejudice let me just say that I DIDN'T like Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. In fact I don't think I like Vince Vaughn at all.He plays the role like he is winking at all the twelve-year-old girls in the audience. He isn't menacing as much as he is sexually "dangerous" (oooh, everybody shiver). There is no subtlety to his performance, he is an instant whacko. Anthony Perkins was reassuringly calming and comforting in between his manic moments - Vaughn is a complete psycho from the word go. When he brings a light dinner for Anne Heche and proceeds to completely freak her out it is difficult for us to believe that she would even stay the night (she doesn't even eat the sandwich for christ's sake!).In this same scene in Hitchcock's original Anthony Perkins comes across as touchingly disturbed and relatively harmless - he is not an obvious threat. The shower scene is all the more shocking because of this, and one is prepared to believe that it is indeed the mother who performs the crime. I don't think that anybody could have been surprised by the attack in this rehash, and Vaughn is the most likely attacker (cheap wig notwithstanding). I think that people are more likely to pity the mother in this version - having to put up with such a maniac as a son.Another major problem with Vaughn as Norman is his physical stature. In one key scene with William Macy he is the dominant figure. When Macy meets him for the first time (again, Vaughn is an instant nutcase - no interesting textures in this performance) Macy seems to be the put-upon character, Macy seems to be less confident and less assured than Vaughn. In this scene in the original Matin Balsam plays Norman for a fool, someone he can manipulate and milk for information. Anthony Perkins does a brilliant job of degenerating from casual and friendly to angry and upset (Vaughn just goes from psychopathic to psychotic).When Balsam is killed we find it difficult to believe that Norman's Mother would have done it. Norman himself begins to come under scrutiny at this point (he must at least be complicit - his mother hasn't even met Balsam's character). Vaughn's Norman doesn't go anywhere, he starts out as a disturbing, threatening whacko and there he stays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Hitchcock fan, and when I heard of the plans for remaking Psycho I knew no good would come of it. But when the movie finally came out I decided to give Van Sant the benefit of the doubt, and go see it anyway. The movie lived up to all my expectations, in that it was a sorry copy of the original. It would have been far less painful to see a colorised version of Hitchcock's movie. The "modernization" of the story was done by changing a few trivial details ($400,000 instead of $40,000, or showing a walkman), which added nothing. The characters were wooden and emotionless. One gets the impression that nobody cares what actually happened to Marion (especially her sister and boyfriend), all they are interested in is the money. The voyeuristic scene in which Bates peeps into Marion's room and watches her undress would have been far more effective without the gratuitous masturbation, and the addition of the cuts in the murder scenes (clouds, and a cow) would also have been better off on the floor of the cutting room. The original score by Bernard Herrman was chilling and effective, and the reworking done by Elfman was by far inferior. Psycho by Hitchcock is an excellent psychological thriller. Psycho by Van Sant is a slasher movie on par with "Scream"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, after seeing Van Zant's "remake" of the Hitchcock classic last night I could describe it as nothing but utter DRIVEL. Never before have I been so inspired to either walk out of the cinema, start crying, or punch the s**t out of the projectionist. Surely the fat man must be rotating in his grave at a horrendous rate; this remake improves nothing on the original; nothing whatsoever. Firstly, the sheer ham-facedness of Vince Vaughn's acting has to be seen to be believed. Never in film has any actor seem so distanced from his role; he glides through the performance with the passion of Bill Clinton attending a marriage guidance class. And Ann Heche, whilst being slightly better, still proves to be a wooden actor of pinnochio-esque proportions. Of course, the film would be considered as "all right" if the original had never been made, but the very fact that Van Zant has had the sheer audacity to try and better one of the greatest suspense films ever made makes the film seem a great deal inferior to the original. The shower scene itself is an abortion, with no suspense whatsoever, and personally I feel the voyeuristic "peephole/masturbatory" scene is gratuitous and indecent. Coupled with the horrendously bohemian shots of cows and clouds (when the murders are being committed) this whole package reeks of consumerism and an extreme lack of innovation on Van Zant's part. Whatever next? "North By Northwest" in 3D with Leonardo DiCaprio. Next time write your own films, Gus, and take a leaf out of the Good Will Hunting book. The public deserves better than this nonsense. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM- or you will be writing, like me, to the director to demand the 2 hours of your life back that you needlessly threw away watching this claptrap.</fullReview>

Vaughn and Heche are completely miscast. Vaughn not weedy or pathetic enough to be Norman Bates and Heche is not glamorous enough to be Crane. The film is not scary enough by today's standards. You can't remake a classic unless you chuck in special effects. The new Psycho just doesn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the movie purists will have us believe, Psycho is a travesty that knows no bounds. But let us remind them that even Hitchcock's original masterpiece was considered terrible back in 1960. Vince Vaughan plays the Bates role well (how well I wouldn't want to say), with a manic laugh and menacing undertones. Even his attire suggests instability. Heche, playing the role Janet Leigh made famous, again tackles the character well, if a little blandly. But for me, it's Julianne Moore and William H. Macy who liven the picture. Moore, as the concerned sister of Heche is feisty and nosey, and looks gorgeous without the retro garb sported by much of the rest of the cast. Macy, watchable in Fargo and Boogie Nights makes a lasting impression as the private investigator also searching for Heche.As for the film in general, the atmosphere is tense, uneasy. This is from someone who has not experienced the horror of the original, but it can only a good thing. Many of those who will watch the remake (aside from Vaughan fans) are generation of film-goers unfamiliar with the Anthony Perkins original, or even Hitchcock's other work. Maybe it's a travesty, maybe it should have been left untouched, and maybe Vaughan didn't need to be shown masturbating. And maybe the purists are right. But for the Hitchcock virgin, a remake is an accessible introduction to the man's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost 40 years ago a black and white film was made called Psycho. It was a thriller. The new movie is just that: a new movie! Why can't people either go watch it and enjoy it for what it is; a 1998 movie called Psycho, or don't bother going if you think you are going to see the original Norman Bates' actor. Remember, Anthony Perkins died.The movie shows off some fine acting. I am sure all of the characters have watched the original a time or two. Doesn't matter. My point? Well, my father watched television when it first came out. Today, televisions are totally different from the black and white one that he first watched. That doesn't mean that he doesn't enjoy the newer televisions of today.Get with it, movie-goers: give the actors and full cast of this movie a bow. They deserve it! Finally, anyone who saw the original in the movie theatre or at a drive-in theatre is now probably some old set-in-their-way senior citizen by now.A must-see movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some things just have to be clarified. I can not stand to read anymore ignorant comments:1) Hitchcock made a CONSCIOUS DECISION to film in black and white. It had nothing to do with limitations of 1960. Hitchchock made his first color movie in 1949. 1949 people! He wanted Psycho to have a stark, almost film noir look. That's what makes the film so effective!!2) Hitchcock did not stray from graphic violence and nudity because the "censors wouldn't let him do what he really wanted to do". Rather, he knew how to use his tools(of film-making) more effectively than most. The fact that the editing of the shower scene, and the voyeurism scene, is effective and terrifying WITHOUT anything graphic proves his incredible cinematographic ability. He plays tricks on the audience. We want to see Marion naked, but at the point she is naked, we are left to look at Norman's eye. And as Marion is being slashed to pieces, our mind is able to fill in the images between the shots.3) Van Sant's camera work is not "better" because he has new equipment. First of all, though it may have been a little more bulky and difficult to use, they had fine camera equipment in the 60's. Second, every shot in Psycho is brilliant. There is not a wasted frame, not a throwaway blurry camera sweep--the film is composed with the utmost of craft. Again, it is his stark, economical style that makes Psycho so effective. Though some of Van Sants "new" shots (such as the opening) may be more similar to the in your face, action movie-style camera work that modern audiences are used to, it is actually a lot less effective and enduring.Overall, this new Psycho is much more dated than the original. Sure the original is set in the 60's(how could Hitchchock help that?), but it is ultimately a timeless piece of art. A decade or so from now, the goofy bits of pop culture and sexual execess throw in by vans sant will look REAL stupid. Until then, Kudos to the directors who continue to strive toward good, timeless art....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now being a fan of the original, I was kind of weary of dishing out $8.50 to go and see this, but I did anyways. Was I glad? I don't know. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it needed something more to work for the 90's. This movie is set in the 60's still, even though they had a few changes (Heche steals $400,000.00 instead of $4,000), they needed more. And what was with her outfits!!! WHOAH! I thought that Ms. Heche fell out of the 60's. I thought I was watching "Pleasantville" for a minute!! And I did not find Vince Vaughn creepy at all. I found myself getting a crush on him, with that cute little giggle and his little grin. Only one scene had any shock value for me (concerning the detective). .I jumped. Whoo-hoo. A movie needs more than that. This movie was cool in the 60's, but in the 90's we have all been desensitized to this kind of tame violence. I was bugging my friend who came with me because he was bored out of his mind in the movie. I told him he was bored because nothing blew up in the movie. He agreed. Kinda sad, huh. He didn't like it cuz he said it was too "talky" for a horror movie. I told him it wasn't a horror movie, that it was a psychological thriller. He told me that "Single White Female" was a psychological thriller. And that is what summed it all up for me. Hollywood doesn't need to reshoot the old Hollywood classics frame by frame for the enjoyment of the "new generations" because they won't enjoy it. They want to see a lot more blood and violence, things that make them jump and scream. "Aliens" can do that, "Scream" can do that, hell even "I Know What You Did Last Summer" can do that. So did I enjoy it, scale of 1-8, i give it a 6. And that is mostly for the acting skills of Julianne Moore &amp; Vince Vaughn.</fullReview>

Gus Van Sant does a great job of recreating the most terrifying movie ever. OK, so maybe the masturbating of Bates (notice that) could have been omitted with no one caring, it made the movie no worse.The murder of Marion (the famous shower scence) was great and Arbrogast got his face torn up!

		<shortDescription>A deeper Purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big critical whining that has centered around Gus Van Sant's Psycho(1998) is the idea that there is no need to remake a practically flawless film. At the outset that seems like the right thinking. Hitchcock's original was a masterful display of sadistic mind games, not to be imitated. However, the imitation here is for a two-fold purpose: To reinterpret the film for a new generation, and to educate those ignorant of the original, ultimately re-igniting Hitchcock's version. Granted, some of the "new interpretations" are a bit risque and grotesque (the masturbation scene, the spider crawling out of a dead corpse's mouth),but this is the 90's; we crave disgust. What Van Sant really does though is take a classic and try to bring it to an audience feeding on $200 million dollar movies about a stupid ship that we know is going to sink. With a touch of 90's roughness, Psycho, the film we all know, gains a mission: education.</fullReview>

Technically it is bothersome. I noticed a number of scenes that seemed to start in broad daylight and end looking like the middle of the night. Maybe Hitchcock did that too but we couldn't tell cause of the black and white. Then there were the addition of subliminal scenes at certain points...why? And I realize they were trying to update it...but Julianne Moore seemed to have an unnatural attachment to her Walkman which was highly intrusive. I felt that by staying so close to the original this remake suffered. it added nothing new and yet seemed to be trying to be different.

		<fullReview>A film of a book is an adaptation or an interpretation. That is pretty standard practice. Anyone who has read the Robert Block novel, Psycho, knows that Hitchcock took great liberties with the characters and story to make his movie. This is often a dis-service to great literature, but in this case, Hitchcock found in this unremarkable little thriller the elements of a great suspense film and added a touch of terror he'd never attempted before. His decisions to make a black and white film using the crew from his television show and actors with little or no box office draw had as much to do with atmosphere as economics. But all that aside, he took a calculated risk to make this his new vision of horror. That is the hallmark of creativity and of an artist. Psycho 1998 is not a film of a book. It is a film of a film of a book. There is nothing here to indicate that this group even knew about the Bloch novel. Regardless of the technical attention to detail or the updating of characters, this was not a book that was "discovered" and brought to life or the long awaited adaptation of a best seller. Ultimately it is only what it is... another assembly line film made for $$$ only. A year after it hits video it will be a catalog item at Blockbuster and then a $1.00 rental. Hitchcock's film stand alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when i heard the rumor this was being remade..i ran to the video store and picked up the original. and was amazed...perkins was terrifing as norman bates, the movie was so stylish, so simple..so scary. and to my surprise..no nudity, no cursing, no rated R. then as a new fan, i saw the van sant's Psycho this weekend. to be honest..i'm trying to like it. but the only things i find in it that were good was the music (danny elfman is the spookiest) the direction..which surprised me in the shower scene which i also liked a lot. in my opinon Vaughn was terrible he looked like he knew he was filling big shoes, and failing. what i liked about perkins was i didn't know he was crazy...Vaughn's bates was too obvious. Did anyone else see the quick flashes when he murdered Heche and Macy? What was that all about?i liked it, i just didn't understand its purpose..like the mastubation scene..just wasn't needed at all. After that happened he lost all his terror in for the crowd i was with. it's hard to enjoy a scary movie when people are walking out...why didn't Van sant just try to re-release it?? my advice if you took the time to read my words of wisdom? rent the original...and check out the new one, is was a good effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Originality??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the original Psycho, before watching this new one. It's not a bad film, but it's not exactly groundbreaking either. Van Sant didn't offer anything new, except for a few scenes (beating the meat) and some additional footage of Norman's visions when killing his victims.Those scenes were hardly necessary and were uncalled for. And I personally thought Julianne Moore's acting needed an improvement.So the bottom line is that if you haven't watched the original and you watched this movie, you probably liked it, but otherwise you might be disappointed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a remake, just recolorized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original Psycho when I was about 12. I was surprised to see that a black and white horror film can still be somewhat entertaining. 3 years later I go to the movie theater not sure what to expect. Gus Van Sant, I thought would pull off another good film since he created Good Will Hunting. I sat down to watch Psycho and enjoyed it. I enjoyed it about the same amount as I did seeing the original. Honestly, there is no difference between the two except that the new one is recolorized.I always hated black and white pictures so I did enjoy the newer one by a tad. But if I had watched the original a thousand times like some addicts, then I would have been expecting everything and I would have been disappointed by the lack of new ideas. There was more violence in the newer one, but not more killing. The shower scene had more of a modern scare and a lot more blood. If your a huge fan of Psycho then you might want to see this one. If you're looking to see a fresh movie then wait for tape because the only thing this Psycho has to offer is color.Rating: 8 out of a 10 for the movie in general0 out of a 10 for fresh new ideas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho 98 mini Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Psycho 98 yesterday, and being a big fan of the original I wanted to share my thoughts with others. I had fun watching the film, (very minor spoiler) enjoyed the added stuff in the peephole and shower scenes. But I really think the film has problems up until the car exchange scene (when Crane trys to bolt off). It just seemed kind of slow (even slower than the orig). To me many of the actors seemed like they were 'phoning in' their lines... even Macy at times! The only quality acting seemed to come from Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche as they were terrific as Bates and Crane. Vaughn did a different more child-like, giggling, hand twisting version of Norman, which was a relief as I really wanted him not to even try to touch Perkins Norman... and he really didn't, he provided us with similar yet different Norm, which I liked. Heche was very close to Janet Leigh almost down to the smallest detail, which was ok too as she was able to pull it off, and the role was fairly straight ahead to start with. The rest of the cast really could have learned their lines a bit better, and some of the pacing seemed a little odd. Macy was very good at points and not so good at others, I just couldn't stop thinking about him in Fargo, because his voice was very similar, and as we know that character was a loser.Another HUGE problem in my eyes is the fact that it was set in 1998. I really have a hard time believing that Norman Bates, a child-like loner who does very strange things to dead birds (and other things once living) is able to go to the local hip shoppe and purchase cool black 3/4 length sleeve turtlenecks or $100 whacky pattern shirts. The only time Norm looked like Norm was when you first meet him, the next two wardrobe changes are ridiculous. Also was it just me or did everyone's wardrobe look stupid in general? I think the wardrobe folks on this pic need to re-think the way they dress actors in movies, because it really sucked. The only other problem with the fact that it's set in present day is the dialog... it really didn't sound like the kind of things people say today, except perhaps "Let me get my Walkman." Should have kept it in the 60's.I guess it sounds like I'm kind of trashing this film, but I'm not because I did enjoy it and will purchase it when it's released on DVD/VHS, the moments where things gel in this film were great fun to watch. Hell, I had a lump in my throat while watching the reworking of the shower scene, all the way up to the submerging car in the swamp... it really worked for me. So say what you will about this film, I still like Perkins as Norm and the orig is the ORIG, but this was fun and may get some folks interested in Hitch who may have never bothered... I know the original Psycho is what made me rent N/NW, Rope, TMWKTM, Frenzy, Birds, Rear Window and many others by Hitch so I don't see why this movie can't do the same thing for those who have yet to have the same experience/revelation I did fifteen or so years ago.Psycho (1998 ) ***/**** CenobYte</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost some Layers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this remake of Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho to be enjoyable and entertaining. When examined closer, however, especially in comparison to the original, this carbon copy lost many of its layers. That's just what happens when things are copied, they lose something.First of all, I found it cumbersome to overcome obstacles caused by not making the film more modern. For example, Marion's wardrobe appeared to stay in the 60's while all others had moved on. She practically had the same wardrobe as Mother Bates. Also I found it annoying when it became apparent that it was requirement to exit an auto from the passenger's door. Details such as these broke up the continuity of the film.Some layers just seemed to be overlooked completely. The transformation of Marion's lingerie from white to black was nowhere in sight. This version is devoid of such symbolism. Also, her shower, before interrupted, didn't have the appearance of cleansing of sin as in the original. Here, it appeared as simply the mundane and ritualistic.Vaughn's performance was full of quirks and idiosyncrasies, just as it should. He portrayed Norman Bates chillingly believable. Heche, on the other hand, did not fair as well. Hitchcock strove for a character with which the audience could understand, and even sympathize with. Heche portrayed a Marion with whom no one could feel sorry for or understand; therefore her outcome is quite less shocking. Macy gave a superb performance as Arbogast, as did the remaining supporting cast. Despite its loss of layers, I found this remake of Psycho to be enjoyable, though not worthy of further analyzation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good movie! I recommend seeing it. I didn't see the first "Psycho" and I was shocked by this one. The main plot twist is amazing and shocking. It's obvious who our bad guy is but this is made up for by the unveiling mystery that unfolds. Vince Vaughn gives a great performence and seems made for the role. I was very impressed. Anne Heche could have done a better job and doesn't desearve the top billing. Overall, its gets a 6 on my scale-o-meter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitch is one of my favorite all-time directors so I was really prepared to dislike this flick. BUT Van Sant did a fine job of paying homage to Alfred. Highlights: the great Saul Bass credits (gets you going immediately); Hermann's wonderful, eery music; the colors (who would have thought of having the Anne Heche character in those wacky orange colors...but they work); Heche in another solid acting job; Bill Macy; Forster. And a good try from Vince in the Norman Bates role. His giggle is "fun" but who can ever forget Tony Perkins in a role that really made your skin crawl. The only downside is something totally of Van Sant's control: there is no suspense per se once you've seen the film and know the denoument. All in all, very entertaining!</fullReview>

Being a big fan of any of Alfred's films I found this movie a DELIGHT!!! I actually even found Vince Vaughn a little more terrifying than Anthony Perkins. Especially the scene in Norman's parlor with Marion. Really intense! A lot of people will not like this movie. I could tell before I saw it.

		<fullReview>Well... it's the same movie, in color. I enjoyed watching it, just as I would enjoy watching the original. The color is nice to look at. The performances are good (especially Heche and Vaughan). But still the question is... why?Van Sant says we should remake movies just like we re-stage Shakespeare plays. Well, guess what? You can't rent a live performance, that's why you have to do them again. A film is a finished thing that everyone can see. The other thing is... even if it's good, Van Sant can't take any credit for it, because it's just a recreation. I guess Universal has a lot of money to throw away.Van Sant also said that he wants to bring this movie to a new generation. Well, I think if so he needed to write a new version of the same story, because film pacing and effects have come so far, this film feels too slow to young audiences. Most people in my audience said "That's it?" and "That's not scary!" at the end. So... Van Sant has assured that all of those people will NEVER watch the original!So, well-done recreation, but it's still as pointless at it seems.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The differences are too much to bear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Psycho copies Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) almost exactly shot-for-shot. Not only is this a poor excuse for a "new" film, it severely lacks the precision and suspense prevalent in Hitchcock's films. The main discrepancies between the old and new Psycho, which drastically change the overall effect of the film, are fourfold. First is the difference between black and white and color; second is the different feeling the new actors brought about as opposed to the original film; third is the movement of the camera and characters in a space; and finally are the minor additions and deletions of elements or scenes incorporated into the film by Van Sant. It's not the fact that Gus Van Sant made the film in color that is bad, it is the fact that it is in color at all. Hitchcock made the film in black and white for a reason. It wasn't like he didn't have the technology to produce a color film (North by Northwest (1959) was made a year before). Black and white was the contrast between Norman Bates and his mother. Black and white created the mysterious shadows of the Bates' mansion and the dark silhouette of Norman Bates behind the shower curtain. Black and white was the struggle between good and evil. Color lacks these things and creates a more muddied appearance of the world of Psycho. Van Sant may have been portraying the difference between the 90's and the 60's, but was it worth it to sacrifice the significance black and white had in Hitchcock's film? It's not the same. The audience is more likely to laugh at Van Sant's film than Hitchcock's. Black and white is more serious. Anne Heche, on the other hand, does not look too serious. Every time the camera is close to her, the subtle smirk painted on her face looks as if it will burst into a laugh at any second. No one watching can possibly take her seriously as an innocent victim. Vince Vaughn also is untrue to the character of Norman Bates. Vaughn is big and muscular, whereas Anthony Perkins looked skinny and weak. In the new film, it looks like Bates is used to carrying dead bodies around. Of course, in both films it shows Norman carrying his mother's body down the stairs and mentions that he has carried it to the cellar before, but that is the only physical labor he would do. A fleshless body can't weigh that much. Perkin's body was more suited to the character of Norman Bates, especially because mentally ill people (and very intelligent people) are often frail and decrepit in other films. Vaughn looked more like a dumb college football player than a psycho mastermind. His movements also fit this big, stupid football player look. He moved about the space of the screen like he owned it, tromping all over everything. Perkins treated everything more delicately, as if his weak body would collapse if it was strained too much. This also let us know that Hitchcock was in control, not the actors. Mortenson, who played Sam Loomis, the lover of Marion Crane, also abused space in this way. His cowboy-like strut looked very sloppy compared to Gavin's portrayal of the character in 1960. Gavin walked like a soldier, following the exact path appointed to him by Hitchcock. The camera also moved in this manner in the original Psycho. Every motion of the camera and characters was precise. Van Sant has created some kind of free-for-all, carrying us through a violent ocean rather than the log flume we ride when watching Hitchcock's film. The masturbation scene shows where that violent ocean can lead. Where did Van Sant get the idea to include that in the film? He further expounds on this by showing a porno magazine laying around Norman's room. The real Bates would not have gone that far. The evil of thinking lustfully after a woman was bad enough for mother. Bates wouldn't have even thought of masturbating. He was a man of intense thought; such a physical expression of his thoughts would be inhibited. It was his mother who murdered people, not Norman. His job was to think and change the linens. All of these things contributed to ruining Psycho, but perhaps nothing was worse than the line, "Let me get my walkman." Lila Crane said this at the hardware store to Sam before leaving for the sheriff's house. There are other ways to show the new Psycho takes place in the 90's than by adding stupid, out of place lines like, "Let me get my walkman." Every line in the original Psycho served a purpose. Van Sant has thrown in a line that serves absolutely no purpose. It has been concluded that Van Sant has inappropriately added things to the film. He has also succeeded in taking things out. Minor changes can easily be found in each scene, but the most significant was the scene when the guy at the police station was explaining how Norman Bates' mind worked. In Hitchcock's version, there is a road map on the wall behind this man. In Van Sant's film there is not. The map is there to ease the audience. They're finally seeing the big picture. The map is a reassurance that no major details in the explanation are being left out. Gus Van Sant does not give this reassurance, except for reassuring us that no one can create a suspense film like Hitchcock. Even copying the master of suspense shot-for-shot has resulted in a film that betrays Hitchcock and his style of controlled suspense brought about through restricting elements of film, rather than proliferating them like Gus Van Sant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit; I was one of the many fans of the original PSYCHO who thought that Gus Van Sant's idea for a remake was one of the stupidest ideas I'd ever heard of. But as I saw the previews, and read interviews with the director and lead actors, I became intrigued to see it. (As a curiosity and nothing more.) Now that I've seen it, I'm a little confused as to what the hostility is all about. It's a well-crafted experiment. Far from holding a candle to the suspense of the original, it works just fine as a curiosity. I actually enjoyed seeing modern clothing and a redressed Bates Motel and home with the same script (and especially music) from the original.But I think that both Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn missed the subtleties of their characters which made the original work. Janet Leigh's Marian was so torn about what she had done that you wondered what she was going to do next. Anne Heche didn't seem quite as disturbed. When Norman makes dinner for Marian in the original, you felt that Norman was a sweet troubled guy, and you almost thought that something might develop between him and Marian. And it's his conversation with her that makes her decide to return the money and face the music. In the new version, Norman is so wacky you just feel that she wants to get the hell away from him as soon as possible. I suppose that no-one alive can really go into this film not knowing the ending, or that Marian never makes it back to Phoenix, since the film has entered that Pop Culture area where even if you've never seen it, you know it. But still, I would have liked to have seen more complexity in the Marian/Norman relationship. Julianne Moore and W.H.Macy were superb as always.I've heard in defense of this remake that since plays are re-done over and over with new interpretations, why not movies? It's an interesting idea. What if Gus Van Sant made a new Psycho with the same SCRIPT, but with new visuals, music and pacing, and bolder interpretive choices from the actors. (Julianne Moore, for example, gave a very solid performance which was different from Vera Miles' using basically the same words.) After all, every remounting of a play doesn't use the same sets, blocking, lighting and music. It's the script that is the same from production to production. Maybe someone will try that with another old classic movie. Anybody want to give Casablanca a shot? I don't think so. Because plays are LIVE and can never be recreated exactly unless you put them on film or tape. Whereas I can go to my VCR and pop in Casablanca and watch a movie that is just as perfect now as it was nearly 50 years ago. Why remake that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An homage to a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very easy to dismiss Van Sant's recreation of a Hitchcock classic as egotistic and self-gratifying. Especially because the film is virtually identical to Hitch's, from the Saul Bass title sequence to the choreography of the infamous shower scene, we ask "Is this really necessary?" For those who ask why, I ask why not? Van Sant surely can get the funding and because of the excellent material the film will certainly at least break even. The film is not an act of one-upmanship, but rather an homage to a revered director. That being said, I must admit the big disappointment in Van Sant's film is the acting of Vince Vaughn; his performance is more comical than creepy. His effort to introduce a nervous laugh into Bates' character is a testament to his inability to act as subtly as his late counterpart. In addition,in the tradition films like Strangers on a Train and Rope, the ambiguity of the murderer's sexual orientation is an important complexity in Hitch's characters. Van Sant carelessly assumes Bates' hetrosexuality and affirms it with the scene of masturbation and the revelation of Norman's bedtime reading material. Like the overacting, of Vaughn, the remake of Psycho suffers from a lack of subtlety found in the original. The new cross-cutting in the two murder scenes are provocative, but as a whole, Van Sant leaves less to interpretation.</fullReview>

Whereas I can go to my VCR and pop in Casablanca and watch a movie that is just as perfect now as it was nearly 50 years ago. Why remake that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question that nags about Gus Van Sant's shot-for- shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller is Why? Why remake it? Why remake it shot-for-shot? Van Sant might have us believe it is to make this classic accessible to younger audiences, presumably those who refuse to watch a black and white film. My answer to that is, Screw 'em. When they get older and learn the beauty of black and white cinematography, then they will be even more the happy to discover Hitch's masterpiece. No, the only truly genuine reason Van Sant can have to remake the film is that it is an exercise. A test, if you will. Why? Because no one else has ever done it really. In this, and only this way, is "Psycho" a redeemable film. It sparked conversation and interest and debate among filmgoers. That is its true genius. Like Warhol's films of the 60's, Van Sant fashions a film that is ever moreso interesting to discuss than it is to view. The classic is 100-fold better. So - what's different about the remake. Well, for one, it's in color. Big whoop. The original is much more frightening and terse because it is in gloomy black-and- white. It can go a little further sexually. Why bother? The shower scene in the original "Psycho" works because it shows only glints of naked flesh. Van Sant, wisely, does not get more graphic in his version anyway. He does allow a little more sexuality in the opening segment which finds Marion Crane (Anne Heche) in a seedy hotel with her boyfriend. He also has Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) masturbate as he spies on Marion Crane. A friend told me this only evoked teenage giggling at the showing he attended. Hitch would probably spin at that. For all the ground Van Sant might have gained with the more "relaxed" sexual sensibilities in the 90's, he loses in the manner in which the script does not work in this context. The supposed sexual represssion Vaughn represents seems out of date. The whole plot involving Marion and her married boyfriend does not work by today's morality. It all seems so dated. Worse yet is some of the dialogue that is so dated but which Van Sant refuses to update. When the client who drops the load of cash at Marion's work (Chad Everett) mentions that the office has no air conditioning, it seems unbelievable to us. What kind of creep is Marion working for who doesn't have A/C in Phoenix in 1998? That's crazy! It only detracts from the film. Which leads to the biggest question of all: Why didn't Van Sant completely rework the film for 90's audiences and give it his own style. Maybe it's because he isn't the man for the job, (and no, neither is DePalma). Someone like Ridley Scott or David Lynch could do wonders with it, however. Still, Van Zant's interpretation of "Psycho," I feel, would be imminently more interesting than this reshoot. One of the things that truly ruins the film is the casting. The most obvious is Heche as Marion Crane. She has none of the smouldering sensuality or melancholia that Leigh brought to the character. She seems nervous and antsy. She's quirky. It simply does not work. Even worse is William H. Macy in the role of Arbogast. Martin Balsm has a sly coolness about him that made his private detective much more dangerous and crafty than Macy's neurotic hiccup could ever be. Van Sant substitutes cool with quirky in the casting and it does not work. And while Vaughn is an inspired choice to play Norman Bates, ultimately he fails - and for the opposite reason. He is not fragile enough, not nerurotic enough. I'll give him this, as usual, Vaughn works his a-s-s off. It's just that, ultimately, he disappoints, weighed down much too much by the material. As for the others, Viggo Mortenson does nothing, Juliana Moore plays Lila Crane as a lesbian, Rita Wilson is no Pat Hitchcock, and the rest don't do much at all. Robert Forster as the psychologist who explains it all at the film's epilogue comes across as silly because he explains things that are in our American Lexicon of knowledge now (multiple personality disorder) which were not in 1960. In fact, it is the original which put those concepts in popular culture's Encyclopedia to begin with. Forster's performance is more subdued than the original but still needs to be updated for modern audiences. (I saw the film with a teenager who had not seen the original and knew it was MPD at the shower scene). The only characters which truly work are the ones who almost precisely recall their predecessors: James Remar as the cop who finds Marion asleep on the side of the road and Anne Haney as the Sheriff's wife are perfect because they perfectly encapsulate even more than just the essense of their originators, they imitate they originators and that's what Van Sant is supposedly attempting here. Phillip Baker Hall as the sheriff would be included in this ideal but he does not ennunciate the name "Ar-Bo-Gast" as was done in the original and this, more than anything else in the film, is the apex of disappointment. The only truly interesting thing about the remake is the title sequence. Again, exactly in the style of the original, Van Sant chooses the color green to permeate the sequence. It looks awesome. Better yet, the director hires Danny Elfman to "re-make" Bernard Herrmann's original score in wonderfully crisp digital quality sound. It's the best part of the film. When watching it, one actually becomes eager with the anticipation of the film which is to come. The score is, surprisingly, beautiful. And its familiarity makes it seem both classic and suspenseful all at the same time. Unlike film, which should obviously not be copied frame for frame, music is often much more interesting and delightful when it is "re-made" note-for-note. I remember when I was a child and an art teacher told me that in the East (she probably said in China) an artist who can precisely duplicate the original masters are considered great. This seemed like a ridiculous notion to me. If being a great artist meant copying the work that came before you, no new art would ever be produced. What a ludicris concept. We in the West pride ourselves on our great versatility and originality. We cannot even begin to fathom why someone would copy a classic film shot-for-shot. Van Sant's "Psycho" does not begin to hint at an answer. Like the proverbial mountain- climber, Van Sant's response to the question "Why?" seems to be, "Because it was there." The best thing one can say about this film is that like his film "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues," Van Sant's "Psycho" is an interesting failure. It is an important film because it is a first, in its own perverse way, an original. Let's just pray it does not start a trend. I'm not interested in seeing Tamara Davis' "Citizen Kane" starring James Earl Jones.Note: Also with Rance Howard, James LeGros. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch.Heche claimed in interviews that Hitch's daughter, Pat, who had a minor role in the original, visited the set and proclaimed that the project was something her father would have done. She is thanked in the film's end credits.Major differences: Color photgraphy, Bates masturbates, Van Sant uses a technique during the film's two murders of cutting away briefly to strange shots. When Bates kills Marion, a couple of seconds of rolling clouds are cut into the shower scene (ruining any tension Van Sant might have established) and when he kills the Private Detective, a shot of a woman and a cow are cut into the sequence. This does not work. Also, Bates stabs Arbogast twice instead of once, causing a bloody X to appear on his face. Moore works at a hard core metal record shop and wears headphones throughout the film. When Moore tours Norman's room, in addition to all the toys, she finds a nudie magazine. When Moore gets in the cellar and locates the mother, there are live birds in front of her (the one truly interesting and creepy thing Van Sant does here). One wonders how much of this was in the "original shooting script" by Joseph Stefano which Van Sant claimed to use</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K...the reasons why this movie makes me want to return my food from my stomach are: (1) classic movies should not be remade, because there are excellent scripts out there, and why take the chance to ruin a good thing; (2); it is filmed with actors and actresses that could never compete with such talent as Anthony Perkins and Vivien Leigh, and their decision to be in this film proves that they lack the interest in film as an art form (3); it is filmed in color, which takes away from the universal embolism that black and white has to offer, and we see to much blood, which distracts our real fears and transmits them into baseless gore. So we say "yuck" instead of jumping out of our seats. (4) It blatantly talks and shows different instances of sexuality, but the original showed implications of it, which did not distract us from the tone and plot of the story. IT'S A THRILLER!!!(5) It's just plain boring. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM...FEED THE HOMELESS...READ A BOOK...WATCH THE OLD VERSION...but please don't waste your intelligence on this gimmical movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An homage to a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very easy to dismiss Van Sant's recreation of a Hitchcock classic as egotistic and self-gratifying. Especially because the film is virtually identical to Hitch's, from the Saul Bass title sequence to the choreography of the infamous shower scene, we ask "Is this really necessary?" For those who ask why, I ask why not? Van Sant surely can get the funding and because of the excellent material the film will certainly at least break even. The film is not an act of one-upmanship, but rather an homage to a revered director. That being said, I must admit the big disappointment in Van Sant's film is the acting of Vince Vaughn; his performance is more comical than creepy. His effort to introduce a nervous laugh into Bates' character is a testament to his inability to act as subtly as his late counterpart. In addition,in the tradition films like Strangers on a Train and Rope, the ambiguity of the murderer's sexual orientation is an important complexity in Hitch's characters. Van Sant carelessly assumes Bates' hetrosexuality and affirms it with the scene of masturbation and the revelation of Norman's bedtime reading material. Like the overacting, of Vaughn, the remake of Psycho suffers from a lack of subtlety found in the original. The new cross-cutting in the two murder scenes are provocative, but as a whole, Van Sant leaves less to interpretation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock made art when he made Psycho. Acting, sets, dialogue, and photography were the tools he used to create his vision of horror and suspense. It is difficult for me to understand what Van Sant was trying to communicate with his remake, except maybe to PROVE that Hitchcock was really quite good at his craft. And also why it doesn't make much sense to attempt to "duplicate originality". If you've never seen the first one, then this movie isn't that bad for its genre. The sum of its parts just don't make a whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie over the weekend and it was absolutely great! Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche did an excellent job portraying classical characters, but especially Vaughn. He made Norman Bates a truly disturbed and psychotic character. I am a great Hitchcock fan and was skeptical of a remade Hitchcock film but I thought that this film was superbly done. The director combined 1960's atmosphere with the 90's sophistication. Hitchock is timeless...but this film was done so that it could also appeal to a 90's audience.It retains Hitchcock's brilliance with new and exciting footage--especially the shower scene where we see scenes that Hitchcock wanted to use but couldn't because of 1960's censure. Great flick--a must see.</fullReview>

Somehow I must have missed that line in the original version. I got the feeling that Gus Van Sant couldn't quite decide what to update to 1998 and what to leave as completely original. The office where Anne Heche/Janet Leigh worked was identical, including only having air conditioning in the boss' inner office, but then there are dumb little things like that Walkman line.

		<fullReview>this was a stupid pointless remake of a classic. i hated the colours and costumes. anne heche, who gave an okay performance, looked either like a boy or a chicken depending on the scene. she's supposed to be sensuous, and i'm sorry but a buzz cut doesn't make sensuality. the colours and style of the clothes were out of whack as well as outdated in some cases and out of character. vince vaughn claims he didn't want to play norman like mr. perkins but then why did he play up the fact that perkins was gay? norman was supposed to be normal on the outside but vaughn made him nervous and not as sexually repressed as he's supposed to be. he was altogether too flamboyant with his clothes and walk and often his voice and laugh were out of character. the framing and composition was bad. and the ad libbing of Julianne Moore's character was out of place and unwarranted. it was also a massacre to the original to have norman masterBATE to Marion. for christ's sake, he was repressed and had his mom "watching" him all the time. he wouldn't be jerking off. Abergaste was played unrealistically. which is sad, because william h. macy is a good actor. this movie had lots of good actors they just all sucked in this movie. the only redeeming factor in this "film" was that it had a couple of nice shots. the shots with the deer that tended to interrupt a few scenes were pointless, and well, interrupting. and so was the fact that there was absolutely no suspense nor build up of tension in this movie. the voyeuristic feel of this movie was lost and the fact that this was shot in colour didn't help. this was a stupid pointless remake. and a waste of my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in expecting the movie to fall short of Hitchock's masterpiece and was not surprised. Although Van Sant showed a lack of creativity in the actual making of the film (90% of dialogue and camera shots were identical to the original's), the concept of a shot-for-shot recreation deserves some artistic credit. The factor that was overlooked was that the world has changed in the last 40 years and what was good then isn't necessarily good any more. All in all, the film is worth seeing if you're interested in comparing the two versions. But if you haven't seen the original or are just looking for entertainment, you're better off staying home and renting Hitchock's version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of the comments given miss the point entirely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Van Sant is an extremely gifted director -- see "My Own Private Idaho" for comparison. The problem is that what Van Sant is attempting is to remake -- shot-for-shot -- another (brilliant) motion picture. This is not "remaking" a picture, which implies taking a new angle on the same story, but rather "copycatting" another director's work. Not creative, but duplicative. True, there are some elements here which are new (color, Norman masturbating while watching Marion Crane in the shower), but these are relatively minimal. As a result, Van Sant forsakes the one thing that makes a true director -- creativity -- to supposedly do something no one else has done -- copy Hitchcock shot for shot.Moreover, the shot-by-shot remake misses the point. One of the things that made the original so brilliant was due to Anthony Perkins performance, in which his character appears seriously disturbed, but not particularly dangerous. Remember, Anthony Perkins had never played anyone quite like that before; the closest was his portrayal of Jimmy Piersall, a baseball player had a nervous breakdown, in 1957's "Fear Strikes Out." By contrast, casting Vince Vaughan (admittedly a truly gifted actor) does not convey the same disturbed innocence that Perkins could. Indeed, Vaughan's physical build and his menacing looks throw any semblence of surprise to the uninitiated out the window. His preceding performance (funny and scary as it was) in "Clay Pigeons" doesn't help matters much.I have no problem with remakes (though I wish Hollywood would put as much effort into making original films), but a remake should convey an original concept or read on a film. Otherwise, you could do just as well by watching the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoulda let well enough alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just gotta tell ya, this movie stinks. Bad. Went to see it today (with about 12 other people), and it's just plain awful. It does seem to be a faithful recreation of the original, complete with the same music and sounds and shots; which is, depending on your point of view, either a cool idea for an homage, or, (and this is along the lines of what I'm thinking at the moment), yet more proof that Hollywood has no balls (or original ideas).I think the problem lies partly with the fact that this just isn't a 90's film. With all of the gory hack and slash horror films that have come out in the past 15-20 years, this film's attempted painful build-up of pure brain-terror just doesen't cut it. What in 1960, under the direction of a master filmmaker, was almost unbearable suspense, is, in 1998, with Gus Van Sant (a guy who had the luxury of a tremendous script last time out), was drudgery of a level enough to nearly clear the already almost empty theatre I was sitting in not long after Anne Heche died in the shower (with a lot more nudity than I remember from the original...but hey, it's the 90's).The other big problem...no Anthony Perkins. Vince Vaughan is so embarrassing; but just think "masturbation" as an example of both Vaughan's unintentional comic performance and Gus Van Sant's occasional drifting from the blueprint. Don't waste your time by going to see this movie, any more than I'm going to continue to waste mine by writing more of a review of a film that clearly just does not deserve the attention.Stick with the real McCoy, the 1960 version. Don't bother with this colorless carbon copy of 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not a great big fan of the original. So I don't consider it a sacrilege to think that this remake could possibly be better than the original.The one thing that both the original and the remake have against them is that since the movies big surprises are part of pop culture, I already knew them by the time I had seen the movie.To be honest, one of the motivating factors for me to see this movie was all the talk of the nudity added to the film. As an admirer of Anne Heche, I was particularly looking forward to the shower scene. The shower scene was extremely well done, but for those of you who might be checking it out for the nudity, don't bother. What they show doesn't make it at all worth while.I admired the unwavering faithfulness to the original film (with a few exceptions- the most notable of which is that I don't recall Anthony Perkins' Norman to have been shown masturbating at any point in the original. Vince Vaughn's Norman is heard to be masturbating as he's spying on Anne Heche.)There were other aspects of the movie I liked as well. The performances were all uniformly good. The music score is masterful and well-used. The use of color is actually a good addition to the movie. The shower scene initially appears in a kind-of washed out color, reminiscent of black and white. The Bates Motel is as moodily and ominously present in color as it was in black and white.My biggest complaint about the movie is that there was absolutely no surprise in it. Even though I enjoyed it, it seemed somewhat weird to have paid five bucks for a movie where I knew every single thing that would happen.My final verdict: I rate it a 7 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somehow have the feeling that many of the people commenting on this film are neither filmmakers nor artists, nor have any particular reverence for either. If so, they wouldn't be so sanguine about the notion of remaking a classic. Many critics ask, "Is Psycho so sacrosanct that it can't be remade?" My response would be 'yes.' Some things achieve a sort of definitiveness by their very uniqueness and excellence. They define themselves in such a way that nobody else could possibly copy it. That's my view, anyway. I take it there are a lot of people who don't share this sentiment. If some successful novelist were to take the text of The Great Gatsby, change a few words, add some sex scenes, and proclaim it a "new" novel there would be those who would hail the author for his sheer nerve and novelty. Likewise, if Hanson were to re-record Abbey Road using the same exact backing tracks, merely substituting their voices for those of the Beatles, there would be plenty who would rush out, buy it and cherish every second. I could go on and on like this. The point is, some people take creation as a very serious, soul-fulfilling, even religous, experience, whereas others see it as wallpaper. Or to put it another way, screw the artist, I like what I consume.One more thought. Do you suppose Van Sant would be completely untroubled if someone made a shot-for-shot replica of Drugstore Cowboy? How about Good Will Hunting with Leonardo diCaprio? Now there's an idea for a successful remake.</fullReview>

Gus Van Sant has taken his favorite film, dusted it off, polished it up and made it new again. Yes, it's the same screenplay, the same score and even some of the same locations, but it never tries to outdo the original or replace it.I saw the remake at a matinee show and then rented the original.Both stand alone. Heche, for instance, gives us a colder, more calculating Marion Craine, whereas Janet Leigh played the sneaky siren more like a doe trapped in oncoming headlights. And Vaughn's Norman is creepier, more childlike, laughing almost maniacally at his own lame jokes while stuffing his face with candy. Perkins's Norman was ovbiously mad from the first second he stepped into his first scene. With Vaughn, you can understand why Marion Craine would have trusted him--he had his "sane" act down.Hitchcock's Psycho and Van Sant's Psycho are more like brothers than rivals. Anyone going to the theater to prove the remake never should have been made should save him/herself the indigestion and stay home.</fullReview>

Anne Heche is also really believable and good.However, there were some really stupid things added, like Julianne Moore saying, "Just let me get my Walkman." Somehow I must have missed that line in the original version. I got the feeling that Gus Van Sant couldn't quite decide what to update to 1998 and what to leave as completely original. The office where Anne Heche/Janet Leigh worked was identical, including only having air conditioning in the boss' inner office, but then there are dumb little things like that Walkman line. Definitely worth seeing though!! I give both thumbs up (I have two after all).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a film student, and I consider myself reasonably enlightened. However, all of this B.S. about Van Sant's remake of "Psycho" is driving me nuts. So he remade it. Branagh and Gibson have both remade "Hamlet" within a span of little more than a decade! "West Side Story," by God, was (GASP) "Romeo and Juilet???" BLASPHEMY! Okay. Folks, get over it, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting Dilemma...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from seeing Pyscho and am having a hard time judging the movie... I thought that it was well done and well acted-however, when compared to the original, it is merely a replica. So I ask you this... (and this is an extreme example but it gets to the point) If I were to take J.D. Salinger's A Catcher in the Rye, use the text and rewrite it word for word how is that different from what Gus Van Sant has done with Hitchcock's classic...??? Gus Van Sant shot Pyscho using the exact same shots as Hitchcock and even used the DVD version of Pyscho as his storyboard.... Is this plagiarism...?? What is this and who deserves the credit? Hitchcock or Gus Van Sant??? To make matters possibly worse, Gus Van Sant did not acknowledge Hitchcock during the credits.... Perhaps that heightens the question of plagiarism.... What do you think??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, first of all those who are die hard fans of the original Psycho should like this (although I have the feeling they won't). The same screenwriter was used and he added parts Hitchcock wanted in the original, but the censors would not allow. That is one reason this movie worked for me...knowing Hitchcock was still behind it in some way.I thought Janet Leigh was pretty awful in the original. I just don't see why anyone except Anthony Perkins deserved recognition in the original. The acting was pretty bland and the end scene involving the analysis of Norman was excessively long. In Gus Van Sant's version, the shower scene is quicker, Norman Bates gets to perform an act he should have performed in the first film while watching Anne Heche's character through the wall, the analysis is more interesting and the acting is wonderful. The fact that the movie is the same, but has more graphic elements (such as showing the stab wounds in Anne Heche's back and the slashes on William H Macy's face) made it still interesting to me. I wasn't expecting to see the graphic elements, so I was very much interested in the movie.The only part I take issue with is the fact that Van Sant kept some elements the same that should have been changed. For instance, Anne's wardrobe is the same...it looks weird with her modern haircut. Plus, Julianne Moore is modern...why the difference in the characters? Other than these small flaws I think the movie deserves to be seen. I highly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good news. The new version of "Psycho" barely changed a thing.The bad news is that Vince Vaughn acts like too much of a nut-case, so those of you who haven't seen the original will guess the ending. That aside, this is an astonoshingly well directed film. I know it is a shot for shot remake, but that's not as easy as one might expect. For most of the film, he recreates each scene so vividly, that if this was in black and white you may confuse it with the original. Overall, this stands as a tribute to Hitchcock's original work, showing no one could do it better than the master. Van Sant's camera work is better, obviously due to today's superior equipment, and one scene has been deleted that dragged. The color film adds texture to scenes in Norman Bates' parlor that had been lost in the drabness of the black and white. One other note, William H. Macy gives the film's best performance, while Heche and Vaughn seem a little forced. Robert Forester is also good in his role. Not a complete success, but believe me, no one could remake it better. A nice surprise.</fullReview>

I love the first version of this movie with a passion and after seeing this mess, I felt like yelling out loud. Vince Vaughn and Anne Hecht have none of the chemistry Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh had. They seemed too busy trying to rip off the original actors to do anything new and fresh. (By the way, Vince, Tony Perkins will always be the ultimate Norman Bates---end of discussion.) Also, the much touted shot-for-shot, word-for-word "recreation" angle wasn't even true. (Didn't anyone else notice the church scene with Sam Loomis, Lila Crane, and Sheriff Chambers was missing?) I would give Vince a D for effort; Anne Hecht an F for the obvious rip-off of Janet Leigh; Viggo Mortensen a C for trying futilely to capture the essence of John Gavin's role; William H. Macy a B, he was the best in the movie; and Julianne Moore a C because half the time she did nothing but stand around trying to fuss like Vera Miles and, at the same time, look pretty. Sorry, Mister Van Sant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I've finally seen the new PSYCHO, I feel the critics who demanded to know "Why?" are clearly vindicated. Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot "replica" of the seminal 1960 thriller must contend with a major Hitch: This gimmick is like watching a skeleton of the original. Surely it retains some impact--but that's residue left over from Hitchcock's work, not Van Sant's. (The cinematography and editing are no less effective for having been swiped by Van Sant.)Of course this remake does not damage the original film. Since no one can deprive us of it, Hitchcock's version will always stand as a great film, regardless of the numerous sequels and remakes. Defenders rightly point out that Shakespeare is frequently adapted again and again, and painters are often praised for imitating the masters. Yet, why pay for an imitation Monet when an original is freely available at no additional cost? Van Sant's particular experiment, while no doubt exciting and enjoyable for the cast and crew, offers very little for paying audiences. The actors are well-cast and submit acceptable work, but they are nevertheless hopelessly constricted by Van Sant's decision to "replicate" rather than "reinvent." (At no point can they make these characters their "own.")This PSYCHO is not a new interpretation nor an invigorating update. It is a superficial gloss, and a meaningless cinematic exercise of filmmakers playing dress-up. Viewing it is like looking at an X-ray rather than an actual human, and just as impersonal.Eric Beltmann</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1998 version of Psycho is a movie that I went to knowing that I would not like the results. I thought that some movies are best left alone. This is particularly true of those movies that are acknowledged masterpieces, or classics. Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" qualifies on both counts and while the updated 1998 version is not remotely in the same league, I did enjoy this movie. Gus Van Sant gets an "A" for effort. I think the director takes a huge risk by not screwing with the original movie. After the credits (faithful even here to the original) we are told that the year is 1998. There are other indications of this being a later time and day -- e.g. later model cars with electric car windows. Other than this however, Gus Van Sant has tried faithfully to make us believe that we are in the middle of the 1960s. The duality of this has an interesting although not totally successful effect on the viewer. But that's okay. As far as remakes go, this one fulfills the meaning of the word better than any other "remake" I've seen. And like I say, I think it is a bold, and courageous effort for a director in Hollywood these days -- how do you make it play like 1960 in 1998. How do you make it just as scary in this day and age of Scream and Scream 2? Gus Van Sant succeeds by showing us that it didn't need updating -- it needed remembering. The shower scene is just as scary, probably more so, due to the reality of technicolor, and so are select other scenes -- all done as they were originally done by the master himself. This is a moving tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and his unique voice as a film-maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think Vince Vaughn could pick a worse movie to be in after "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." I was wrong. He's not a bad actor, but he's definitely NOT Norman Bates! The cast of actors and actresses were superb, but they were absolutely terrible in this film. Not for lack of trying, though.I can't imagine what Gus Van Sant was thinking when he made this remake. It wasn't necessarily a bad idea, but his execution of it was all wrong! His attempts to "modernize" it were shameful and crude. Did Hitchcock ever film Norman masturbating at the peephole? Did Hitchcock ever show us Lila Crane going to get her Walkman?! Plus, the shower scene and Arbogast's death were two of the most suspenseful scenes in the original, but what was with those intercut images in this remake?! They were pointless and fatal to the shock that the scenes were meant to have.What really disgusts me is how many times I've heard the director and cast proclaim how Hitchcock himself would've be flattered at their endeavor. No, I think he'd be the first one to get out of his seat and demand a refund! Hitchcock would have been disgusted by this defamation of "Psycho."In short, the only chilling thing in this film that was also true to the original was Bernard Herrmann's unnerving score. At least Danny Elfman deserves credit for preserving the music.And one last thing---"Psycho" in color? Not such a good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't have thought Gus Van Sant's filmography would indicate he'd be the one who could successfully do an adaptation of Psycho, but I found that his version works very well in spite of itself. The puritans are welcome to sneer at it, but I was very impressed with almost every aspect of this movie. The movie doesn't feel like a retread. It's still terrifically shot and edited and transcends the limitations that come from being based on as entrenched a pop culture icon as the original movie.I had some reservations early on, as it's very difficult not to hear the original actors speaking the lines, but with the help of Anne Heche, who successfully reinvents the role of Marion Crane and makes it hers, the story is allowed to be the driving influence, and it's very difficult to go wrong with a script as well-written and tightly constructed as Psycho's. When the inevitable shower scene comes, it is, and I know there are many who would disagree with me, as intense if not more so than in the original; furthermore, it comes across not as a "scene," or as a recreation of a scene, but as what it should be: a very gruesome murder of a sympathetic character. The sound effects are highly disturbing, the editing excellent. If this film can make perhaps the most deconstructed and dissected scenes in film history seem fresh, I'm willing to acknowledge that it is fine work in and of itself.Of the actors, Julianne Moore is not allowed very much time to develop her character; she arrives on one note and keeps it for her entire part of the movie, which disappointed me, given her previous performances. Viggo Mortensen overdoes the cowboy part, but is generally inoffensive, and certainly makes more impact than John Gavin in the original. Vince Vaughan should be entirely wrong for Norman Bates, but he pulls it off, adding a somewhat sleazy edge to complement the nervous tics.In the long run I was won over. It's somewhat like a house that gets a new coat of paint in colors that look weird at first glance, but eventually work if given a chance.

		<fullReview>Well, I must admit that Mr. Van Sant didn't self-destroy. His "reprise" of "Psycho" is a noble experiment, though the sound effects he added (i.e. masturbation, etc.) were not really necessary. That is really what sets Hitchcock apart from him, that he would never stoop to such cheap tricks;especially because from then on the audience couldn't help but laugh at everything Norman Bates (Vaughn) did. Instead of empathy,fear or even contempt, the audience found him funny...not at all what Perkins' performance does. However, Vince Vaughn's charisma on screen is amazing. He has star potential written all over his face (and awesome body!). The other performers were just as effective, and Van Sant's direction although mostly faithful, did leave some of his personal imprint. His addition of the birds inside the fruit cellar was wonderful,as was Julianne Moore's shows of strength and self-confidence; but the addition of the spider on Ms. Bates' face was stretching it...even cheap as were the addition of Van Sant trademarks (images of clouds, etc.)in completely unnecessary parts (It's as if Mr. Van Sant is yelling out "look, look! I still have my clouds in! Not to mention the sadomasochistic imagery! I am still original, folks!") . As a whole, the thing that impressed me the most was not the film itself, but the audience's reaction. They constantly screamed during the classic scenes, which leads me to believe that 99% of this audience had not even seen clips from the original. Maybe that was Mr. Van Sant's intention to begin with; maybe he wanted to bring Hitchcock's style to an audience that would otherwise never see it. Too bad some might say, I say--oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I must admit that Mr. Van Sant didn't self-destroy. His "reprise" of "Psycho" is a noble experiment, though the sound effects he added (i.e. masturbation, etc.) were not really necessary. That is really what sets Hitchcock apart from him, that he would never stoop to such cheap tricks;especially because from then on the audience couldn't help but laugh at everything Norman Bates (Vaughn) did. Instead of empathy,fear or even contempt, the audience found him funny...not at all what Perkins' performance does. However, Vince Vaughn's charisma on screen is amazing. He has star potential written all over his face (and awesome body!). The other performers were just as effective, and Van Sant's direction although mostly faithful, did leave some of his personal imprint. His addition of the birds inside the fruit cellar was wonderful,as was Julianne Moore's shows of strength and self-confidence; but the addition of the spider on Ms. Bates' face was stretching it...even cheap as were the addition of Van Sant trademarks (images of clouds, etc.)in completely unnecessary parts (It's as if Mr. Van Sant is yelling out "look, look! I still have my clouds in! Not to mention the sadomasochistic imagery! I am still original, folks!") . As a whole, the thing that impressed me the most was not the film itself, but the audience's reaction. They constantly screamed during the classic scenes, which leads me to believe that 99% of this audience had not even seen clips from the original. Maybe that was Mr. Van Sant's intention to begin with; maybe he wanted to bring Hitchcock's style to an audience that would otherwise never see it. Too bad some might say, I say--oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, first of all those who are die hard fans of the original Psycho should like this (although I have the feeling they won't). The same screenwriter was used and he added parts Hitchcock wanted in the original, but the censors would not allow. That is one reason this movie worked for me...knowing Hitchcock was still behind it in some way.I thought Janet Leigh was pretty awful in the original. I just don't see why anyone except Anthony Perkins deserved recognition in the original. The acting was pretty bland and the end scene involving the analysis of Norman was excessively long. In Gus Van Sant's version, the shower scene is quicker, Norman Bates gets to perform an act he should have performed in the first film while watching Anne Heche's character through the wall, the analysis is more interesting and the acting is wonderful. The fact that the movie is the same, but has more graphic elements (such as showing the stab wounds in Anne Heche's back and the slashes on William H Macy's face) made it still interesting to me. I wasn't expecting to see the graphic elements, so I was very much interested in the movie.The only part I take issue with is the fact that Van Sant kept some elements the same that should have been changed. For instance, Anne's wardrobe is the same...it looks weird with her modern haircut. Plus, Julianne Moore is modern...why the difference in the characters? Other than these small flaws I think the movie deserves to be seen. I highly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good news. The new version of "Psycho" barely changed a thing.The bad news is that Vince Vaughn acts like too much of a nut-case, so those of you who haven't seen the original will guess the ending. That aside, this is an astonoshingly well directed film. I know it is a shot for shot remake, but that's not as easy as one might expect. For most of the film, he recreates each scene so vividly, that if this was in black and white you may confuse it with the original. Overall, this stands as a tribute to Hitchcock's original work, showing no one could do it better than the master. Van Sant's camera work is better, obviously due to today's superior equipment, and one scene has been deleted that dragged. The color film adds texture to scenes in Norman Bates' parlor that had been lost in the drabness of the black and white. One other note, William H. Macy gives the film's best performance, while Heche and Vaughn seem a little forced. Robert Forester is also good in his role. Not a complete success, but believe me, no one could remake it better.

		<shortDescription>A skeleton of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've finally seen the new PSYCHO, I feel the critics who demanded to know "Why?" are clearly vindicated. Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot "replica" of the seminal 1960 thriller must contend with a major Hitch: This gimmick is like watching a skeleton of the original. Surely it retains some impact--but that's residue left over from Hitchcock's work, not Van Sant's. (The cinematography and editing are no less effective for having been swiped by Van Sant.)Of course this remake does not damage the original film. Since no one can deprive us of it, Hitchcock's version will always stand as a great film, regardless of the numerous sequels and remakes. Defenders rightly point out that Shakespeare is frequently adapted again and again, and painters are often praised for imitating the masters. Yet, why pay for an imitation Monet when an original is freely available at no additional cost? Van Sant's particular experiment, while no doubt exciting and enjoyable for the cast and crew, offers very little for paying audiences. The actors are well-cast and submit acceptable work, but they are nevertheless hopelessly constricted by Van Sant's decision to "replicate" rather than "reinvent." (At no point can they make these characters their "own.")This PSYCHO is not a new interpretation nor an invigorating update. It is a superficial gloss, and a meaningless cinematic exercise of filmmakers playing dress-up. Viewing it is like looking at an X-ray rather than an actual human, and just as impersonal.Eric Beltmann</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Tribute to the Master of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1998 version of Psycho is a movie that I went to knowing that I would not like the results. I thought that some movies are best left alone. This is particularly true of those movies that are acknowledged masterpieces, or classics. Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" qualifies on both counts and while the updated 1998 version is not remotely in the same league, I did enjoy this movie. Gus Van Sant gets an "A" for effort. I think the director takes a huge risk by not screwing with the original movie. After the credits (faithful even here to the original) we are told that the year is 1998. There are other indications of this being a later time and day -- e.g. later model cars with electric car windows. Other than this however, Gus Van Sant has tried faithfully to make us believe that we are in the middle of the 1960s. The duality of this has an interesting although not totally successful effect on the viewer. But that's okay. As far as remakes go, this one fulfills the meaning of the word better than any other "remake" I've seen. And like I say, I think it is a bold, and courageous effort for a director in Hollywood these days -- how do you make it play like 1960 in 1998. How do you make it just as scary in this day and age of Scream and Scream 2? Gus Van Sant succeeds by showing us that it didn't need updating -- it needed remembering. The shower scene is just as scary, probably more so, due to the reality of technicolor, and so are select other scenes -- all done as they were originally done by the master himself. This is a moving tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and his unique voice as a film-maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Creepy' must mean something different today. It must mean stylistic shadows and waaaay too many sinister smiles (thank-you, Vince). I think Gus forgot that the CONCEPT of Psycho is what makes it creepy, not his own indulgence of adding some disjunct editing in the shower scene.The new movie was done in color, but fails to add anything else significant. More importantly, the original was done in black &amp; white NOT because it was before the color era, but rather for EFFECT. Gus was quoted as saying that the color makes it more intense. More intense than what -- bleak, freaky monochrome imagery that was in the original? Not likely. Now that effect is lost, and Alfred can do nothing about it.Rent the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disgrace to Hitchcock's Memory and Masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think Vince Vaughn could pick a worse movie to be in after "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." I was wrong. He's not a bad actor, but he's definitely NOT Norman Bates! The cast of actors and actresses were superb, but they were absolutely terrible in this film. Not for lack of trying, though.I can't imagine what Gus Van Sant was thinking when he made this remake. It wasn't necessarily a bad idea, but his execution of it was all wrong! His attempts to "modernize" it were shameful and crude. Did Hitchcock ever film Norman masturbating at the peephole? Did Hitchcock ever show us Lila Crane going to get her Walkman?! Plus, the shower scene and Arbogast's death were two of the most suspenseful scenes in the original, but what was with those intercut images in this remake?! They were pointless and fatal to the shock that the scenes were meant to have.What really disgusts me is how many times I've heard the director and cast proclaim how Hitchcock himself would've be flattered at their endeavor. No, I think he'd be the first one to get out of his seat and demand a refund! Hitchcock would have been disgusted by this defamation of "Psycho."In short, the only chilling thing in this film that was also true to the original was Bernard Herrmann's unnerving score. At least Danny Elfman deserves credit for preserving the music.And one last thing---"Psycho" in color? Not such a good idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original despite itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't have thought Gus Van Sant's filmography would indicate he'd be the one who could successfully do an adaptation of Psycho, but I found that his version works very well in spite of itself. The puritans are welcome to sneer at it, but I was very impressed with almost every aspect of this movie. The movie doesn't feel like a retread. It's still terrifically shot and edited and transcends the limitations that come from being based on as entrenched a pop culture icon as the original movie.I had some reservations early on, as it's very difficult not to hear the original actors speaking the lines, but with the help of Anne Heche, who successfully reinvents the role of Marion Crane and makes it hers, the story is allowed to be the driving influence, and it's very difficult to go wrong with a script as well-written and tightly constructed as Psycho's. When the inevitable shower scene comes, it is, and I know there are many who would disagree with me, as intense if not more so than in the original; furthermore, it comes across not as a "scene," or as a recreation of a scene, but as what it should be: a very gruesome murder of a sympathetic character. The sound effects are highly disturbing, the editing excellent. If this film can make perhaps the most deconstructed and dissected scenes in film history seem fresh, I'm willing to acknowledge that it is fine work in and of itself.Of the actors, Julianne Moore is not allowed very much time to develop her character; she arrives on one note and keeps it for her entire part of the movie, which disappointed me, given her previous performances. Viggo Mortensen overdoes the cowboy part, but is generally inoffensive, and certainly makes more impact than John Gavin in the original. Vince Vaughan should be entirely wrong for Norman Bates, but he pulls it off, adding a somewhat sleazy edge to complement the nervous tics.In the long run I was won over. It's somewhat like a house that gets a new coat of paint in colors that look weird at first glance, but eventually work if given a chance. I'll go so far as to say it's the best new movie I've seen this year. See it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done "replica"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has been reading the previous user comments that were written before December 4th should know that chances are whoever wrote them never saw the film (not even reviewers were allowed to see it before it was released) and were just disturbed that the original may have been torn apart. However, with the same exact script and same camera angles it's basically impossible for it to be considered a horrible film.There are very, very few changes from the original so fans of the Alfred Hitchcock version should not be disappointed. Janet Leigh's performance may have not been as well done by Anne Heche but Anne still gives a realistic performance. Anthony Perkins Norman Bates character on the other hand is well overpassed, Vince Vaughn gives a stunning performance of the man. William H Macy is also seen as the private investigator although I still have trouble picturing him as Jerry Lumgardner ever since I saw Fargo. Julianne Moore and Robert Forester also make brief roles towards the end of the film and do decent work although their screen time is a little bit limited.The reason they re-did Pyscho was not to totally remake it, everyone who was behind the making of this 1998 release consider it a "replica" to honor the master of suspense. I did not have much of a problem with this film at all other than knowing what would be happening next. One of the reasons this may fail will not be from only fans of Hitchcock's saying that this is a classic that should have never been remade but more from teens who have not seen this movie and are used to more modern type of horror films like Scream. Psycho was and always will be a classic and seeing a well done replica of it doesn't hurt one bit.</fullReview>

He probably would have just re-shot the old scenes using the same script (or even worse, he may have just added things and used the old scenes). Besides, Van Sant has said that he's trying to expand on things which Hitchcock wanted to but didn't have the capabilities (due to technology, ratings etc..). At only $30 million US, this film is bound to recoup its cost a few times over worldwide, and while it can't top the original (what could top the original shock of mother?) it's going to bring a whole new audience to it.

		<fullReview>Okay, I just came from seeing Gus Van Sant's take on Hitchcock's PSYCHO and although it is slavishly faithful in form to the original, it misses by a mile in spirit. It is too brightly colored, the line readings have the wrong tone, and the additions Van Sant has made (very few) are wrong-headed. The picture has a stale anachronistic feel to it. Off to a good start with the Saul Bass credit sequence and a terrific helicopter shot over Phoenix (which is the only technical advance over the original) we become impatient with the shot-for-shot, line-by-line copy and bordeom sets in. Ann Heche has none of Janet Leigh's sadness and desperation, Vince Vaughn has none of Anthony Perkins nervous, boyish appeal, and William Macy is a bust as Arbogast. He looks like a little kid wearing his father's clothes (that hat!?) I was willing to give Van Sant and company the benefit of the doubt (see my earlier entry) but this new PSYCHO is tired, depressing and unnecessary. Too bad, because Van Sant is one of the freshest directors working today (TO DIE FOR, especially). Arbogast's line "If it doesn't jell it isn't aspic" has been changed to "If it doesn't jell it isn't Jell-o". That's the problem. The original is aspic and this new dud is just Jell-o. The only way to get this new PSYCHO out of your mind is to watch the original.</fullReview>

Van Sant, if I may postulate as to his motives, did this because the process of making it was fun, FOR HIM. To study the ways, step into the shoes of an artist he looked up to. To put on the proverbial wig. It is not intended to be better than the original, and I doubt that the end product was of great importance to anyone but the studio. Van Sant, by way of recent successes, found himself in a position to do something he had always wanted to do, for fun, and get paid for it. Good for him. Its recent appearance on our movie screens is merely a by-product; no one's asking you to praise it. Furthermore, it has no potential for harm; at worst, it's a bad movie. But it's still a DIFFERENT movie than the original. I saw it. I had a good time and I'm glad I saw it. But I still like the old one better.</fullReview>

Compare it to this: The Beatles began their careers doing covers of Chuck Berry, and today's Metallica now has an album out of completely covers. I do not think this is the pinnacle of the lack of originality, but shows that today's movie society is open to things of this nature. As for the movie itself, I believe Vince Vaughn's portrayal of Norman Bates rivals Anthony Perkins'. This movie would be just as surprising to someone who has not seen it, as the original would be.

		<fullReview>Everyone's complaining about how a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is such a horrible idea. Here's one thing everyone must give it: it is new. Never before has this been done, so I say go for it. Why not? Do we revere Psycho that much that we must put it on a pedestal high above everyone else. Van Sant is making this film as much for himself as anyone else. I'm a filmmaker, and I have to say that making this movie sounds like a lot of fun. That's probably one of Van Sant's biggest motivations. This movie is going to be a blast. It's not gonna be a work of art, it's gonna be a cool experiment. At the same time, a younger audience will be exposed to this film. Hitchcock's film IS a classic, but let's face it, if you re-release that print, nobody's gonna pay to see it. I know that this version won't be nearly be as good as the original, but I can't wait to see it, especially since I know the original so well. Here's the best analogy I can give for this remake. It's like doing a play. Shakespeare for example. Should we never do another version of Hamlet? Of course not. It's a great play. What the hell is wrong with doing a great film again? Van Sant's doing this because he can, because of his Good Will Hunting mainstream success. Good for him. Do it. It should be a blast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant, as a director, has decided to do something that no one before him has ever attempted. Instead of simply remaking a film, he has chosen to replicate a classic, shot by shot, word for word. The fact that he has chosen a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock indicates Van Sant's level of admiration for one of the masters of this medium. What director wouldn't want to get into Hitchcock's head, and take up the challenge of recreating one of his films?It's a brave, gutsy move, and it should introduce a whole new generation to (what was upon its initial release) a brave, gutsy movie.</fullReview>

Just taking the script and doing it frame by frame with just a couple of dialogue changes for the times is unimaginitive to make a few pennies. The original is a superior classic that broke a lot of ground in the industry while this remake will be nothing more as a forgotten remake which true movie buffs and fans of the original will say in the end, "This version is like the original" which the original should have been left alone!!!</fullReview>

But I also believe that an updated cast and director might give it a new edge to the new audience now who haven't seen the original and might raise the movie's popularity once again.

Tony Scott(aarghh) had been set to direct it, I wouldn't give it a secondthought. But since Gus van Sant has only turned out extremelyinteresting films so far, I'm now actually looking forward toit. I personally can't imagine how one could give Psycho a newtwist (especially since both Perkins and Leigh have becomeicons, as well as the over-exposed shower scene), but I trust vanSant's ingenuity to really surprise me. After all, he managed toturn the rather pathetic "Good Will Hunting"-script into anexciting and memorable movie. So "all we are saying, is give vanSan a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho. Nothing more can summarize this film. Some (most) feel that it stands on it's own. But, lets look at it this way. As Vince Vaughn (The new Norman Bates) says...(paraphrased) All art should be interpreted by each individual. Each person takes away something different from whatever they encounter. I think it has been long over due to remake a classic such as this film. Gus Van Sant in a bold move, grabs the reigns by the hand and plunges us deep into the world of Hitchcock's classic thriller. Yet, in a modern way...cinema-graphically, and culturally. He keeps the effect with brilliance and much tribute. Keeping close to the script, with a dash of new vision.Therefore, thanks to Gus, Vince (My Favorite Actor today), and Anne (who is brilliant.) Psycho (1998) is as effective as the original, if not more. Bravo!!</fullReview>

The casting is inspired!The big question for me is how the issue of suspense and surprise will be addressed. If we can think back to the first time we saw the original, a great part of the thrill was discovering the actual condition of Norman's mother. This device is gone, as no one in the audience is unaware of the story line. How will this new angle be addressed? Can a new avenue of suspense be created with in the same storyline?

I couldn't even finish it.The acting is stupidly bad, there's nothing new about this movie besides the fact that Marion stole more money from the salesman in this movie than the original, This remake is just the same movie, with color, with awful actors, with THE SAME SCREENPLAY as the original, and after about 25 min I just closed the movie.From the very first frame, I already knew it's gonna be bad. Even the first scene after the credits roll is THE EXACT SAME AS THE ORIGINAL but with color !!I'm so mad at this movie, this is legitimately the worst remake I ever saw. There' not a SINGLE MOMENT where you feel suspense or tension or even entertainment !! I didn't have a single moment I didn't think to myself this movie is watchable. I wanted to watch it to see if it's as bad as everyone says and what did I discover ? IT'S THAT BAD !!!This film made me angry every second. After I saw the famous shower scene been remade- I completely lost it. This is one of the most unnecessary films I've ever watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I made an IMDb account so that I could review this tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to even begin on something so blatantly insulting to any kind of a cinema lover. You don't even need to watch the original to recognize the clumsiness of the atmosphere in this film. There's a reason why Hitchcock was such an innovative director of the 50's, but that isn't to say that watching some of his stylistic choices on the modernized, colored big screen might come across as eccentric or strange. By the time the late 90's rolled around, most of the popular "Hitchcockian" moves had been utilized to a degree of irritating. Hitchcock has become a stylistic icon, but that's not to say that quite a few of his attempts didn't die with the times. This is one of the major flaws in this BUTCHER of a film. For example, the translation of the face-front murder of Milton takes you just a bit out of the original, but rips your sides open in the context of the remake. What we might see as a previous mistake is now a glaring sore staring at you with big, stupid blue eyes.This brings me to the matter of the casting choice. Janet Leigh's wide-eyed portrayal of Marion is just innocent enough to be charming, rigid enough to be untrustworthy, and sweet enough to be pitied. Anne Heche is just... weird. I'm not one to focus on looks, but one of the major appeals to Marion is her appearance. She's absolutely beautiful and it's understandable why Norman would grow so possessive and obsessive over her after a mere few hours of conversation. Heche, though the lines are exactly the same and the directing is a horrendous copy, is an uncomfortable choice with a look that's just far too rough to make you want to protect her. Marion looks like a "heroin chic" and this contradicts the feel of the entire character. Already we're off to a bad start and with the unnatural scene-for-scene remakes, and it's just so obvious that this girl is not our modern Marion regardless of whether her acting is acceptable or not. As bad as Marion is, Norman is worse. Oh, so much worse. Vince Vaughn is already (particularly in the late 90's to early 2000's) kind of odd to see in anything other than comedy. Not saying that he doesn't have the chops to pull of different genres, but when he doesn't work he just doesn't work. This film is the prime example of how sometimes an actor just can't lose their name in a role, no matter how hard they try. Anthony Perkins was both physical and talent-wise a genius choice in casting. No one could have embodied the role as perfectly as he, and this is owed in part due to his gangling appearance and uncomfortable delivery. He'd never played a threatening character like this before and he'd never been taken seriously as anything other than an intelligent romantic interest or lead. HE KILLS (ha.ha.ha.) IT AS NORMAN BATES. Vince Vaughn looks like an aged frat boy. He's too used to playing likable to be awkward and not the last person you'd suspect to be a psychotic killer, which is the whole surprise and wonder of the character. You aren't rooting for him like you were with Perkins. Vaughn is obviously trying to be cute and it's so weird and so awkward in the way it's not supposed to be. The point of Norman Bates is to either trust him or crush on him, and you just do not fall for this with Vaughn. You just kind of want him to stop giggling and stuttering.This brings me to the Magnum Opus of the sins in this film: WHAT KIND OF A PERSON WOULD WATCH PSYCHO AND THINK "u know what this scene would be better with Norman intensely rubbing one out"? That addition alone (and trust me, it's one of the only changes to the original in the whole freaking movie) alters the feel of the entire relationship between Norman and Marion! You're supposed to LIKE Norman, even as he's peeping through a wall! This scene is intended to reinforce the idea that this guy is quite a bit unhinged. Gus Van Sant destroyed the likability of one of cinema's most likable villains by turning him from a sexually confused and restrained child into a horny man who frequents in jerking it to the women he brings to the motel. Norman goes from trying to understand and fight his mother's internal screeching to a total creep with no self restraint. Bam, the relationship between Marion and Norman now has this underlying sexual tone and feels so insincere when it's supposed to be far more innocent and personal.Thinking back upon this movie, nearly every decision seems, to me, an outlandish mistake. I like Julianne Moore, but no way no how is she related to Anne Heche. Viggo Mortensen lacks the elegant masculinity of John Gavin and the tension of strong versus small, commanding versus nervous is lost between Sam and Norman. The only choice I found palatable was William H. Macy as as Milton Arbogast and even then it's nothing to scream about. Macy is about as pleasant and fitting in the role as Balsam, but the stair/stabbing scene is still going to have you wincing through the colors.Only remake a movie when: you can modernize the script enough to keep it from feeling outlandish, bring something original to the plot and something new for the audience to think about, and sustain the feel of the source material. Despite the fact that this was a word for word plagiarism of Psycho, this film managed to miss every requirement I have for remakes, and with this being one of my ultimate favorites, nothing hurts more. Stick to heartfelt originals Sant, because this is not your fort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I first heard that they were remaking "Psycho", I thought it was one of the stupidest things I had heard. How do you improve on something that is a classic. Then I heard it was going to be a scene to scene remake, and that sounded even stupider. Naturally, I avoided the movie when it was released to theaters and video. But something in the back of my mind made me curious. So when the other night it played on TV, I thought I would give it a look.Yes, the movie is pretty bad. There are many things wrong with it, like Vince Vaughn's forced performance and the fact it feels very slow despite having the same running time as the original film. But I think the biggest problem with the movie is that it's an awkward mix of two radically different styles. On one hand, the movie has elements that are straight from the 1960 version. On the other hand, the movie also has elements from 1998. The two styles don't mix well at all, and the movie feels very strange and unnatural.If they really wanted to remake the original movie, they should have taken the basic premise and done their own thing with it in a more modern style. Yes, it probably would still have been bad, but it would have had some originality as well as being executed in one basic style - all of which would have made it more bearable than how this remake is now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often deemed as the worst remake of all time, it's hard not to agree because it's a frame by frame shot of the Hitchcock's Psycho movie. I can't get past the fact that there's nothing new original and at points I was asking myself why I was even watching this drivel. There was really no good performances by all the high profile actors and actresses since they were trying too hard to mimic the original characters. I would have had much more respect if the director tried to taking it a different way, especially with the great case and high budget. It then would have had the potential to be refreshing and unique and been somewhat separated. It's unrealistic thinking though since Hitchcock's masterpiece would trump anything that the director and writers would put out. I'm giving it (2/10), simply because it was kind of cool to see Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates but there isn't a positive thing to like about the filmmaking. Not worth anyone's time, what a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho is for the most part a duplicate of the Hitchcock original yet it's received mostly negative reviews. How can that be? Well, the original Psycho was quite ground-breaking at the time of it's release. It depicted sex and violence in a rather frank manner. The shower scene was infamous. Nearly 40 years later the material Van Sant revisits has no cultural impact. It's very good but it's not great. It's a bit like watching Joel Grey as the master of ceremonies in a performance of Caberet then watching Neil Patrick Parris in the role decades later. No matter how good Harris is Joel Grey will always be better. Even IF you've never seen Grey in the role, you know he's better because people have told you he's better. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho will always be better than Gus Van Sant's Psycho. Van Sant's Psycho took a beating in the press and much of that was prejudice. And there were those who were vocal about their contempt at the idea of a remake of something so revered and important. Screw the bad press. Psycho is a wonderful film. Just as I remembered it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho as Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some consider remakes to be the most unnecessary of film projects. Very rarely does a new version of an old favorite result in an improvement on it. An exception, it seemed, was the 1991 version of Cape Fear, which the world at large considered an improvement on the 1962 original. I actually thought it was one of the most ridiculous films I'd ever seen, but there you go.Maybe it was the widely held view of that film that prompted Gus Van Sant to come up with his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960). Actually, it's not so much a remake as pretty well a carbon copy with color painted on. Each scene is reproduced and even the music is the same.As for the performances, well, there is little to say. None of the performers, and there are some good ones here, really comes off well. The most obvious example is Vince Vaughn, who does not seem so much to be acting the part of Norman Bates as to be imitating Anthony Perkins acting the part of Norman Bates. Anne Heche is even worse as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, and the rest are not much better.Why did they bother then? To make money, I suppose. The film is otherwise interesting only as a curiosity, designed to prove, if you like, that some films were only ever meant to be made once.Rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

We should judge every movie based upon its own merits. Do we ask every other movie to be this good? No, of course we don't. So there's no point in making that comparison here. So what is '98's Psycho then? It's a very thorough tribute to the original by a director and cast who clearly respect the original as much as I do. That and its precision to detail gets it 6 stars right there. The 7th star goes entirely to the performance of Vince Vaughn. He plays the same character in every other movie I've ever seen him in... Vince Vaughn. But after seeing this, I'll give him credit from now on. He really is an actor, not just a comedian who does the same character in every movie he's ever in.</fullReview>

As a film buff, since I was a child I have always wondered, "What if (insert title here) was filmed today?" I'd bet that we all have. This film needed to be made, to answer that question. Not only does it answer a lot of questions about film making but it took a lot of balls to make it. Having sad that, it doesn't need to be done again. All of the performances are top notch but it is hard to see that because of the nature of the film. The cinematography is great. The music is great (it always was! Lol). This film should be respected and seen the way it was meant to be seen. We understand that because of the smart sense of humour of Mr Van Sant. In the original film we see Mr Hitchcock outside Marion's office. In this film we see him still but lecturing, directing Mr Van Sant. Brilliant. This film is an exception and I respect the film makers for making it. I give it an 8 out of 10 but a 10 out of 10 for guts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a shot on shot remake of the 1960 classic "Psycho" which has exactly the same storyline as the original but none of it's charm.Why oh why was this made, this has to be the worst horror remake I've ever seen, Gus Van Sant should have left this movie well and truly alone, this was one movie that didn't need to be remade, I mean how in the hell did the film industry let this self indulgent tripe ever seen the light of day, it's just totally unnecessary what a total waste of money. I bet Alfred Hitchcock is turning in his grave, seeing how his greatest masterpiece cheapened into a rubbish Hollywood remake. Okay it would be hard for any director to try and remake a Hitchcock classic, but this one just had absolutely no effort put into it what's so ever, this has absolutely none of the charm the first one had and I hope to god that Hollywood won't ever try re-booting this franchise again, apart from part II, this franchise just tumbled further and further downhill and this awful remake was and still is the final nail in the coffin. This was actually the 2nd Psycho movie I'd seen at the time, just before this one came out, I watched the original first and then I watched this one with good intentions, at the time I was actually interested in seeing a different version of the original with a different set of actors taking on the roles, but when I finally saw this I was solely disappointed.Right all the bad points of this movie, firstly the new Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins brought vulnerability to his portrayal of Norman Bates he looked like any other normal guy before showing his true menacing colours at the end. In this one we get Vince Vaughn, I actually like him as an actor I think he's great I love his work normally apart from this, He's just no Anthony Perkins in this he actually looked like a deranged pervert hence bringing no surprise to the twist ending, and what was with that stupid masturbating scene, I mean come on!, like I said I actually like the guy but just not in this, I bet he probably regrets making this tripe but at least he tried to do something different with Norman Bates although it didn't work I still applaud him. More bad points like the killer mother's outfit, what was with that stupid pink dressing gown, pink fluffy slippers and scruffy blonde hair, at least in the original she looked menacing, in this one she looked like trailer trash, not even the least bit menacing And what was with this stupid random shots of things when the murders occur like showing lightening and silent movies, what was the friggin point of them, I just didn't get it and the murder scenes, I mean why did they have to copy them exactly like the original, they should have something different with them in this version they just looked like carbon copy's of the first one, rather lame in my opinion. He totally altered the PSYCHO house which didn't look half as creepy as the one in the original. Gus Van Sant tried to improve on the final confrontation. Big mistake! It was totally botched due to the area being too vast, therefore lessening the tension of the original's claustrophobic setting and what was with that bird sanctuary. And he shot the film in colour which failed to echo the dread-filled B&amp;W aura of the original. It was too damn bright in here and that took away from the impact of the tale! and lastly Anne Heche's portrayal of Marion Crane was nothing compared to the great Janet Leigh, she had none of the charisma of what Janet Leigh had, no wonder Anne Heche's career went down the crapper after this.All in all this Psycho remake was the final nail in the coffin of a franchise that started off so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film about a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>pretty much every comment says that this remake was pointless but i think they're not getting the point of this remake. Gus Van Sant made an homage to Hitchcock. He deliberately copied camera movements and script. You cant look at this film as a stand alone, but you must look at it with the original Psycho. This version is a meta-film, its a film about a film. Its a critique in a way on the original psycho, except instead of writing an article about it Gus Van Sant decided to make a film instead. You should see both films back to back, the original first and then Van Sant's remake, its quite interesting to watch. Of course i have my own issues with the remake. I don't think the cast was the best choice for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gus Van Sant's Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying this: Van Sant's remake of 'Psycho' is not a terrible movie. That is quite impossible as it is so closely related to the original. However, because it is nearly shot by shot of the original, you can't help comparing the two in every single aspect of presentation. And when you do that, this version suffers horrifically. The original Psycho is, it's a fact, it's there, we've seen it. Why do a remake unless you're going to make it your own. There's no point in doing a shot by shot. But, don't think that this movie is only unworthy when compared to the original, if I were truly comparing the two, my score for this film would be 1 star. On its own, however, I'd give it 2 1/2. Now let's start the critique: The movie is in color, which is a bad choice. I'm not merely saying this because the original is in black and white, even though when compared, there's no question that black and white is just better. The Motel looks like any other Motel, especially with the bright red neon lights. And the house, a sort of pukish reddish orange, is equally comical. There's no sense of ominousity that there would have been if they'd done it in black and white. Now the cinematography is the same in the original, so I must compare the two. The cinematography in the original was designed for a black and white movie, all the camera shots and lighting were specifically created to puncuate the photography, therefore, using the same cinematography doesn't quite work for this version because it's in color. The lighting isn't ominous, the camera angles aren't eccentuating what the film has to offer. Now, the music is the same way, pulled directly from the original film. But, the original film was in black and white, and Bernard Hermann chose to use all strings because of that. The music doesn't quite work when the film is brought to color. They should have reorchestrated the music to include brass and percussion. Now, let's focus on the actors for a minute: Anne Heche does a fine job as Marion. At times she overdoes it, but on the whole, it's a fine performance. And the only one. Vince Vaughn attempts the impossible at trying to play Norman Bates, granted it's not entirely his fault he can't get it right, but a lot of times it is. Even if you're acting a part that is immortal, you can still make it believable. Vaughn puts on his acting face and I never quite believed anything he was doing. I was excited at first seeing Julianne Moore, but she rushes through her dialogue that she becomes just as unconvincing as Vaughn. William H. Macy was a misfire, as was Viggo Mortensen. The weird thing about this 'Psycho' is where the humor is concerned. Macy and Vaughn don't seem like they're having any fun at all in their scene together, which should be the funniest scene in the film. However, Moore seems to be having the time of her life when she's being attacked by Vaughn, putting all her feminist hilarity into kicking him in the face. Overall, all of the performances, including the horrible voice over of 'Mother' were a complete misfire. Now, the shower scene is an immortal scene from the original. If your going to do a mostly shot by shot remake, why would you not keep intact the integrity of the shower scene? There is a big pause after Mother opens the curtain where Marion takes time to process that there's someone there before any music or stabbing or screaming happens. Very awkward. And then, three immortal shots are left out or changed: The shot of Marion's hand sliding down the wall is completely left out. The shot of Marion falling to the floor is changed so that we can have a buttshot, and the tilt of the camera zooming away from the eye is replaced with a massive twirling of the camera around the eye. Not dramatic at all. Now, after all that, there were a few things I enjoyed: Viggo Mortensen's nude scene. I only wished it showed more. And the birds in the cellar. Oh, and I'd like to say that Rita Wilson gives the worst performance of her career. That said, it is fun to compare the two films and to bash on the completely nonscary elements in this version. Go and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Psycho paradox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting paradox: how can a movie be almost the carbon copy of a masterpiece and yet suck? Several posters have already written excellent reviews about the absurdity of a shot-for-shot remake of Hitchcock's classic, so I'll just focus on two problems: casting and colors.1) This film is a perfect example of how choosing capable actors does not necessarily equate to good casting.I feel almost bad for attacking Vaughn, because he was faced with a terrible task - reinterpreting one of the most iconic performances in movie history. And yet, it has to be said: the comparison with Perkins leaves him in the dust. Perkins' turn as Norman is legend - look at the astonishing range of his performance: he starts as a shy, likable young man; only for brief moments he shows glimpses of something creepy, but indecipherable (the "put her in someplace" bit); then we have his chilling final scenes, his unforgettable grin.Vaughn's Norman is a banal killer. Unlike Perkins, he looks threatening from the start, with cheapens the final revelation - you understand at once he is not to be trusted, and never sympathize with him. Heche is a stiff, glacial Marion; even the great Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore do not shine.William H. Macy, an excellent actor, is miscast as a tough private eye. Martin Balsam's Arbogast was cool, sardonic, competent, you believe he knew his stuff and so his abrupt demise was all the more shocking. When Macy's detective bites the dust, you can almost hear poor Jerry Lundegaard from Fargo babbling: "The heck do ya mean?" 2) This remake jettisons black and white cinematography and goes for a maelstrom of lurid colors which give the movie a grotesque look ("Fear and Loathing in the Bates Motel"). The result is NOWHERE as stylish as the original. If you have ever wondered how black and white classics (say, The Third Man or The Night of the Hunter) would appear in color, look on this remake and despair.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake Psycho? Here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why?" is the first thought that comes to mind. Gus Van Sant has answered with saying that he wishes to expose one of his favorite films to modern viewers. "It was like staging a contemporary production of a classic play while remaining true to the original." I think that is where the problem comes in. Every scene was re-done exactly, movement by movement, shot by shot. The only real differences were the color and the cast.First of all - the color. It was interesting to see it, but as you watch the film you realize why Hitchcock chose for it to be in black and white. It takes away from the dark atmosphere and is cheapened.Almost everyone in the film was irrevocably miscast. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? William H. Macy as Arbogast? It was painful to see Vaughn attempt the exceptional performance of Anthony Perkins. He tries, but fails miserably to capture Norman's psyche. Most notably at conclusion - all the great quality is lost. Anne Heche is disappointing, she gains no sympathy from the audience as Marion Crane, which made the shower scene in the original so horrifying.The only upside to this film is the score. Danny Elfman does a wonderful job updating Bernard Herrmann's wonderful music. It's fresh and clear. *** This comment may contain spoilers ***Van Sant also went through with Hitchcock's visions that he was unable to do because of censorship or technical difficulties. For example, the opening panning shot of the buildings in Phoenix. When the camera goes into the window were Marion and Sam are, it went straight through, which was Hitchcock's original intention. During the shower scene, Marion's bottom is in view when she falls over the tub. It was deleted due to censorship, but Hitchcock felt it was unnecessary anyway.*** End of spoilers ***It is not that they decided to re-make a classic that bothers me, but how they did it. Pat Hitchcock (Hitch's daughter) said that her father would have been humbled by someone wanting to re-do his film, and naturally. However, it would have been more intriguing to see this film actually updated to modern times - not re-done exactly which a few changes. The way I look at Psycho (98) is that it is best example to show how not to re-make a film. Re-makes should become the director's own, not specifically shot exactly like the original's. I got a chuckle out of Lila Crane saying "Let me get my Walkman first." You can't watch this without remembering how Hitchcock's was perfection. Even people who know nothing of it's inspiration will be uninterested with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless exercise in film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant really should have known better than to take on this project. The idea of producing a modern, colour remake of "Psycho" was always going to be doomed to failure. "Psycho" is a product of its time and its black and white state adds to its atmosphere and sense of unease. Filming the remake in colour removes half the tension to begin with.How do you make a "Psycho" movie without Anthony Perkins? The late actor was so memorable as Norman Bates that it's foolhardy to try to recast the role. It's an uncomfortable experience watching the otherwise talented Vince Vaughn trying to fill Perkins' shoes.Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen and William H. Macy all deliver credible performances but they're restrained by the concept of this remake.5 out of 10. Where Van Sant deviates from the original blueprint there are moments of originality. Otherwise, a genuine waste of talent and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why even try to follow up an Alfred Hitchcock classic such as Psycho? I grew up on color television and special effects yet I thought the 1960 Psycho was great... not so much the 1998 Psycho. Firstly, Vince Vaughn was not the right person to play Norman Bates. Using Vaughn is almost as bad as casting Bobcat Goldthwait as Jack in "Titanic." Vince Vaughn is a COMEDIAN!! He just didn't convince me that he was psycho... Nutty yeah, but not psycho. Secondly, the atmosphere was not that of a scary movie, nor was it true to the original. It was much to bright, sunny and non-threatening. Finally, this movie just failed to move me one way or another.</fullReview>

Then during my Junior year of high school I was able to watch the original and I though the original was made of pure awesome. When I got the see the ending of this film, I said to my self, somethings were made better, but some things just missed all together.For example one part that I was was better was the Norman room scene. I liked how it was in the original movie, but I liked the version in the remake much better, it seemed to give more a teenager, then a 10 year old boy.The color scheme was a huge miss in my opinion. The original could have been made in color, but the black and white film is what made it good. The color was too bright in the remake, and didn't make it as scary as it could have been, and should have had a darken tone to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's adaptation of Psycho is a good one. In fact, it's near perfect. But therein lies the problem with the whole. Van Sant takes a classic, still revered by today's generations, and dips it in color, changes a few lines of dialogue, and props it up for all to see. He takes no risks, executing things exactly shot-for-shot, and making this the one thing all movies aspire not to be, good or bad: disposable. Why see this when you can see the original in all its groundbreaking glory? It is somewhat fascinating to see the modern day ensemble act out the infamous parts, including Vince Vaughn's ambitious but overshot performance as Norman Bates, Anthony Perkin's iconic character. The violence is bloodier, the film colorful and vibrant, but what is added that makes this more important then the original? Not a thing. The dialogue is taken word-for-word, the shots look exactly the same. Even actions and reactions remain intact. One has to wonder if Van Sant even did any work at all, or just took the storyboards and script from the original. It pains me deeply to see a project that could have been great become something unnecessary: a re-telling instead of a re-imagining. Van Sant himself claimed he made the film so that "no one else would". If you're not going to do it right, don't do it at all, but again, there is the problem. Van Sant did it right, and that, unfortunately, was the wrong thing to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a feeling when Gus Van Sant's version of "Psycho" was released that it would go down in flames.Not saying that Van Sant is a lousy director (See "Good Will Hunting," "To Die For" and "My Private Idaho."), but even the best directors can make the occasional mistake.Marion Crane (Anne Heche)flees town after stealing $400,000 (Higher than the amount in the original film)so she can have a happy existence with her boyfriend Sam (Viggo Mortensen). During a stormy night, she stumbles upon the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), who seems to have an issue with his mother.A shower scene later, Marion is no more. Her sister Lila (Julianne Moore)comes to town seeking her sister. Arbogast, a private detective (William H. Macy)is also on the hunt for Marion. And of course, all the answers to the questions they seek is at the Bates Motel.What brings the film down is that it was really unnecessary to remake it. Also, there are things in the film that are just out of place (What's with the imagery? And what's up with Norman "pleasuring himself?"). It was a noble effort to do this film, but whenever you monkey with a classic, it smacks of sacrilege.If you must watch this, then my suggestion is to watch this and the original and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the psycho remake is a movie about the new era of film-making vs. the old. the script for psycho was written in the late 50s, and seeing modern actors speak the words of a 50s script, as this movie shows, is truly bizarre and shows how "old-fashioned" and different the writing of the earlier scripts were. the performances also underscore the differences. the acting styles of early Hollywood were generally rather "wooden" (e.g. think Joseph Cotten, "dragnet", etc.), but the modern actors - anne heche in particular, who is terrific - deliver ultramodern and quirky line readings that also show how things have changed. william macy's performance actually is in the 50s style, an interesting twist, and seems like a fish out of water in the modern setting.anyhow, if you like the original psycho, the psycho remake is like a great remix, taking qualities of the original and casting it in a new light, making you think and appreciate the original while also justifying its own existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a successful project, although it's not entirely as worthless as some people suggest. Since "Psycho" is so deeply ingrained in the psyche of pop culture, Gus Van Sant had to have known what he was taking on. He got a lot of hateful reactions for touching Hitchcock's masterpiece, which is a little silly. Of course any film can be remade, and his is an interesting idea that raises a great question: use the same script and film it almost the same way, and will it be the same experience? The best thing about this movie is how it makes you reconsider the first one. I was not crazy about the way Van Sant did a lot of this, for instance the gratuitous stab wounds on Marion's back in the shower scene. In fact, that whole shower sequence was the weirdest thing in the movie: it didn't have much of a jolt, whereas in the original film it is most definitely shocking, even after you know it is coming.Heche, Vaughn and Moore are all competent in the film. Nobody really manages to escape the pall of the original actors, however. It's like watching an eclipse; it's fascinating, but you can't look directly at it. I will admit I was one of the people who acted deeply offended at the very mention of this project. After having seen it, it is not a terrible film, and I actually like the idea in retrospect. I think the movie's biggest crime is that it is unnecessary, since the original holds up so well. However, the original "Psycho" would never be re-released to multiplexes, supposedly because modern (young) audiences could not or would not accept a film in black &amp; white. Having seen the original on the big screen once or twice, I can honestly say the movie is every bit as shocking and suspenseful as the director intended. The original remains a powerful experience. Conversely, this remake is merely an echo that probably spread over thousands of screens and yet carried none of the impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is my idea for the remaking of "Psycho" :</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian DePalma would direct. He's been trying to remake "Psycho" at least since he did "Sisters" (1973)so I say he should re-do the original. I would cast Melanie Griffith as Marion Crane, because I think she would be as sexy and as believable in the role as Janet Leigh was in the original. I would cast Meg Ryan as her sister, Leila Crane, because I have never seen Griffith and Ryan in the same film, and I think it would be fun. There would also be the resultant irony of Griffith's mother, Tippi Hedren, having played "Melanie Daniels" in the Hitchcock classic, "The Birds". I won't touch the story of Hitch having given 3 or 4 year old Melanie G. a doll inside a coffin as a gift, and the resulting misunderstanding.I would cast Liam Neeson as Sam Loomis, having thoroughly enjoyed him playing good guys very believably in "Rob Roy" and "Schindler's List".I would cast John Malkovich as Norman Bates. I think he would make a very scary Norman, based on how scary he was as the evil, psychotic ex-CIA agent in "In The Line of Fire".I would re-use the original Bernard Herrmann score. I am not sure if the remake should be in black and white or color. A drab, "reduced" color, such as was used in the 1984 version of "1984", with Richard Burton and John Hurt, and 1998's "Saving Private Ryan", might be best.Hitchcock's "Psycho" is a classic, and a masterpiece that could never be surpassed, or even approached, by any remake, but this DePalma remake I have envisioned here would, I think, have been a far more interesting tribute to the Hitchcock original than Van Sant's remake was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of comments here saying "why?" and "what is the point?" Well, I will tell you. I had not seen the original and despite it being a "classic" I had no desire to see it. I am not a fan of sixties style black and white films. I just don't like the style. I was the same with rebel without a cause, a great film, but I just found it lacking by todays standards. Anyway, When the film came out in 1998, I heard all the awful reviews and avoided it. partly because I heard it was the same as the 60's version and partly because of the bad reviews. But I saw it last night and I enjoyed it. It is a worthwhile film to see. OK, so the performances may not be as good as the 1960 film but how am I to know, I have not seen the 1960 film. As a standalone film, I thought it was really good. I felt that Norman was very creepy, I liked seeing the paranoia grow in the Anne Heche character and because I did not know what happened, I was on the edge of my seat all the way through it.Perhaps I should have watched the original and perhaps I should be more openminded to accept the old black and white film, but I didn't. So, I for one am glad they remade this classic as it gave me a chance to watch what I am sure is a truly great film.So, if you have not seen the original, I would highly recommend this modern piece of classic cinema.</fullReview>

You would think a man of his talent would know better.When you do a remake, either the original has to be little known or not very good.This remake (blasphemy) of the Hitchcock masterpiece fails to capture anything the original did.First off, making it in color, the black &amp; white film added the grainy feel "Psycho" needed. This makes it feel kind of like a boy band trying to cover an old Jimmi Hendrix tune.Secondly, it is a scene by scene remake. If you aren't going to add your own flare to the story, why even bother? Vince Vaughn, he is the biggest mistake of all or maybe it was Van Sant. Regardless, the whole reason Bates is so scary is because he is so innocent, so gentle, and appears to be so fragile. Here he is a sinister looking, pervert and Van Sant allows us to view him masturbating.Thrown in the mix with have some sudden flashes of S&amp;M and cows on the road. I don't know.Anyway, this film was a complete mistake. After watching it I carefully read the Old Testament and followed it's process of how to be cleansed after being defiled. I suggest all who've seen this do the same.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

THE lighting was too bright. All of the actors seemed tired of the movie and acted like "oh, get over it" The acting and dialogue seemed forceful, especially the scene with psychiatrist and the shower scene. There were some pointless scenes in the movie such as Norman touching himself when looking at Marion changing. Norman should have been more serious when he dressed like mother in the near end. He seemed to be happy dressed like his mother. The movie was too weak and not worth watching it for pleasure. I suggest you to watch the older version of Psycho first then compare the older one and newer one, and see how they differ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This recreation of Hitchcock's classic is quite well done by Gus Van Sant with the only major alteration being the different cast. Basically remaking the film frame by frame, with the same soundtrack and similar dialogue would seem pointless to some. I, however, enjoyed the movie - it gives younger film buffs a chance to experience the classic horror movie in a more up to date view with a great cast from today's film industry. Not the greatest, but definately worth seeing if you can just to relive the nightmare. Just don't watch it in a deserted hotel at night, you never know what could happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is never a good decision to remake a good classic...especially if that classic is a great one. Vince Vaughn is a pretty good actor, but nobody can capture Norman Bates as Anthony Perkins did...nobody. It is a waste to remake something that was already great, don't bother with this movie go rent the original. This movie should have never been made. Rating: 1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great remake of a classic thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Marion's boss tells her to put forty thousand dollars from a client into the company bank account, Marion steals the money and runs away with it. Along the way she decides to stop of at a motel, the Bates Motel which is run by the very strange Norman Bates. Whilst at the motel, Marion gets murdered whilst taking a shower. Her boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lila have no idea where she is or what happened to her though, so with the help of a detective, Arbogast they go looking for her. When they find out that Marion stayed at the Bates Motel, they undercover some weird and disturbing facts about Norman Bates and his 'mother'. The 1960 and this 1998 version of Psycho are both really good. Both have lots of suspense in them, feature good acting and eerie music, etc. I liked this 1998 version more though. If people were so against the remake of Psycho, then why did they watch it in the first place. They're obviously so hung up on the first one that it's 99% obvious that they wouldn't like this version anyway, not because it's bad, but because they just don't want to even try to like it. Anyway, Vince Vaughn is really good here and Psycho is definitely a movie to see and own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting idea &amp; a very brave decision by Van Sant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant must've had balls of steel to attempt this project. Gotta admire him (in a way) for having the gall to even suggest it! He must've known (in his heart of hearts) that it wouldn't work. He must've known how critics would react to something so blasphemous. He must've known that modern audiences wouldn't understand what he was trying to do. Yet he went ahead and did it anyway. Brave man.It's not awful. The cast give it all they've got (kudos to Vince Vaughn) and as a whole the picture (like the original) gives off a pretty eerie and frightening vibe. I think it's better to watch this movie without so much pop-culture cynicism attached. It's far more interesting and enjoyable that way. However, I can't defend it too much. A big part of what makes the original 'Psycho' so disturbing to watch (for me) is the fact that it's in black and white. It makes it seem A LOT more sinister. The update, in color, is like watching a horror movie on a sunny afternoon (when we all know that they're best watched at midnight with all the lights out..)Well done to Van Sant for proving that (after the huge mainstream success of 'Good Will Hunting' the year before) he still had it in him to do something this bold and experimental. But it still gets only 6/10 from me. Sorry Gus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great homage to good old Hitch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I don't quite understand what the problem is. I kind of liked this movie! This being in spite of the two following facts: a) I love the entire Hitchcock body of work, and b) I happen to have a film major. Both of which should qualify me as one who should totally disregard this project. At least according to some of you guys.Gus Van Sant, knowing it would cause controversy, chose to do a remake of a great film, a remake which in my humble opinion does not lag too far behind Hitchcock's original. Of course, Hitchcock had the advantage of doing it first (note: as based on a novel by Robert Bloch), but why shouldn't it be possible - or even encouraged - to try doing it again? I mean, as an experiment, and naturally, as homage? Those of us who have taken the time to watch the DVD documentary will know that these were the intentions of the entire cast and crew on "Psycho 1998". Not necessarily to do a "better movie", but to "try", to "study", and to "honor".The problem, as I see it, is that the notion of the original as ever superior is so firmly rooted in us that some of us are unable to see beyond these presumptions and hence, grasp a different view. The rule seems to be that nothing can be improved; one should not even try.People may like "Psycho 1998" or not, but no one should not use their disapproval as an excuse to throw their politically correct and/or somewhat arty-farty opinions in the face of those who happen to like Van Sant's film. Although yet a scarce few, we have feelings too. Go, Gus!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea takes a wrong turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of the Psycho remake project, I was disgusted with the idea--after all, why re-make perfection?Besides, Psycho was one movie I had studied numerous times and had used for teaching in some upper level classes at the high school level over the years, so I knew the original film does work (if this age group takes the time to view it).Then I heard that Van Sant was the director, which gave me pause...perhaps there was something to the project after all.I Read up on his idea of making an actual tribute to Hitchcock by attempting for the first time to actually duplicate his original movie, so I was hooked and destined to go ahead and see it.So I did at a midnight showing.From the audience, it appeared that Universal was accomplishing its goal--most of the audience were teenagers, and I know that the ones who sat immediately behind me had never seen the original.It was a weird experience knowing the film so well and now seeing a different version--kind of like seeing another stage adaptation of Hamlet or King Lear.The music was great--the original score was there, just enhanced to match the new technology and the same style for credits was there.Very cool shot over my fair city of Phoenix in the opening as Van Sant was able to accomplish what Hitchcock wanted to do but couldn't due to technological limitations.Few of the actors seemed comfortable imitating their predecessors though Anne Heche was adequate in mimicking Janet Leigh. Van Sant actually granted permission to the major actors to put something of their own into the roles, but Heche decided to attempt to replicate Leigh.William Macy actually seemed to grasp detective Arbogast's role the best of any of the "major" characters but he doesn't have many scenes. Other minor characters performed about as well as the originals, and Van Sant's cameo at the same spot as Hitch's was amusing.I found the other main characters far less effective. While John Gavin was a rather stiff Sam Loomis in the original classic, he at least had an intensity--there was no chemistry between Vitto M. and Anne Heche even though Van Sant had him play the opening scene in the buff. Later he flirts with Marion's sister and just comes off like a country bumpkin &amp; hardly heroic at the end.I expected more out of Julianne Moore, who was so good in Boogie Nights, but she just comes across as an uncaring, stiff Lila Crane more concerned about her walkman than about her sister. I almost lost it when she actually winks at Norman at the check in. And then Norman winks back!!!I can now appreciate what Anthony Perkins did for the Norman Bates role. I know that it's not really fair to compare Vince Vaughn to a movie icon...but Vaughn took on the role and decided to make it his own...What Vaughn does to Norman, Hitchcock would have slashed out with his own butcher knife and left on the cutting floor.The original Norman appears to be an overprotected, shy, retiring young man who in turn protects his beloved crazy mother. The flashes of anger that Perkins demonstrates are very controlled and internal...Not so with Vaughn. From the start he lets us know that he's a goofball, with a stupid laugh and sinister look. His violent mood swings give away far too much too early and in what has to be one of the worst ever choices for making the character his ownget ready...SPOILERhe decides to masturbate (complete with sound so the teens won't mistake what he's up to) during the classic voyeurism scene.SPOILERI know that Van Sant really attempted to work on Hitchcock's flawless timing, yet timing the scenes via the DVD didn't work. The pace seemed off for most of the movie--perhaps due to the color, so our focus is not as narrow as it is in black and white.Van Sant's added visual touches outside the opening shot aren't effective either. The added birds and bugs and lights to the cellar doesn't increase the shock when you meet Mrs. Bates.This movie never grabbed me like Hitchcock's original. Of course I realize that this is not fair. Perhaps the true judge for its success depends on whether today's teens are affected by it...I suspect they won't be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock... the best director of all time made the best movie of all time in 1960. It was called "Psycho" and changed the horror movies forever.In 1998 this masterpiece was made again. An exact remake, word by word... scene by scene. A totally knew way of making movies. We have seen remakes before, but not like this.I loved Hitchcock's classic. And I love this "Psycho" too. I mean.. it's exactly the same. Only more modern. I liked the idea... it was so very enjoying seeing everything again performed in a new environment.The actors were great, even if liked the original cast better. Perkins is Bates, but both Henry Thomas ("Psycho IV") and Vince Vaughn have made good performances playing Norman. In some scenes Vaughn is amazing, but also the opposite sometimes. Heche is great. Her Marion Crane is not quite the same as Leigh's, but I don't think it's intended to be that either.My following comment hasn't anything to do with the movie, but... isn't Heche a beautiful actress?All in all I deeply recommend this "new" masterpiece. Gus van Sant did a remarkable job making it. It's made for people like myself and it's a tribute to the best director and the best movie ever. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gus Van Sant has missed the point -- Hitchcock would laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Psycho was so great due to the use of Alfred Hithcock's groundbreaking cinematography and editing techniques to advance scenes that were unexpected and shocking to audiences in that era. Since then, filmmaking, like any other art form has progressed. Audiences have had almost 30 years to become desensitized to violence and horror. If Hitchcock were alive today and wished to continue achieving his goal of scaring audiences, it only makes sense that he would adjust his films to meet the changing needs required to actually frighten and shock people. Instead, Psycho (1998) is a film in which investigators still address people as "friend", and one major "modernization" is that one character is inexplicably wearing a walkman. [I hope this was a poor example of product placement rather than part of an actual vision by Van Sant.] There is only one thing frightening about a film set in the 1998 in which people talk, act, and dress like it's still 1950. And that's that millions of dollars were used to produce this uninspired, dull, boring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The frame by frame recreation Psycho 1998 works much better as experiment than film, but it's not altogether an unsuccessful experiment. Some of it doesn't work. Why do single girl Marion and the divorced Sam need to sneak around? What's so shameful about their affair? And some of the shots and filmmaking techniques, particularly the voice-overs during Marion's flight, come across as hokey and dated. But some of it works. And how. Julianne Moore comes across as more aggressive than the deferential Vera Miles as Lilah Crane, though they're speaking the same lines. And Vince Vaughn is absolutely terrific. He adds a much-needed virile spin to Norman Bates. This is a character, after all, that is traumatized by his sexual attraction to Marion, something that was missing from the original. His Norman has a necessary sexual menace that Anthony Perkins could never bring. (Vaughn's a star in the making, I think--equal parts Jack Nicholson, Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and Gary Cooper.) William H. Macy is terrific, too, as Arbogast. The film doesn't all hang together sometimes. So what? Not even Gus Van Sant's best films hang together 100%. (The Henry IV tangent in Private Idaho?) At least he's trying. He's busting some sacred cows, and that's refreshing. Why remake Psycho? Why the hell not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the original film, Hitchcock was doing what he thought made the best, scariest scenes for his movie. He was experimenting, doing things he hadn't done before, things which had never been done before, trying for maximum effect. He temporarily went from doing suspense, to doing a low-budget quickie horror. He killed the leading actress off 30 minutes into the film. Van Sant was doing a mirror image of something: copying it exactly, following the blueprint Hitchcock had laid out, rather than doing what he thought was best for the film. That, and add into that the fact that it was made decades later for a completely different audience, an audience who had grown up watching more graphic horrors, where everything is shown and nothing is left to the imagination, unlike the original story.The original black-and-white photography gave the viewers a false sense of tranquility in the surroundings, making the horror all the more shocking. The striking, overpowering colour photography of the remake, rather than subtle black-and-white tones, only serves to distract the viewers.Who would have expected the leading actress to be killed 30 minutes into the original film? No one.Who would have expected the leading actress to be killed 30 minutes into the remake? Everyone.Recycling the original film's score only reminds how superior the original was.Its bizarre casting of meathead Vince Vaughn as Bates, nut Anne Heche as Marion Crane, and several well knowns in minor roles (which only made their fans watch the film just to see their brief cameo, not caring about the movie itself) is the final nail in the coffin.</fullReview>

He looked like a big pervert monster. The point of Norman is he is supposed to look sweet and harmless. And he was so much bigger in size than Viggo Mortensen. Viggo looked too scruffy and crook like to be the hero Sam. Anne Heche didn't have the sweetness and classiness of Janet Leigh so she didn't invoke sympathy. What on earth was Julianne Moore doing in this movie? The original had a perfect cast and this remake was the opposite.Producers have to stop remaking perfect movies in a disastrous way eg Planet of the Apes with Mark Wahlberg, South Pacific with Glenn Close, The Great Gatsby with Mira Sorvino, Roman Holiday with Catherine Oxenberg, the Time Machine etc.This movie should never have been made.</fullReview>

The acting is flat out disgusting, EVERY actor in the movie looks like they're reading off of note cards. It honestly feels like you're at you're 6th grade son's Theatre Arts presentation of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Sam should be punishable by execution. Among all the ludicrous scenes my favorite in particular happens to be the scene where Arbogast gets killed on the stairs, real head scratching scene right here. What the f*** is up with the cow/thunderstorm shots in random spots of the scene? Credit where credit is due, it is original but the problem is it's also weird and really just flat out laughable. Whoever designed the look for mother's corpse at the end needs to go back to the drawing board... literally. I'd like to personally apologize to the late great Janet Leigh for the embarrassing piece of polar bear urine scene that was created to look like her infamous Shower Scene. Maybe the worst part of this trash but it's got plenty of competition. All in all this movie is just a complete failure, kind of a cool idea but it was so poorly acted and set up that it ended up being nothing more than a total slap in the face to anyone involved with the original masterpiece Psycho.</fullReview>

Some of them went on to do better things. (Vaughn, Mortissen). Others, not so much. (Heche). But they are just saying the lines, and not as well.Color vs. Black and White. Sorry, the movie worked because it was atmospheric in BW. Color doesn't make it work.And it's time to talk about the lack of subtlety. In the 1960 version, Norman spies on Marion taking a shower through a peephole. Got it. Nope, we have to hear him unzipping and (insert metaphor here!) Because 1990's audiences are stupid, and we won't understand he's aroused unless he hear him doing an act of self-gratification.Ann Heche is a large part of the problem, because she was really the Paris Hilton of the 1990's. "Please pay attention to me!" But here's the problem with ALL remakes. If something was good enough the first time, you don't need to remake it because it was fine. If something wasn't good enough, you probably can't fix it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you want to see the classic story of "Psycho", I've got three words of solid advice for you: rent the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any irony for me about the relationship between Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 thriller "Psycho" and the shot-for-shot 1998 remake by Gus Van Sant, it's that the original achieved my highest rating and the latter achieved my lowest rating. The only thing "shocking" about this copy of Hitchcock's most famous film is how a talented director as Gus Van Sant could have pulled off such an unqualified disaster.The plot, most of the dialogue, the lighting, and even the camera angles are exactly the same as they were in the original. Bernard Herrmann's eerie music score is even mimicked and re-conducted by Danny Elfman in an effort to stay as faithful as possible. The primary differences are that the remake is in color, features a different cast, and that it is not scary or off-putting or even very entertaining for that matter.I'm sure this was a very interesting experiment for Gus Van Sant. And this is the kind of film that will attract people interested in the film-making art form, including me. I ventured into this not only to see a remake of one of the all-time classics, but to see the results of the experiment: recreating a great director's masterpiece step by step with a different cast and modern technology. Unfortunately, the result is just a very pale and ugly carbon copy of what was a beautiful masterpiece.Even though Gus Van Sant's remake copies Hitchcock's film, it does not preserve the power and Van Sant made, in my opinion, a great many fatal errors along the way. It's really hard to imagine how this film could have worked out. Number one, Hitchcock's film was in black-and-white. Hitchcock could have shot the film in color, but he close black-and-white because he knew that it had more impact for this sort of story. Perhaps that was also part of Van Sant's goal: to see if shooting a black-and-white film in color would have an effect. In color, "Psycho" just comes off as weird. The cinematographer also made the error of copying the original lighting, for in color, it just creates too much contrast and there is no dramatic or eerie effect. And what I found just annoying were all of the weird, over-the-top flashbacks and storm images that kept interfering with the flow of the images. There is also the costume design. William H. Macy looks absurd in the costume as a private detective that looks like it's fit for a man twice his size. His jacket is too big, his tie too broad, his hat is far too big and ultimately he doesn't look like a detective, but as a kid in a dime-store costume.But ultimately, I think, the biggest error of the movie is the casting. Consider the cast of the original "Psycho." It's not only iconic, but it's perfect. And now compare that cast to the cast in this remake. We all remember Janet Leigh in the original and the way she was brutally murdered in the most infamous scene in horror movie history. While Anne Heche does make a sort of effort, it seems at times she's really rushing through her lines, perhaps aware already that the project is failing. Julianne Moore, a very talented actress, is wasted here as well in the role that Vera Miles originally played. William H. Macy just seems to be playing around. But the ultimate mistake was the casting for the part of Norman Bates. We all remember Anthony Perkins in the original (how could anybody forget?) and the tragic mistake in the remake was that his milestone performance was mimicked by none other than Vince Vaughn, who is not creepy and who I don't think could ever be creepy. I suppose Vaughn was cast because like Perkins, he does not appear creepy or off-putting from the outside or by his mannerisms. But Perkins was creepy and still is. Vaughn is not and I doubt he could be. And Anthony Perkins could freak out an audience effortlessly; Vaughn is clearly putting too much of an effort and failing, because ultimately, as fine of an actor as he is, this is not the role he was meant to take.In the end, Gus Van Sant's remake is really just an experiment in film scholarship gone bad and proof that when you are going to remake somebody else's film, to bring your own ideas and techniques to it. But you also have to remember, if you're going to remake a film, remake one that can be improved in at least some regard. "King Kong" (1933), for example, is a film that could be remade. But "Psycho" (1960) has nothing to be improved on and therefore it just seems blasphemous that it has not only been remade, but copied. And it's a very, very poor copy at that. No director, I feel, could have pulled this off. This should have been an idea that just remained on the shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but lacks much of what made the original great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hate this remake of "Psycho." I paid to see it twice during its initial (and brief) theatrical run, and liked it quite a bit. And I still do, actually, contrary to the oath all seem to swear that "it's not as good as the original." Okay, fine, I can accept that--Gus Van Sant's remake is not nearly as good as Hitchcock's genre-defining milestone, but it's not all that bad, either. That some have flunked the film on principle alone is disingenuous and critically unsound, but one does wonder: what's the point in remaking something that was only a hair away from greatness to begin with? Perhaps this question possessed more urgency in 1998, when 'remake' was a term that only occasionally popped up in reference to theatrical films. Nearly a decade later, remakes of all kinds (from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to Martin Scorsese's "The Departed") have infiltrated the multiplex, to the point where most are rather jaded at their presence, let alone inspiration. Some remakes have been inveterate disasters (both "Texas Chainsaw"s), while others have shown slight improvement over their source ("The Hills Have Eyes"; "Dawn of the Dead"). To its credit, Van Sant's "Psycho" remake--while quoting Hitchcock shot for shot--is humble and sincere before the altar of its source...but it just doesn't stand on its own.Cast-wise, the rather incendiary fresh faces have their ups and downs: Anne Heche brings a naivet to her performance as Marion Crane; Viggo Mortensen's Sam Loomis is a calmly disarming, aw-shucks kind of fellow (you can actually believe he runs a hardware store); the re-vamped Lila Crane is rendered well by Julianne Moore, trading Vera Miles' near-catatonic hysteria for a tough, punked-out sternness toward her AWOL sister (she has some great outfits, too); and William H. Macy brings a bit of middle-aged wisdom to the role of Private Investigator Arbogast. But the casting of Norman Bates will either make or break the film...and, unfortunately, Vince Vaughn's interpretation lowers the film several rungs--while closer in physical appearance to Robert Bloch's original concept, the towering, hulking Vaughn does not, however, fit within the parameters of Joseph Stefano's screenplay. His performance actually becomes frustrating, since it lulls back and forth between self-conscious awareness and glaring naivet; Anthony Perkins possessed a frightened innocence and unpretentiousness that made the original's startling revelation all the more shocking.Amid some dialog clipping here and there, Van Sant offers a few interesting narrative additions: Norman consummates his lust for Marion through the infamous peephole; a skin-mag is hidden in his child-like room; the murder scenes contain arbitrary flashes of disturbing images; and the addition of a basement taxidermy workshop is well-rendered. While the film lacks (not surprisingly) almost all the visceral menace of the original, several scenes are as hypnotically creepy: Norman's parlor-chat with Marion; Arbogast's questioning; the shower; and, oddly enough, Lila's examination of the upstairs bedrooms in the bates house (there is something genuinely creepy about the lighting and furniture arrangement). Van Sant does create chilling atmosphere, both literally (the pre-dawn wind rustling as Norman stands by the swamp) and figuratively (the precision of the slashes in the shower) through some great sound effects editing (definitely one of the film's high points).In interviews, Van Sant never had a decent (let alone good) reply to why he wanted to re-make Hitchcock's film in such a rigid manner. Indeed, the dialog is rhythmically off for its own sake, which makes for an awkward experience, and Vaughn simply cannot sustain the weight of such a well-known performance. While well-acted by its supporting cast and technically proficient, "Psycho" is in such a hurry (even with a few scenes trimmed or deleted, the film still runs 5 minutes shorter than the original) that nuance, subtlety, and mood seldom appears...and I've finally realized that those elements are what makes Hitchcock's film work so well, nearly 50 years later.</fullReview>

And so bad.Is it the color? The acting? The directing? All of the above? For whatever ironic reason, this color copy is about as appealing as a bad black and white photocopy of a color picture.

EXCEPT it will be in garish, pointless color, and we'll employ the very worst actors we can find, and we'll eliminate all traces of irony or suspense or menace from the original. Why, it'll be a huge hit!" Yes it will, if the groin counts. Van Sant should get no credit, but heaps of blame, for this travesty. To claim that this is a remake is sort of like copying "Tom Sawyer" in longhand, then claiming to have "re-written" it. Technically true but only to the letter of the law. He was overrated to begin with, and with this turkey, he showed the world what a true non-talent he is. Avoid this one as if it were "Titanic."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does anyone with any real sense think that there is any director ever who could remake a Hitchcock film and do better than Hitchcock himself? The ONLY good Hitchcock remake would have to be done by Hitchcock. This one is mostly unabashed plagiarism, with the exception of the cast being basically miscast. Not that they didn't try, but not any single one of them is able to muster enough zip to outdo their predecessors. Chad Everett is still a HAM, Ann Hecht is plain Jane compared to Janet Leigh, William Macy almost makes it but he has to wear the world's stupidest hat, Viggo Mortenson is too hillbilly and too small, and Vince Vaughn is too obviously feminine and too big. The film is 95% shot-for-shot theft of the original, with the other 5% being pretty lousy like the weak basement scene, and so consequently it is way too tedious. You are better off if you get ahold of Tom Railsback's excellent portrayal of Ed Gein in the film of the same name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant has distinguished himself in his career in the American cinema. Mr. Van Sant has been a man that is attracted to risky projects as proved by his films. That said, one can't imagine what made him undertake the direction of a definitive work such as "Psycho", which doesn't need another interpretation.The film was based on Robert Bloch's novel which was adapted brilliantly for the screen by Joseph Stefano. Alfred Hitchcock, an original director, seemed to be the natural choice to direct the screen treatment. In fact, this film falls into a category that would seem easy to imitate, but no one can improve in what was already a masterpiece.This 1998 film follows its model closely, but somehow, it never jells. In a way, we are all prejudiced against any remake of anything, but this was sacrilege. Most of the original is presented following its model and perhaps it would have made a better film if instead of copying the Hitchcock movie, it would have been done differently. Then, at least, one would have gone along with that new rethinking of the novel, and new adaptation, but instead the viewer keeps comparing it against the excellent film Mr. Hitchcock left us.We had avoided watching this version, but thinking the original was going to be shown on a cable channel, it turned out to be the new one. Obviously, despite the harsh criticism, Gus Van Sant got over this bad decision and came back with other films worthy of his talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This being a remake of a great movie so I'm told, I'm about to watch the original version of this movie some time soon so i can compare them more when i do... but this movie being made in 1998 was horrible. The death scenes were unbelievably crap... and what the director was thinking i do not know... because he completely ruined that movie. This is a movie you have to see to believe, The girl dies in the shower scene which left me wondering about the way she fell over... i was kind of wondering if this was the directors cut cause i know exactly what Buddy did to that body(freak). not to mention how disgusting it was with that hole in the wall and that ummm yeh thing that he did while looking in. OK ne way I'm kind of going off point id like to point out that the stabbing was the most unrealistic thing i have seen next to the old Godzilla movies. She was basically dancing in the shower while getting stabbed.. and there was absolutely no blood on the knife after like 9 stabs and shes still alive. OK to sum this all up because i have kind of gone on long enough about how horrible this movie is. OOO but first the music god the music was ridiculous... the cop was like following her and the suspense music was horrible it went on for like 10 minutes even after the cop had left. -Horrible Acting -Horrible Suspense Music -Vince Vaugn (good actor, but not really suited for the part) -Most unrealistic and worst death scenes i have ever seen. -Ruined a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good on it's own, but will always be compared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is like a younger boy whose parents raise him in constant comparison him to his older, successful brother. It's hard not to make comparison to the Hitchcock original when everything in the remake forces you to consider the original. But even if the film hints at another picture as obviously as it done here, a review can only be just if it tries to understand the remake as a picture of it's own. From that perspective, van Sants film isn't so bad. He has a clear sense for nuances, he takes care of even the smallest details. The cast is very good: Vaughan is great, though no new Anthony Perkins (but who could ever be that?) and acts very believable. Moore is great as ever, but I'm biased here because I love her. Macy makes the very best of his small role. Even Robert Forster in his short appearance adds to the overall quality. The only reservation is Mortensen, which is caused by the fact that he wants to make his characters portrayal too realistic in the first part of the film ? thus overacting a bit. Best credits must go to Anne Heche who, as mostly, delivers a brilliant performance. That said, it's a good film, though we all know the story and can't expect many surprises (a few are in it, though). It was an interesting idea to re-use Bernard Herrmanns score in a beefed-up version by Danny Elfman (and adding some more modern End Credits). By the way, it should be mentioned that Ed Gein, the inspiration for Norman Bates, was no serial killer, as is often stated, but killed two people only ? just as Bates does in Psycho. Recommended with 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read Your Borges: Classics Are Meant to be Screwed With</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I refer to the great little short story, "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote", by Jorge Luis Borges. The gist of it is the author has cribbed Don Quixote, word for word, and passed it off as his own. But because his context is totally different from that of the original author of the work -- well, it's a completely new way of reading the same words. In this instance, Gus Van Sant is taking an extremely familiar text, Psycho, and re-crafting it knowing not only that everybody has already seen the original, but that the last forty years have seen imitation after imitation that diluted the original shock so that re-viewing the original Psycho is practically quaint. Re-casting, even for a shot by shot remake (which this isn't, quite), inevitably changes the dynamic, the same way a new production of "Hamlet" with the same old words but with new actors and a new director will put a new spin on the old bard's blue prose. You can't tell me that William Macy in the Martin Balsam detective role, or the skinny and sexually controversial Anne Heche in the place of Janet Leigh's vivacious and busty Maron Crane doesn't change how you understand the characters. Vince Vaughn's Norman is definitely a different physical take -- especially if you saw him in 'Clay Pigeons' and remember him. That's the kind of re-interpretation the viewer has to do, and I strongly suspect that's the kind of playing-with-context Van Sant had in mind, all the while working tightly within the confines of Hitchock's original scenario.It's also worth noting the Hitchcock original was not perfect; the pithy, sew-it-up ending, the shallow psychological explanation of Norman Bates' motives, the unresolved characters of Sam and Lila. Van Sant doesn't try to "fix" these problems, much, but the better performances (vis a vis the original actors' performances) in the roles of Lila, Sam, and Arbogast definitely add a little dimension without monkeying with the script.Would I recommend this instead of the original? No. If you haven't seen the original, see it first, then see the re-make. That's the point!This is by no means a totally successful experiment, but it's a brave one, and a chuckle for true fans of the original. If you don't take it too seriously, and you don't take the original like it was some sort of biblically-infallible master text, you might well get something out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American cinema sometimes goes into ridiculous territory and director Gus Van Sant's remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (released in 1960) is one of those cash cow products that few cared about and fewer wanted to see. The name says it all: this is a complete copy of the original, filmed shot for shot with a nearly identical soundtrack. The only real variations are the colorization and the performers. Anne Heche is an embezzler. She runs off to the Bates Motel after a terrible thunderstorm and meets up with shy and somewhat strange inn-keeper Vince Vaughn. Immediately it becomes apparent that something is not quite right. The famous shower scene is replayed and now Heche's sister (Julianne Moore) and lover (Viggo Mortensen) start to get worried and begin a fevered search with the help of private investigator William H. Macy. When each reaches the Bates Motel, what will the outcome be? Hitchcock's "Psycho" was unlike anything ever experienced by the cinema. Van Sant's version is not a terrible movie, but really what is the point of remaking any of Hitchcock's productions? When it comes to "Psycho", stick with the original. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This version is better. Ha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to do this quickly so I'll just quickly describe what I didn't like.The sets were pure crap. Psycho was not a film that should have been modernized. Part of the aura around the original was that the buildings were designed how younger people in the 90's had never seen them before. In this one, the famous house house that gave me nightmares when I was a kid has lights on the front and is made with brick. The motel is yellow. That reminds me. Color really hurt this movie. The colors were way too bright. Marion wears an orange dress, the motel is yellow, and mother is blond. How scary is that? You don't put Michael Myers in orange do you? Leatherface wasn't one to wear pink, either. These small details are things that effect the movie that you can't always notice. The imagery in a movie means alot. If you come out of a really good movie you aren't going to be able to pick out every good thing about it. If you change some details it can effect the entire movie. That's why some directors are better than others and there is more to it than moving cameras around.Oh yeah, the shower scene sucked. "More intense," right. The first one was WAY tougher. Mother creeps in, rips the curtain open as the music starts and stabs. In this blondie mommy opens the curtain. No music. They look at each other. Scream. Slice. OooooooooooH, scary! Yeah, right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired remake of one of Hitchcock's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there's little I can add at this point, except to say that I concur with most of the previous comments. When I first saw this film, my impression was that it was someone's film school grad project. I just couldn't imagine any other reason for someone to make an almost shot-for-shot, line-for-line remake of Hitchcock's original.The argument that the film needs to be updated for today's audiences doesn't wash either, because the film misses so many opportunities for updating, that some things that worked in 1960 look silly in 1998. For example, why do Marion and Sam meet at a motel during her lunch hour? In 1960 (actually, the film was released in '60, but it was really written and shot in '59, and has a very "fifties" feel to it), they do so because any kind of sexual liaison not between man and wife had to be concealed. In fact, back then, even a husband and wife might prefer it not be known that they "did it" over lunch, and couldn't wait until it was decently dark out.The fact that Janet Leigh's Marion is sleeping with a man-not-her-husband at all reveals her as a bit of a rebel in 1960, and stealing $40,000 doesn't come as such a shock; however, when Anne Heche's Marion insists on concealing her relationship with Sam in 1998, prudery and repression are suggested, making her seem an unlikely impulse thief.Moreover, Sam's dilemma of not being able to marry a woman he can't support seems foolish by 1990's sensibilities. Such financial niceties just don't stop people now.Also, the sad fact was back in the 1960s, a woman who was pushing 40, and never married was presumed to be desperate. This is important to the plot as a factor in Marion's motivation. Not only is Anne Heche younger than Janet Leigh in the same role, but in 1998, the same desperation is no longer presumed. It has to be explicitly shown, and it never is.So the $40,000 is changed to $400,000, and Lila wears a Walkman? So the gore and sex are more explicit? These are surface differences that don't support the whole remake premise. As long as the producers wanted to remake the film as a carbon copy, perhaps it would have been sounder to leave it in 1960. Otherwise, motive and characterization are much more desperately in need of updating than the price of a house.That said, I don't think this is strictly a bad film-- just so very unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very difficult movie to review. I can't call it good or bad, it's just interesting.I love the original Psycho and I find this one interesting. The simple fact that it is a remake of what possibly is the most iconic film of all times is impressive by itself. What kind of crazy genius would want to remake perfection? I like the idea that it shatters the untouchable sanctity of this movie (and of any other movie). It reminds us of a simple fact: it's just a movie.Yes it is blasphemous, yes it is a homage.What to say about the shot by shot? Why not? After all if the original is perfection, why not keep it that way? Once again, it's just interesting.Every choice Gus van Sant is motivated by a reason: the use of colour, the shot by shot, the few details he changed and those he kept, the use of technology that did not exist at the time and the decision to keep the same technology for some scenes when better technologies now exist. There is a reason for every single one of those decisions and these reasons are neither good or bad, they're just reasons. I think we just need to admit Gus Van Sant wanted to have fun remaking Psycho and I'm sure he had a blast. So insofar, this is a perfectly successful movie.So sit back and enjoy. In the DVD, it is explained that they meant for you to be watching two movies at the same time. That watching the Psycho remake, you are constantly rewatching in your mind the original and comparing the two. It's exactly what happens. You can enjoy this movie because you are constantly thinking back "was it exactly like that in the original", "oh yeah, I remember that shot" or "oh in the original, it was like that, not like this". You're basically enjoying the original while watching this one. So why not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, the remake of Psycho is not trying to improve on the original and as for those who are still wondering 'Why?', it is all made abundantly clear by Gus Van Sant on the DVD release of this film. Psycho (1998) not only is a technical masterpiece but is also very well acted and possibly even better acted than the original. Each actor in the film does their best to make the character their own as it would have been more of an insult if they'd imitated the original actors.Vince Vaughn was never supposed to be like Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates. He is genuinely creepy in this role and does a fantastic job. Julinanne Moore also shows how good an actor she really is by giving her character a totally different presence in the film compared to Vera Miles' performance. Anne Heche and Viggo Mortensen are also good leaving William H. Macy who seems to be the most out of place.Psycho manages to translate well to the 90's as when I saw this film, I had seen the original along with a friend on the left side of me. While another friend of the right hand side who hadn't seen the original was terrified and thought it was fantastic. It seems the only thing people have against this film is that it still actually is Psycho. If Gus Van Sant had made this film a modern slasher, it would have lost all credibility. Van Sant pays tribute to the original film by keeping it exactly how it is and should be.So with improved acting, up to date technology, this is an interesting way of taking a modern look at a classic. Hearing the score in digital sound was brilliant and the shower scene still packs a punch with those more realistic stabbing sound effects. This film is not a bad movie, it's just different to anything we've seen before. I thought A Perfect Murder was a very poor take on Dial M for Murder yet that film got away with it.People are forgetting about the 'Psycho remake bashing' that took place when the film was released and are now watching the film with an open mind on video and DVD. Slowly this film is getting more popular and is already being included in some film studies subjects at Universities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True wit is often lost on the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film here is a lovely example of true post-modernism, folks, not unlike Warhol's Campbell's soup can or Brillo pads ('course a lot of not-too-bright people didn't "get" those, either). Put it this way: when you hear Sinatra or Tony Bennett singing The Beatles' "Something", do y'all freak out?? Song covers feature the same melody, the same words and very often a similar stylistic approach. Does this constitute an insult to the original artist? I think not. The difference here is simply the difference between a three-minute pop song and an hour-and-forty-five-minute film. The pervasive comment from IMDb users seems to be, "I can't believe I wasted x number of hours of my life watching this drivel". In my opinion, a true movie lover would never utter these words; a so-called "bad" movie can be just as instructive and thought-provoking, in its own way, as a "good" one. (I don't even regret watching "Moulin Rouge!", and that's saying a lot.) The more films one watches, the more informed one becomes about cinema in general. Anyway, as I'm pushing 40, an hour and forty-five minutes doesn't seem much longer than three minutes anymore.Back to "Psycho", though: if the sheer wit of the mere idea of constructing a shot-for-shot remake of any classic film does not amuse you, "Psycho" ain't gonna work for you. To me, this admittedly brazen curiosity of a flick is consistently provocative, ingenious and hilarious. I would think that any cinephile would find the recreation of exact shots fascinating, as I did. Van Sant's own (sometimes bizarre) additions, which occasionally nudge the sexual innuendos of the past into 90s realism, exemplify the playfulness and wit of the whole enterprise. Amongst other things, Van Sant's film is a parody of and commentary on modern Hollywood remakes, or, more precisely, rehashes. Give the public a movie that they've seen a million times under a million different titles, include a condescendingly predictable storyline and beloved stars, and they eat it right up. Familiarity breeds contempt? Not in American moviegoers, it doesn't. Now--Van Sant takes this concept and does it deadpan literal, tongue-in-cheekily giving audiences what they supposedly want, a GD carbon copy of a well-known story, and they hate it! Now, that's funny. 'Course old Gus knew that's what would happen, unlike his producers, who were no doubt hoping for an updated cash cow, but he went ahead and did it anyway. To me, that makes him an extremely witty guy. ('Course then he went ahead and made actual Hollywood drivel like "Finding Forrester", but that's another story.) This is literally the only film he's made since the glory days of "Drugstore Cowboy" and "My Own Private Idaho" (two of the best films of the last fifteen years) that interested me in the slightest.Of course, "Psycho" doesn't realize all of its aims (may I mention here that if Vince Vaughn decides to retire from acting, or whatever it is he thinks he's doing, I'll be a happy man?)--but what film does? I love the people who are all hot and bothered over the fact that the memory of Hitchcock, the great artist, has been insulted, even desecrated here; man, most folks don't have one-tenth of the sophistication that's required to truly appreciate what Alfred Hitchcock was doing, nor do they really care. It's just the kneejerk reaction to Van Sant's experiment: "Oh, you insulted Hitchcock!!" Cracks me up. As does Van Sant's "Psycho"; it's as subversive as any major studio film will ever be.</fullReview>

The only subtle difference between this and the original are there to enhance the film and keep today's short attention spanned audiences interested. Clearly it could never have been superior to the first, but that was never the original intent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Underrated Experimental film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was nice to have to sit through a lecture today at my University that was for once not about the original 'Psycho'. It was actually about the controversial remake by Gus Van Sant - a film that I've always been amazed at the negative reaction by older filmgoers around the world.From the reaction in class today, it's nice to know that like me, there are plenty of people my age (in there mid 20's) who liked the original but like the remake even more just for trying something knew and appropriating a classic for the younger generation. So maybe in 40 years time this film will become a classic once the backlash has died down. After all, the original 'Psycho' was panned upon it's release and didn't achieve cult or classic status until the late 70's.This really is not only an interesting film but also a very good one. Yeah, yeah, Vince Vaughn is no Anthony Perkins but who said he was supposed to be? He does a great job at re-interpreting the character as does over cast member in the film.After watching the original film a few weeks ago, as much as I still like it, I find every character in the film - with the exception of Norman Bates - to be flat and very uninteresting.John Gavin's performance in the original 'Psycho' was terrible as he was nothing but a man there to solve a mystery while the same character in the remake is a laid back cow-boy thanks to Viggo Mortensen. Julianne Moore's aggressive performance as the gay sister Lila makes Vera Miles' performance look like it would be better suited for a soap opera. Anne Heche makes for an interesting Marion Crane and comes across as far more 'human' than Janet Leigh did.Take the amazing performances and add some surrealistic colour that is quite unique, plus some clever cinematography from Chris Doyle, Bernard Hermann's groovy score (in stereo!) and the result is a film that is creepy from an entertainment point of view and a fascinating film from an analytical point of view.The original 'Psycho' was way before it's time and it's nice to know Van Sant was able to shoot some scene's off Hitchcock's original story boards that he wasn't allowed to film in 1960. This remake was never meant to be better than the original 'Psycho' but it was supposed to re-create something that cinema has lost these days and it pulled it off beautifully.All those people who detest this film for simply being a remake of 'Psycho' really have no idea what film making is really about and should be very pleased that Gus Van Sant didn't turn 'Psycho' into a tacky 'slasher' film. He stuck to the original ideas and at the same time challenged us to open our minds a little. For these reasons, I love this film and am more than happy to give it a 10 OUT OF 10 (not that it will make much difference to the score of the film on the main page).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting experiment - not to mention a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took guts for Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting) to make this film. More so than a horror movie, the film works as a thriller and even as an art house movie. I love the look of the film - the use of color is overly saturated and makes it look so cool (the abstract imagery during the murders really ads to the scenes).The cast all go out of their way to deliver a performance that is different to the original. Even using the same lines, they create characters who are different. Vince Vaughn had the hardest job and makes a goofier Norman Bates (but he's still creepy) while Anne Heche makes for a very 90's acting Marion Crane. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore add two stellar performances in the second half of the film.Would everyone give this film a break! It was an experiment and a very clever one. It even had the blessing of Pat Hitchcock. It was never trying to be better than the original or threaten it either so whats the big deal. Why didn't everyone have a problem with 'A Perfect Murder'? That was a pretty bad remake of 'Dial M For Murder'. It would have been worse if Van Sant took 'Psycho' and made a 90's style slasher film out of it - thank God he didn't.All those people still asking 'Why? Why? Why? Why?' - why don't you go try look for the answer yourself. The answers are all on the DVD commentary and documentary (see 'Psycho Path'). Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' rocks!!8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it interesting to see a classic film remade word for word and shot for shot. It shows how good the acting and direction was in the original. Sometimes it is just an expression, an inflection of even a shadow that makes a scene really work or not. Certainly, the old adage that 90% of a good film is in the casting and no one in this film was comparable to the cast in the original. Even Macey, a fine actor, could not approach Martin Balsam's Arbogast. Vince Vaughan was embarrassing but proved how brilliantly subtle Anthony Perkins' was as Norman Bates. I think Vaughan deserves a little bit of credit for having the courage (Insanity?!) to take on the role because no actor in their right mind would do something that was done in such an iconic manner. Even the most minor characters in the original hit home runs with a minimum of screen time and dialogue. None did so in this remake. It is a mystery why this film was made but it helped me affirm the genius of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like the original, so there was a slim chance I was going to enjoy this 1998 remake starring Vince Vaugn and Anne Heche. This film isn't as bad as some may say that it is. It's performances by the actors are about a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10, not amazing but certainly not bad. I did appreciate how they stuck to the original. Almost everything about the original is in here, even how the camera shots work, so that was cool to see. Now u will say that i did not enjoy William H. Macy in the film, out of his element I thought. Julianne Moore was good in her role at least. Of course everyone knows what happens in the film because of the immense fame of the 1960 classic Psycho. Now i do think that the twist ending on both films was clever. Although to me, nothing else was clever or entertaining abt the original classic or this remake. There is one scene where Vaugn peeps through a peephole and touches himself while watching her undress (no nudity) that scene was a little awkward and kinda unnecessary. I did love Viggo Mortesian and Anne Heche in the movie, they did a good Job here. The script and dialouge was kinda lacking overall, nothing that special there. 5/10 overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes there have always been remakes and sequels. The lack of imagination for most of these is common knowledge. James Bond is successful so new secret agents are suddenly prominent in the movies. This is OK, although watching someone like Dean Martin or Charles Coburn is difficult. Here we have he worst of the worst because not only do we have a remake, we have one where the writers and directors simply steal everything from the original, cast actors who don't seem to belong (I'm not criticizing their abilities; many are excellent in other roles), and try to attract an audience who can't abide a black and white film. Hitchcock may have mistreated his actors, but he knew how to pick them. How anyone could reproduce that boyish evil that Tony Perkins exudes is the first hint. The fact of the matter is that as I watched this and mentally compared the film I have seen at least 25 times, I became uneasy, like I was a voyeur. As much as it is a copy of the original, it isn't at all because of the screen presence of "strangers." I was gratified that, for now, directors have not tried this again. Just for the record, a remake is fine if the new film takes some risks, updates, takes a different tack, etc., etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A women embezzles $400,000 and plans to getaway with her boyfriend, she stops at the Norman Bates motel in which her fate ends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1998 film Psycho directed by Gus Van Scott is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film "Pycho" written by Robert Bloch who's book is based on a real story based out of Wisconsin. Unlike the 1960 film this film was in color. The main characters are Marion Crane (Anne Heche), Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomes (Viggo Mortenson). After embezzling $400,000 from her employer Marion Krane plans to flee with her boyfriend with the money. Marion fate runs out when she stops at the Bates motel where Norman Bates a man with multiple personalities murders her. After Marion cannot be found her sister Lila Crane and boyfriend Sam Loomes goes to visit the Bates hotel after the private investigator Milton Arbogast (William Macy) does not return from the motel after contacting Lila and making her aware that Marion was at motel. The color provided more of a horrific and suspenseful feel. Gus Van Scott version showed more bloody scenes than the Hitchcock version. The sound and music in both movies were similar. The cinematographer Christopher Doyle uses great panning techniques as well as deep focus shots and focus that provided kept my heart racing and left me in suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen the original Alfred Hitchcock film then i wouldn't recommend watching this before you do, the fact that the main character is played by a 'psychotic' Vince Vaughan is comical in itself. Don't get me wrong though it did have a twist that kept me guessing until the end, which is why I've given it a moderate 4/10... The Music keeps you in suspense unless you've seen the Simpsons episode where they mock the film found that amusing and couldn't take the stabbing scenes seriously. Watch this if you fancy a laugh with your friends (and your know which scene is the funniest, cant beat Vince Vaughan in drag) Psycho is not scary it's just a pretty disturbing storyline which will definitely make you think twice before stopping at any Motel on the highway. Enjoy this Pyschotic Madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose my reaction to the 1998 re-make of 'Psycho' is pretty much the same as most others'. What's the point? Why go to the trouble? And not just a re-make... one that is intentionally almost identical, shot for shot and line for line, to the original. The director says it was an 'experiment.' I thought it was perhaps intended to be like a Broadway show that is revived with a different cast. They do that all the time and people don't have a problem with it. Why should a film be any different? I'm not sure why, but it is. Maybe because it's committed to film and thus has a kind of permanence to it. The scene-by-scene re-creations are extremely variable. For instance, the famous shower scene is a complete botch. It hasn't a tenth of the intensity of the original, almost as though they knew they couldn't get it right and just said, the hell with it, let's get it over with and move on. I know as I watched this version of 'Psycho,' my main interest or curiosity was in thinking, "I wonder how Anne Heche will deliver the next line." After a while, I grew less and less curious. Sometimes, with a truly great movie, people will make the well-intentioned observation, "That movie stands up every bit as well today as when it first came out. You could make it today and not change a thing." I don't believe that anymore, not after having seen this. The first scene's dialogue strikes me as very awkward, not at all the way two people in that situation would talk now. This doesn't take away from the original; we watch it, knowing it takes place in 1960 and our minds make allowances for that. You could even argue that it adds to the film's charm. To set the remake in 1998 and yet have Anne Heche recite the same lines Janet Leigh did just doesn't work. (And that begs another question... why bother to update it to present day?) Speaking of Anne Heche, she doesn't seem very comfortable with the material, or even particularly interested. Heche's main expression looks to me as though she wonders what she's doing here. And Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? I don't think so. It might be good for laughs at a frat party but nothing more. In fact, the 'impersonations' of these two characters veer closely to parody at times, not intentionally I don't think, but parody nonetheless. The other characters are 're-imagined,' you might say, by the actors playing them. William H. Macy comes off best as the detective Arbogast. He's not trying too hard and he's the only one in the film whose performance is up to standard; it's as though he's acting in an ordinary film, which is good. Viggo Mortensen turns John Gavin's straight-arrow Sam Loomis into a mumbling space cowboy. And Lila Crane as played by Julianne Moore is no longer an insistent worry-wart, she's an in-your-face hothead. Generally, the new portrayals are more distractions than improvements. Especially since the dialogue is approximately 98% the same as the original. So the film is one of those that probably seemed like a good idea late one night over drinks, but the end result leaves you shaking your head. I'm surprised somebody didn't say, a few days into the actual shooting, "you know, we ought to forget the whole thing."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the ONLY FULLY copied thing in this remake are the opening credits -- apart from the use of green replacing black.And so, both Janet Leigh's and Anne Heche's names are listed at the very end of the actors names -- both starting with AND and ending with AS MARION CRANE --, both shown, separately written, in the same larger fonts as those of both films stars (1960: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin. 1998: Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy). Even in its credits, and as much as it could, the new version imitated the first.All the other imitations are rarely, if ever, exactly the same (and I'm not talking about the locations or the costumes). If compared very carefully, this version is NOT an exact frame-to-frame remake of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST... before you see this - you will then know WHO is the MASTER &amp; who is the wannabe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, may I preface my review with the information that I studied the original film in college and have seen it several dozen times - each time I learned/still learn something new. The original "Psycho" is one of the greatest films ever made, because of its subtle direction and usage of light/shadow that can only be produced in black &amp; white. Since this remake is a theoretical shot-by-shot remake, I will anatomize it in my review and their may be some spoilers for those who have yet to see this must-see film. If you are an aspiring filmmaker, this is a must-own and see several times type of film - the original film presents a great tutorial for direction, production, acting, lighting design and most of all, cinematography. There can only be one master... and his name is Hitch.Well, now I have seen this... in full frame on STARZ on my 61" TV. I fell into it late tonight strictly by accident, just missing the opening credits and hotel scene. I joined in during the bank scene where Marion talks with the eccentric millionaire client, excellently portrayed by Chad Everett. In fact, all of the movie up until she meets Norman Bates was dead on... Anne Heche was almost perfect with the body language, movement, posture, gestures, facial expressions imitating Janet Leigh. I say "almost" because without b/w photography, it's just not fair as the light/shadow contrast on her face in the second car (especially) driving at night in the rain towards her final destination was missing, leaving her facial expressions nearly there. The Highway Patrolman was perfectly cast and shot and Anne Heche with her movements being startled awake was a dead ringer for Janet Leigh's performance. However, in those in-car driver scenes, her facial/eye expressions paled to the late Miss Leigh's dramatically, but it was a good attempt. The used car salesman was not as good, but still fairly, simply acted. For the first part of the movie, everything clicked... all the casting, original scored music, cinematography was good, but once Marion made it to the Bates Motel it all went downhill. Vaughn proved he is quite talented and gave an admirable job of acting, but at first came off too stable/normal, in control of himself, too macho/strong. Later, in the movie, he seemed to slip more into a mousy character and even stutter more (where was all the stutter in the parlor scene?), but it was too little, too late... the believability was gone. The parlor scenes didn't come off right... Norman just did not look like he was messed up in the head as he did in the original - the significant stuttering over the word "falsity" was gone as was the EXTREMELY poignant gesture of the hand being affectionately placed on the stuffed bird while stating "actually, it's more than a hobby." The peeping/masturbation scene was icky and an unnecessary modification to the original just plain peeping scene. The shower scene was very good, though and the petrified body of Marion was convincingly made to appear dead - kudos to Miss Heche. King of recent remakes, Viggo Moretnsen just did not have Sam's overpowering, calming, rock-steady macho presence as was portrayed in the original. Julianne Moore just did not have it at all... she is NO Vera Miles - there was little, if any emotional depth. William H. Macy was very good as Arbogast and brought back slightly more believability to the film's scene he was in. His superb acting juxtaposed Vince Vaughn's into being much better than earlier appearances, so does that mean Heche lacked as an actress? No - it means he was either less prepared, not yet fully established into the role or the direction. The biggest thing missing was the very human performances.The ending/final credits were really awful... did not even come close to the original.I give this 5 out of 10 stars for the first half of the film which was 9/10 stars (a near remake masterpiece, except for Vaughn), but the second half got only one star and that went for Macy's portrayal and Vaughn's uneven performance... the rest was just pure junk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that nothing, NOTHING, can replace Alfred Hitchcock's original masterpiece. It's a classic film of the highest order.However, this remake by director Gus Van Sant is also good in it's own right. It's a daring experiment to be sure, and we all know how Gus Van Sant loves his experimental films such as GERRY and ELEPHANT, and the new film LAST DAYS. This shot for shot remake still contains many of the elements that made the original so great. At first, I thought that the casting was for crap. Anne Heche as Marion Crane? Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates?! But then, the performances all kind of grew on me, and I liked the film more and more, and finally accepted it for what it was to begin with: an experiment.The other thing about this film that I really loved was the adaptation of the score by, none other than, Danny Elfman.I guess I can finally recommend this film. And trust me, I'm the world's biggest film snob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watcheable For Anne Heche's Performance Only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I wasn't exactly wowed by Hitchcock's original, and the only reason I started watching this version was because it was on late-night TV and I had nothing better to do. That said, what kept me watching was Anne Heche's performance. Did Van Sant give the Marion character more to say or do? Certainly, I found Heche's performance far more engaging than Janet Leigh's. Heche had presence. And it was only after her demise that the film lost its plot. Then it just seemed to return to a carbon copy of the creaky, old original.Why Julianne Moore took on the nothing role of the sister is beyond me. (And what was the Walkman crap about?) Memory tells me that Vera Miles had the pivotal role in the original. In this film the impact of the sisters was fully reversed. If I found my sister had been murdered by a psycho, I don't think I'd sit calmly by whilst some expert delivered a monologue about how the psycho had become a psycho. Where was the emotion? Like everyone else, I guess, I was left just wondering why they went to the expense. If the addition of color meant so much, why not just colorize the original. Other than Heche's subtle, multi-layered performance, I don't think this version added anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a waste. (my first review!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original psycho was a wonderful film... one of the first movies i remember seeing that actually scared me. A classic of film-making in all its glory. You would think that a shot-by-shot remake would be exactly that right? But something went terribly wrong here. Ill give you the short list.A)The actors chosen for this movie fail to work. The biggest example is Vince Vaughn as Norman bates. Anthony Perkins' performance was unique for the role, almost as if he fell into it. His madness seemed compulsive, as you always knew there was something a little off about him but you couldn't quite put your finger on it. There are several actors that possibly could recreate this performance, but Vaughn is not one to try. He almost seems to be trying too hard to act weird, and it comes off as fake. Another bad casting job was viggo mortison as Sam loomis. Moritson has an underlying weirdness to him, someone that shouldn't be chosen for a role such as that. The only actor i think that carries his weight is William H. Macy as Arborghast.B)A shot-by-shot remake would have been i think better, but this movie fails on that too. Such as adding wet noises to the voyerism scene... which instead of being disturbing and creepy, is almost funny. Anne Heche does a horrible job of conveying what Marion is thinking, by giving facial ticks and expressions to symbolize what she is thinking. not necessary. one almost expects a voice over to come on and draw it out for everyone.C)The addition of color shows that when a wonderful movie is made in b&amp;w, that it should stay that way. Poor Marion is stuck with costumes that look like a fabric store vomited on her, costumes that may have worked in b&amp;w. there also seems to be more blood when it is colorized, leaving very little to the imagination, delivering a gross-out instead of a glass-shattering tension breaker.Oh i could go on forever. but as a final thought, you may also notice that the conversation at the end shows that a completely unnecessary scene in the original will serve the same purpose in a remake. do yourself a favor and rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the original Psycho when I was nine years old, right away it became my favorite film and remains so to this day. In 1998 when I was fourteen I saw the preview for the re-make and was excited to see it, I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original but it being my favorite movie I had to give it a try. Big mistake, but hey I was fourteen. None of the actors really fit the roles they were given, most importantly Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. I personally have nothing against Vaughn as an actor, and I certainly wouldn't expect him to top Perkins in this role but they could have done much better. Perkins portrayed Norman as a shy and withdrawn man, the product of an abusive childhood. Vaughn's Norman is more sinister and seems to have more evil intent throughout the movie, you just can't feel sympathy for him like you do Perkins. They also take it a step way too far by having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress before her shower. This leaves you with the feeling that Norman is little more than your average pervert who would probably expose himself to you while wearing a trench coat some night. It was degrading to the character and useless, it's not hard to tell that Norman has issues with women and his sexuality from his first interactions with Marion. I suppose that's modern day cinema for you though, nothing will pass unless there is blatant sexual overtones.Do yourself a favor, see the original and stick with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho (1998) was an unnecessary remake of the classic Hitchcock horror film. I don't even have the foggiest idea why the director thought it would be a cool idea to try and remake the original. Not only did he do it but he did a scene by scene re-shoot of it (with bad results might I add). Sometimes people just don't know when to either so no to a stupid idea or they just don't care. Perhaps it's a little from column A and a little from Column B in this case. They also changed the tones and attitudes of the characters. Another reason not to even bother with this movie.The only thing that's even worth mentioning about this abortion of a picture was the beautiful cinematography by the legendary Christopher Doyle H.K.S.C. Other than that there's nothing else to recommend about this movie unless you're either curious or "don't like to watch old movies".Not recommended, unless you want to see how not to remake a movie or want to watch some brilliant cinematography.Hollywood needs to have some imagination. Remaking old movies and T.V. shows shows signs of a lack of creativity, Big time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curious lesson to film makers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake a classic film scene by scene using modern film techniques and proven actors; can't fail can it? Wrong! This film is an object lesson to directors that a film is more than simply cinematography and dialogue. Somehow, the original Hitchcock Psycho is brilliant and this modern clone isn't. I regret to have to say that the problem here is seems to be casting and performances. Antony Perkins' Norman Bates was shy, vulnerable, amiable and seemingly harmless. Vince Vaughn's version, on the other hand, is sinister, charmless and would have induced any streetwise female guest to jam a chair under her door handle. The problem with Anne Heche isn't so easy to pin down but,for some reason, she just doesn't seem to attain the right mix of vulnerable-female-but-also-scheming-embezzler.Having said all of that, it's worth watching and, as an academic exercise, I'm glad that it was made. It really gives you a whole new appreciation of the subtlety of Alfred Hitchcock's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody seems to be missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to be taking a class in college right now that deals with literary interpretation, and all the different theories of how to go about analyzing language. One theory is called deconstructionism, in which it is stated that language as a whole is slippery and unstable, forever contradicting itself, falling in on itself, and revealing its binary oppositions, the polar opposites of life. Light/dark, happy/sad, etc. In other words, each text, when deconstructed, has not one meaning, not even two meanings. But multiple meanings depending on the reader. Language is always changing, shifting meanings. A kaleidescope of interpretations. The reason I have gone into all this, is because it's very relevant to the study and understanding of why Gus Van Sant decided to remake Hitchcock's classic. Since the 1960s, so much has changed socially, culturally, and in other ways of interpreting situations, people, words, innuendoes. And within an art form such as film, it's very intriguing to explore this dynamic to its potential. And it's something you don't see done very much at all, which is why I believe people were so weirded out by the approach to remake, shot for shot, Psycho, including using the original script. This aspect especially is the most intriguing to observe: same dialogue, same story, same setting, same characters, but DIFFERENT actors, which means altogether different interpretations, different approaches. The best example is Julianne Moore's portrayal of Lila Crane: watch Vera Mile's very good performance, and then turn around and watch Julianne Moore say the same exact lines, but bring to it a whole other attitude sexually, aggressively, even politically. Julianne Moore decided to play her Lila Crane as a lesbian, and even though this was not a significant aspect of her character - at least to the extent of making it verbally known - it is an underlying layer that completely spins the character on its head, reversing its role in the film completely. She's much more aggressive, which actually makes more sense given the things she does once she's at the Bates Motel: peering boldly into the cabin her sister stayed in when Bates is right behind her, going into the Bates house and stepping right into almost guaranteed danger with Norman right upstairs, etc. While Vera Miles did an excellent job, it's not as believable within her interpretation of the character that she would do all those things. With Julianne Moore's bold, sharp, confrontational Lila, it's much more plausible. That is just one example of how the remake of Psycho offers a whole new insight into a classic story, giving it wholly new undertones to today's societal climate. Certain lines that, because of today's poltical correctness, take on whole other context within the scene; the very nature of the character of Marion Crane and her death - in the early 60s it was much more of a shock that a woman would steal, leave her job, to run off, UNMARRIED. But now it's not such a shock, which then leaves the question, is her seemingly punishable death as shocking now? Maybe so. And the masturbation Van Sant added shows the psychology of Norman Bates: as soon as the thrill has left him after orgasm, he's left with the shock and shame that he gave into his desires, which propells him into Mother Mode, killing the object of his forbidden, suppressed desires. These are just some examples of how the remake of Psycho makes perfect and creative sense, and how it should have been much more exciting to artists, who should have realized the thrill in reinterpreting a work of art that takes a great story and gives it whole new meanings. There are so many possibilities within this method, stylistically and story-wise. It just seems to me that most audiences missed the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right Idea, Wrong Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Van Sant was trying to see what happens if you try to make a movie exactly the same, 'shot for shot.' Maybe that might work with some other movies, but not with "Psycho." "Psycho" is famous for changing the course of film history. In 1960, audiences hadn't seen shock slasher murders, a toilet on screen, a key player getting killed early, unwed lovers necking in a cheap hotel room, let alone the extremely bizarre solution to the mystery. This movie had people screaming, fainting and running from the theater in 1960. But by 1998, it was all old hat -- a thriller that doesn't thrill, a shocker that doesn't shock. Anthony Perkins was perhaps the most perfectly cast actor in film history as Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn was doomed and miscast (after many other young actors turned the role down). Anne Heche was off the mark (she ain't workin' no more.) The excellent William H. Macy was miscast -- too wimpy for his part, and wearing an awful "detective's hat." (Overall, the costuming is bad in this movie.) Van Sant's decision to remake Hitchcock's classic black-and-white Gothic in pink-and-orange pastels further ruined the effect. But the bottom line is: 1998 was not 1960. "Psycho," like most classics, is timeless, but of its time. It comes just as the quiet fifties were about to give way to the tumultuous sixties (starting with JFK's assassination). "Psycho" is a historic event. "Psycho 1998" an embarrassing work at the margins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in 98 when it came out and again this week on cable. What was the purpose of making this film? Some others say to make Norman seem more normal than Anthony Perkins was so the viewer would like him more. I just don't buy that. I think it was made to try to appeal to a younger generation, but it failed there also. This movie should have never been made since the original was a masterpiece. What will Hollywood do in the future??? Will they remake classics like the The Godfather or Indian Jones??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant did the only thing he could do in approaching a Hitchcock masterpiece. You just cannot mess with the best. I was quite afraid to see a remake of such a classic until I actually saw it. Vince Vaughn was amazing as Norman Bates. He stayed true to the character while adding his own personality to the role. He is probably one of the most underrated actors of our time. Anne Heche was much better than I suspected as well. For any Psycho fans or even someone who has never seen the original I suggest seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give Gus Van Sant credit when he says, `These are the films that should be remade' as in Psycho is a film that deserves a remake. Though I have to disagree, and I tend to steer towards the, `Why remake something that was originally made so close to perfection?' crowd. Then there's big question number 2. Why remake a film when you're going to shot-by-shot redo everything Hitchcock did and add a handful of things that only Hitchcock-purists are going to notice?And even though everything technically is the same, the '98 remake doesn't quite have the same charm the original has. Maybe that's the `Remakes will suck' mentality (which plagues everyone) speaking, maybe that's the `Who the heck thinks they can match Hitchcock?' mentality-I don't know. This film just feels like it's lacking its own fingerprint, like the cast and crew are trying to be the original cast with that group's interpretation of the script and not themselves and their own interpretation. Like it's trying too hard to copy and not do what the film, itself, needs to do . . . so it feels shallower, the characters not quite as charming, making the plot not quite as interesting.Oh well, as I said at the beginning, I have to give Gus Van Sant credit for trying this, for I don't believe I've ever seen a remake that quite took this approach. Now I can say with confidence that I like remakes that take more liberty. I can also now say I like remakes that take ?okay' films and give it a makeover to help it become a ?good' or even a ?great' film.But the question of how to do a remake will always be the subject of arguments for years to come. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the Hitchcock's version. I didn't even knew that he was the director of the original. I just saw Psycho in the IMDB top250 and downloaded it. Turned out to be the 1998 version. So I watched it without any prejudice at all.It was creepy. It was scary. Several times I really thought about stopping watching it, because it was so scary. :-) I enjoyed every minute and every second of this film. It was simply great.Now to all who whines about this being a lame rip-off. I know how you all feel. I feel the same about recently released The Two Towers compared with the book. I understand that the original Psycho might be infinitely better. May be. But why don't you just forget about the original for a second and rate this new film for what it is. I would give it 8/10 at least. It's an excellent horror movie, without any glaring mistakes. It is truly scary. What more do you want?The characters were believable, the acting was good. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever with it being shot in colour. I think that is ridiculous to claim that just because it is in colour, it is immediately worse than the B/W original. Come on!And once again. Be objective! Or try to be objective. At least pretend to be trying... THIS IS NOT A BAD MOVIE. May be it not the Mona Lisa of movies, but this is a REALLY DAMN GOOD film. The fact that it is a copy doesn't make it bad. The fact that it is a shot by shot remake doesn't make it bad. Judge the film for what it's worth. And this film is worth at least 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people complain that this is a scene-for scene replica. If they truly loved the original they would know that this version is different in virtually every respect.I have seen the original so many times (I own the DVD)and know the dialogue almost word for word. From the appearance of the Universal logo, with Danny Elfman's adaption of Bernard Herrmann's classic score bubbling away I was completely captivated. And then those amazing opening titles! To see them play on a huge screen, in colour with full Dolby sound was thrilling. Yes, they look the same as the original, but not QUITE the same.These are different actors, each giving their own individual interpretations of their roles. Although they SEEM to be saying the same things, they are given a different slant by their intonations. I can't understand the criticism levelled at Vince Vaughn - why must he ape Anthony Perkins? He's more "normal" in appearance, easier to like and therefore more deadly. If I were Janet Leigh, I'd have taken one look at Perkins and climbed right back into my car (remember this film is supposed to take you by surprise).Likewise Anne Heche is fantastic as Marion. It's set in 1998 and Leigh's painful self-consciousness wouldn't play. Heche knows she's committed a crime , but thinks only of getting to her man while she packs her things, blocking out any feelings of shame.I also enjoyed Julianne Moore's fiery Lila, in contrast to the anguished portrayal by Vera Miles. And to round it off, Viggo Mortensen is a personable drugstore cowboy - nothing like John Gavin's stoicism.So what's not to like? It's basically the same tale as the original, and you all love that. Get a grip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first to address the question of "why?" Obviously the businesses involved calculated that they could make a profit. No other reason. I didn't find this as bad or painful as a number of other reviewers have. No, it doesn't approach the original. How could it? I didn't have nearly the problem that others have had with the casting, with one notable exception. Anne Heche was a fairly reasonable '90's Marian Crane. I always thought that Janet Leigh was a bit too much of a cold fish in Hitchcock's film. Heche fleshes out the character in a way that Hitchcock apparently didn't want Leigh to. Perhaps in those days it wasn't wise to get the audience to like a character that gets slaughtered halfway into the film. But the biggest problem with casting this film was Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Sure, he can't play it like Anthony Perkins, but who could? The real problem with him is his size. When he gets angry with Miss Crane, or Sam Loomis, he comes across as threatening, especially to a woman, in a way that Perkins, in his misfit geeky way never was. This makes the main "surprise" of the film much less so, to the detriment of the movie. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was apprehensive about watching this because I don't believe in messing around with the classics. For this reason, I ignored the updated versions of "Sunset Boulevard" and Sgt. Bilko," believing it would be a waste of time to try and top either Gloria Swanson or Phil Silvers in those roles.This "Psycho" was different, however. Actually, "Norman" is the only character that couldn't be convincingly played by any professional character actor. Tony Perkins was so perfectly superb as the geeky nut. Vince Vaughn was OK, but all I could see was a strapping former football player with none of the innocent-appearing innocence Perkins brought to the role.I have to agree with the other critics, though, that it's probably a good idea to recycle these classics and use actors who are currently popular and recognizable. Remember, at one time Clark Gable and Tyrone Power were current and popular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just that, a pointless remake. And also a complete waste of money. I have always felt that Alfred Hitchcock probably rolled over in his grave when this movie was released. I read another comment for this movie telling how it is good to see this movie on the big screen because many people will never have the chance to see it on the big screen. I believe the film makers should have just re-released the original movie so then this film would have never had to be made. I would love to see the original back in theaters. In that same comment, they also say that Vince Vaughn is better in the role than Anthony Perkins. I realize this is an opinion, but still, I believe that is impossible. Though Vince Vaughn is a good actor, he really wasn't acting in the role of Norman Bates. He was pretending to be Anthony Perkins. The way he moves and walks are very similar to the way Perkins moved. So Vince Vaughn isn't playing Norman Bates, he's playing Anthony Perkins playing Norman Bates. Most actors, when they play a character that has already been portrayed by someone else, try to make the character their own. But how could that be done when Perkins played the role to perfection, or at least as close to perfection as one can get. My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's as good as it's unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is there to say about Gus Van Sant's version of "Psycho"? Maybe two things. Obviously it has to be a pretty good film and on the other hand it's definitely an extremely unnecessary one. Only reason (I can't emphasize the word "only" enough) what makes it a good film is the fact that it's such an exact copy of Alfred Hitchcock's classic and therefore it simply can't be bad. This is such a slavish imitation of the original you can't say you hate it without saying something wrong about Hitchcock at the same time.That's an answer to another question: why it's so bloody unnecessary? Gus Van Sant really didn't feel like he has to change a thing. (Well, I can't recall Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates jerking off when he peeked Marion Crane through the hole on the wall but still...) Movie history has never seen such a direct copy of the original. So why bother to shoot precisely the same movie all over again - even if 38 years have passed? That's the big question and I haven't figured the answer out yet, guess I never will.Of course it's slightly interesting to watch a completely familiar film with a completely different cast. First of all I though Vince Vaughn was a bad Norman Bates - not the kind of a supergeek late Perkins was. After a while I had to change my mind - he was actually quite fantastic. Anne Heche was a believable Marion Crane but I didn't care much for Julianne Moore who played her sister. Viggo Mortensen was relatively great as Marion's boyfriend and William H. Macy simply terrific as private detective Arbogast.This isn't so significant anymore but I'm quite a fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers and band's outstanding bassist Flea has a habit of appearing in various movies (The Big Lebowski, Fear and loathing in Las Vegas) and it was kind of fun to spot him out too. But nothing wipes away the most important question: "why?" Maybe it's more simple than I think: this is a remake for people who can't stand old black and white movies. I'll give Van Sant's "Psycho" 5 out of 10 because I got a hard times of deciding what I should actually think of it and 5 is just as close to 1 as it is to 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die-hard Hitchcock fan; when this remake first came out, I studiously ignored it. I recently saw it out of sheer curiosity, and I wish I'd spent my time doing just about anything else. This isn't really a remake; it is a carbon copy (and a poor one at that). Van Sant practically re-shot Hitchcock's film scene-for-scene, camera angle-for-camera angle. He added nothing new to the story, and aside from shooting in color with a different cast, nothing new to the film itself. The result is dreadful; a talented cast is wasted in a film so painfully calculated that there is nothing whatsoever to interest the viewer. The question, then, for both the director and the audience, is WHY BOTHER? Why did Van Sant waste so much time, money, and talent? Why would anyone want to see this dreadful waste of film? It is this kind of directorial self-indulgence that drives up ticket prices by wasting money on films that should simply not have been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this vile and senseless "reenvisionment" of Hitchcock's classic, director Gus Van Sant turns one of the greatest films of all time into a laughable self-mockery. The movie itself is a nearly-frame-by-frame reshoot of the exact same film we saw forty years ago, but this time, its shot in color. Not just color, mind you, but glowing neon pinks and greens and reds that not only make the film look like an old episode of "The Wonderful World of Disney", but also detracts from the eerieness of the film. By glaring at the audience with these gaudy hues, Van Sant manages to present the same exact contents of Hitchcock's monochrome masterwork, but replaces the edgy noir feeling with one of a silly hamboned slasher-film. Did you know that Lila Crane's dress was an audacious shade of charteuse? Hah! The acting is also all second rate, save for Will Macy's role as inspector Arbighast. The majority of the cast might as well be reading from cue cards: there is just no emotion here. Even Vince Vaughn, who received applause for giving Norman Bates an edgier feel comes across as too deadpan, leaving the audience wanting-- and expecting-- more payoff than they ever receive. On top of all this, there are the sexual references thrown in to "modernize" the classic. First of all, why in God's name did the movie need to be modernized? Forty-two years after its original release, it is still by far the best movie in its genre! And if you were going to add something to the film to modernize it did it have to be more sexual inuendo between the young lovers in the opening sequence? Did it have to be longer nude shots of Anne Heche leading up to the shower scene? Did it have to be Norman Bates busying his hands while peeping on his guests?... wll, technically sex wasn't all that was added... there was that rather random shot of a cow during a death sequence. The point is that Hitchcock would be ashamed to see his film defaced in such a way. No, strike that: VAN SANT should be ashamed for defacing Hitchcock's classic. It's sickening. Bottom Line: If you pay money to see this dreadful remake, you are paying too much.</fullReview>

This remake just shows the director and those involved with production have no creativity what so ever. They just ripped off what Hitchcock did. Other remade movies (whether good or bad) have demonstrated some originality, some creativity. This one, obviously doesn't. I don't even see the point of why this movie was made. Why bother go to the theater to see this movie when you could go rent the original or see it on cable?Next is the cast. While I agree that this cast has talent, you can't really seem to find it in this movie. Only Vince Vaughn is any good. He can't come close to Anthony Perkins as Norman, but he is good. His performance was somewhat original and he wasn't trying to copy Anthony.This movie has not been unfairly treated by me or anyone else who did not like it. This remake is a rip off in the truest sense of the term. In closing I'll say this: I would have loved to see the MST gang take a shot at this movie. It would have made for a classic episode of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad can it be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's try a thought experiment to clear our heads a little. Suppose that Van Sant had re-made the original Psycho not just scene for scene but frame for frame. Suppose his remake had been, so far as human eye or ear could tell, IDENTICAL to the original. Would it have been just as good?A stupid question: of course it would have been. Criticising Van Sant's version for being made in 1998 rather than 1960 is like criticising it for being filmed on Mondays rather than Thursdays; the complaint is so entirely beside the point that any attempt at refutation would be equally beside the point. (Of course, making an identical copy of a film that's still around can be criticised on other grounds. It is, for one thing, a complete waste of time and resources, an extravagant waste of millions of dollars worth of time and resources in order to do what a copying machine could do for next to nothing. But this is a separate point. It has nothing to do with the quality of the resulting film.)As it happens Van Sant's version isn't identical to the original. There are many differences. But it has much the same script, exactly the same story, a similar setting, similar camera work, a few affinities of mood and theme. Under the circumstances it's possible, but surely extremely unlikely, for Hitchcock's film to be good while Van Sant's is bad. And no, Van Sant's isn't bad. It's decent enough.So all in all it's surprising how clumsy (compared to the original) it manages to be. Perhaps it isn't surprising. Imagine trying to trace a great pen-and-ink drawing: if you succeed perfectly you produce a work just as good as the first; but you probably won't succeed perfectly; very likely the act of forcing your hands to move the way another's hands have moved will produce something curiously mis-shapen, something SEEMINGLY like the original, but devoid of all life. Van Sant's `Psycho' is like this. The familiar shots - the tracking shot up the staircase, the under-the-chin shot of Norman Bates - are there, but somehow they don't look at all striking. The poor actors, whoever they are, who have been asked to fill in for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins can only produce the most wan performances. (But William H. Macy does a fine job as Arbogast.) Only Bernard Herrmann's music retains any of its force, and IT seems a bit bleached, too.But in addition to sedulously mimicking Van Sant has made some drastic changes, which, strangely, are the worst things he has done. For one thing he's changed the setting. The original was set in 1960. Van Sant, for no obvious reason, changed it to 1998. He might with equal justification have moved the action to 1922, or to Prague. The new setting looks silly, and it makes the film feel at cross purposes with itself. It's like an opera performance where the conductor in the pit is grimly sticking to the letter of the score and the director behind the stage is making hay of the stage directions.Oh, and did you notice that Van Sant's version is in colour? Judging from this and the only other Van Sant film I've seen (`To Die For' - a wretched piece) the man has no flair for colour at all; he serves merely to show how well Hitchcock was served by his decision to film in black and white. I won't comment on Van Sant's decision to interpolate split-second shots of storm clouds between the knife slashes in his shower scene. What could I say? The inanity speaks for itself.Van Sant's `Psycho' is, as I've said, a good film. It's just that the director saw fit to produce a good film in the most perverse way, by taking a great film and weakening it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The must stupid idea in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok first of all is so funny Psycho (1960) is one of the best movies ever and without a doubt the top on the horror list, and now Psycho (1998) is one of the worst movies ever and does not even deserves to be on the horror worst movie list. Why is that you may ask yourself, ok I will tell you the reasons. 1) it is an exact copy of the original not even a remake 2) it is a damn bad copy of the original 3) the acting is the worst in centuries (and normally I really respect Julianne Moore's work) and please someone explain to Vince Vaughn that he does not have to walk like Jason to be a psychotic killer. 4) Gus Van Sant after doing this has lost all the respect a director can have I mean ripping off a master piece to get a lot of money. it is like yeah Sir you are perfectly healthy but I will put you on cirgury couse I want to charge you some big bucks. 5) The shower scene does not have not even the third part of impact as the original (maybe they should use chocolate instead of blood too)Now a lot of people are saying that this copy is good couse it will introduce new film audiences to a great master piece. Well first of all any film lover that has not watched the original does not deserve to call himself a film lover. Second yeah the new audiences will be introduced to the worst piece of crap ever I mean if they wanted to introduce new people to the original master piece why not just remaster it and put it on theaters again like they did with vertigo? that is a brilliant idea this remake is just a stupid one.

		<shortDescription>Good film, but not as good as original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a thoroughly enjoyable shot for shot remake of Hitchcock's classic about the horrors at Bates Motel, and the modern interpretation by director Van Sant was refreshing. Julianne Moore and Viggo Mortenson were good as the boyfriend and the sister, adding some depths to the characters and Anne Heche was convincing as the cash-stealing Marion Crane. The one person who did not convince me was Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. It wasn't Vaughn's fault; he's a good actor. It's just that no one can fill the role like Tony Perkins, it's the role he's famous for. Some interesting alterations (the more graphic shower slaughter, the different-looking mother character) did not go unnoticed, but this was for the most part a replica of the original, even keeping the same score. However, the original is just too classic to ever be topped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's whats wrong with remakes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first of all I'd like to say that yes I thoroughly enjoy the Psycho movies. Yes, you are reading a review from someone who even managed to find something enjoyable in Psycho 2, Psycho 3 and Psycho 4. Originally I wanted to avoid this movie like the plague because of its reputation. Then I saw the sequels and found something enjoyable in all 3 of them and they had the reputation of being crap. So naturally I thought this would be the same. Oh man was I wrong.Now let me explain the biggest problem with this movie. Its not that it was a remake of Hitchcock. Personally I'm fine with remakes as long as they're done well, for example Werner Herzog's interpretation of Nosferatu is a great movie. I enjoy both Nosferatu movies and place both of them as Horror classics and from what I know, I'm not the only one. Gus Van Sant tackled this with the mentality of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" so what we get are almost exact shot replicas except in color, so much so that Joseph Stephano - the screenwriter for the original - gets the credit for writing the script for the remake. If you do that as a filmmaker, people can't help but to judge against the original and when the original is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, you're gonna fail. Yes, you're reading this review right. I actually wouldn't have minded this film if it didn't follow Hitchcock to the letter. Do your own thing, do not cut and paste the script of one of the best movies ever made.The only difference between these scenes are things like, a character wears glasses or carries an umbrella, the angles are different, the technology is updated and the director adds a total of 2 new shots in the entire movie! Thats pretty much the difference between this movie and the original with the exception of actors and its in colour. Oh there is one more thing, the original used rather dark lighting for obvious reasons if your doing a horror movie, this film has some of the brightest lighting I've ever seen. This works against the scenes making any atmosphere in this film (try to imagine) not work.The acting is generally crap. Okay people like Julianne Moore and Viggo Mortesen did okay but Anne Heche doesn't even come close to Janet Leigh and do I really need to point out whats wrong with casting Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? No, I think that actually speaks for itself. Its a shame because I feel as though almost every single actor in this movie is trying but it can't be saved.The thing that amazes me is how forgettable this movie is. All the other Psycho films hold something to marvel at. For example in Psycho 2, it was a movie with a sad message that no matter how much Norman tried, he could not escape his past nor what "Mother" did. Psycho 3 had him battling his personality when he falls in love with a catholic who also has psychological problems who tries to help him out of his psychosis but "Mother" interferes a few too many times for Norman's comfort. In Psycho 4, it went into the deep recesses of what made Norman a killer and how he would deal with his past for good. If this film offered that much originality and effort, it could actually be saved but, as I said not one paragraph earlier, it can't.This movie is a prime example of what happens when a remake sticks too closely to the original and why thats a bad thing. If you're going to remake Psycho, I'm one of those people that would be intrigued by it. But when you remake a movie you want to...remake it, not just reshoot it. Overall if I, a man who saw Psycho 3 and said "there is something well written in this movie" didn't like it, you know thats a bad sign. Do I recommend it? Actually yes. To two particular groups; 1. Practicing filmmakers who want to study how not to do a remake 2. People that say new is always better. Anyone else, avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effort, what's that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so everybody knows the original 1960 movie which is considered to be probably one of the greatest movies of all time. A remake would be tricky to do but not impossible - at least in my opinion. *I know how about we set up everything like the original 1960 movie - hey we can even use the same location and show off now we can do it in colour* *sarcasm*.So as you can see I was not a fan of this movie - I can't even say that much on this movie because if you've seen the original - you'll already know every shot, every line of dialogue, every twist and turn this provides - even Joseph Stefano gets the only screen writing credit.Okay the acting. By god was it terrible! I mean I guess a few people MIGHT have been trying to pull something off but I just have to say something that shows how miscast some of these actors are VINCE VAUGHN AS NORMAN BATES. That's like casting Jim Carey as The Grim Reaper in a remake of The Seventh Seal.The directing of this movie is horrible. I mean I know it's shot for shot Hitchcock's movie but even in the realms of doing that he still does a horrible job. Some of the clothing looks like it was done in the 1960's when it's clearly set in 1998 and when you do find out the twist at the end, seeing Vince Vaughn in drag is one of the most unintentionally hilarious things to be recorded on a camera. And there's the colour grading - it has to be some of the ugliest colour grading ever put on film (EDIT: Seriously? THIS GUY WORKED ON HERO?!). Half the time I think they're trying to scream at you "Hey look we're doing this in colour! Look! Look!! LOOK!!!".So I guess the only way to enjoy this movie is if you have never seen the original Hitchcock movie. My personal recommendation is that you watch the original and only watch this if you have way too much free time on your hands and even then there's about a million better things to do. I mean this is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen, I mean give some of the other ones credit at least they were somewhat trying to do something different, here all the differences are minor and could be counted on one hand. After this I am definitely watching the sequels because from what I have seen at least they're trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Mistake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first stumbled upon this 1998 remake of Psycho on Netflix, I thought to myself cool a fresh modern take on a classic movie, boy was I wrong. I have never been so wrong about a movie in my entire life. The movie is about a girl named Marion who comes into possession of a lot of money. She decides to steal this money from her boss, instead of taking it to the bank, and head to California to be with her boyfriend Sam. Marion decides to pull over and rest for the night at the Bated Motel, but things are soon not what she thought and things get very crazy at the Bates Motel. Everything about this remake is just wrong. From the awful acting, down to the exact shot-by-shot scenes, it even has the exact same dialogue. These things just ruined the movie. It's such a classic movie loved by so many people, I just can't understand why somebody would want to remake this.The first major problem I had with this Psycho remake was the acting. There isn't even a word to describe how awful and off putting it was. Anne Heche, who played Marion, was just an awful choice. She didn't possess the same it factor as Janet Leigh, the original Marion. Wow, and don't even get me started on Vince Vaughn. Whoever decided to put him in this movie as Norman Bates should be fired immediately! He does absolutely nothing for his role. He doesn't bring the same mysterious quality that Anthony Perkins did. One of the things that I liked most about Anthony Perkins' Norman was that he didn't look like a serial killer, he looked like just a normal guy, and Vince Vaughn didn't bring that to the table. All the performances from almost all the character were just really awkward and cringe worthy.Another problem with this movie is that it is an exact carbon copy of the 1960's classic. If you were to play them side by side that would probably match. There are some little changes to the dialogue so that the story would fit into the 1998 year that the remake takes place. Like one for instance is the amount of money that Marion pays for her car at the used car lot. In the original she pays a lot less, but in the remake she pays about a thousand dollars more. Changes like this make sense and are needed to make the movie fit into this year. I just fell that the director could have done so much more with this film than just make a crappy remake of a classic. He should have made it his own. I don't think anybody will ever successfully remake this film, mostly because it is beloved by so many people and nobody can really capture what Hitchcock did with his version of Psycho.I also loves that the classic movie was in black and white. It added mystery and suspense. The remake just lacked all of these things and was really rather boring.All in all I hated this movie. If you want to cut it off within the first five minutes don't feel bad, because I sure did. The acting and the unknown reason to remake a classic movie shot by shot just made this movie so much worse. Skip this remake and watch the 1960 classic version of Psycho, you will not regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistry in cloning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Original? Reverent? Nope! Don't know what Van Sant was thinking, but it was a bad idea... And any differences mentioned really aren't enough to label it a unique re-interpretation, but, given the status of the original, I doubt most would have accepted a new vision anyhow; a big risk either way. However, I have little respect for those merely aiming to make a buck out of a faithful reproduction of the glories of past artists. I've never understood things like Australian Pink Floyd, for example, whose sole purpose is to recreate the all of what other people have done. Imagine, your entire musical and "artistic" career devoted to a precise reproduction of every minute detail of someone else's artistic expression; that's just sad. Sure, for some audiences, it may be a fair replacement for not being able to access/live the original, but honestly, is there any artistry in cloning?This remake, which is nothing more than an attempt to contemporize an ageless and accessible classic (for a buck?), is Van Sant's foray into that 'sad' territory. He's a decent director, for sure, but the whole project was a terrible idea. I'm not amongst those who believe that the original is untouchable, but this version was utterly pointless. Giving it a 4. The idea for this may be as intelligent as creating a bike with no seat, but the execution still deserves a few points as it will no doubt please non-purists and anyone who hasn't seen the original.</fullReview>

The addition to the movie is the thing that gets to me most, masturbation by Bates during the peep hole scene was not in the classic but it was included making in this replica more of a drag.There is nothing to commend on this movie as it was just same as the first, the director and the screenplay writer need to be wiped for just wasting film.This movie is a mockery to everything making movies stand for, and I advise anyone that wants to see Norman Bates, go watch the original.The plot is the same as the original, a secretary (Anne Heche) steals $400,000 from her boss (in the original it was 40,000). While making her escape she lodges in a motel where she meets Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn).Norman has been under the control of his mother for too long and the control seems to have had an effect on him. You want to watch a movie that you will enjoy.Try something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me save you some time. Don't watch this remake if you are a fan of the original Hitchcock masterpiece, "Psycho". In fact, don't watch this movie ever. I had VERY high expectations before viewing this film, and I have never handled my expectations so erroneously in my life.Words can barely express how horrible I thought this film was. I loved the Hitchcock original, and when I heard that the film maker was deciding to use the exact same script (seriously, the EXACT same script) as Hitchcock's masterpiece. I thought it was a novel idea to use the same script, and I couldn't wait to see the darkness that could have been added to a modern remake. The sum total of darkness in the remake is no more creative than adding a masturbation scene, which is comical, It's like the entire film crew and the actors didn't take the film seriously at all.The main reason for my hatred of this remake is because of the INCREDIBLY AWFUL performance of Vince Vaughn's portrayal of Norman Bates. A total debacle and a calamity. At no point did I believe that Vince Vaughn was disturbed or menacing in any way. That's not to say that I compared it side by side to Anthony Perkins in the original. No. Vince Vaughn's performance is totally laughable on its own.The idea of using the same script (which I was curious and excited about at first) works against the film, as it turns out. There is one totally moronic change involving a masturbation scene, and the rest of the film's credibility rests on Vaughn's performance. He fails, as does the director.No vision, no creative direction, INCREDIBLY AWFUL acting and the total lack of a soul, this remake of "Psycho" should be avoided at all costs. ESPECIALLY for fans of the original, but if this were an original film, it would be plenty awful all by itself. Don't waste your time or money. Watch the original only. This remake is a terrible calamity, and Vince Vaughn completely ruins the entire experience with shallow and incredibly wooden acting. The director is completely lacking vision, and the principle photography is extremely disappointing. I really wanted to love this film, but it fell flat on its face. Terrible.</fullReview>

It's all EXACTLY the same, but with worse acting. Oh, and they added stuff. Like sounds of people having sex in the other room to the first scene, and the sound of Bates pleasuring himself in another scene, you know, IMPORTANT STUFF that changes the ENTIRE DYNAMIC of the movie. Oh, and the reveal at the end, 100 times worse than the first. Now, don't get me wrong, I love pretty much EVERY actor in this film, but I guess it just goes to show that you actually have to have something worth shooting, even if you do have good actors. Oh, and all the good CLASSIC scenes they shot, not only did they not better them, they RUINED them by using bad takes and cutting away. Like the pulling down the shower curtain and the car sinking (which is so OBVIOUSLY on a rig it's ridiculous that it's in the film). And Vaughn, I love him, but he tried WAY too hard to make Bates seem odd instead of just letting him be that way. All in all, a HUGE waste, don't get sucked in.

		<shortDescription>Interesting but didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of shooting a near perfect masterpiece shot for shot and using almost the same dialogue certainly made me interested in how it would turn out. Sadly thats all that is interesting here. If you are reading this and have never seen the original - you really must its in a different league to the modern version. I think the problem lies most certainly at Gus Van Sants feet. First of all casting. Janet Leigh was the star of the original movie when it came out so when she dies it is a shock - someone really famous should have been cast as Marion. Anne Heche admitted rather flippantly in the making of that she had never seen the original and only did it to 'work with Gus'. Well this casual attitude to the material shows in her performance. Her character has no redeeming qualities at all and when she is killed you feel nothing. Her version of Marion is lacklustre, lazy and she resorts to pulling faces all the time. At the key point when Marion and Norman eat together there is not point when you think she regrets what she has done. You can see Janet Leigh in the original feeling guilty, that she has made a mistake and she wants to correct this. Heche just reads the lines and leaves. Terrible acting. The two times she did this the most annoyingly was first when the sleazy client of her boss was clearly flirting with her and she was sort of rolling her eyes and when he showed her the 400k her eyes lit up as if to say "don't give me that I'm gonna steal it!". She would never act like that in front of an important client especially if she had been working there 10 years or so its just rank bad acting and direction. Secondly when she is imagining what everyone is saying back at the office as she is driving and the camera focuses on her face she keeps pulling stupid faces like 'this is me thinking now' as if the audience can't work it out for themselves. Julianne Moore: she is a good actress but falls badly here. I agree with Julianne when she says there is not much character with Lila. The problem is the main characters are Marion and Norman, we get to know these over a period of time. Lila comes to solve the mystery and we don't get time to get to know her as much. However Vera Miles still gave Lila some steel and determination without having to turn her into a lesbian. Like only lesbians can be ballsy and determined? Rank bad and again not a very likable character. Vince Vaughan: I liked this version of Norman, he gave Norman a more child like quality- almost a man child which made it his own. Still not as good as Anthony Perkins but he didn't disappoint. The direction is lifted straight from Hitchcock but its in the direction of the actors that Van Sant fails. Too many stupid facial expressions from Heche, lets make Lila a rock loving lesbian and Sam (my god I can't understand a word he's saying.) William H Macy does a good job in a bad hat. Overall worth checking out as a casual interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Criminal on the run, Marion Crane (Anne Heche) takes refuge at the motel operated by Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) - a troubled man whose victims encounter a grisly fate at the hands of his 'mother'. Marion soon becomes the next victim and her disappearance prompts inquiries from her sister (Julianne Moore) and a private investigator (William H. Macy). They both soon discover the morbid bond linking Norman to his mysterious 'mother' at the Bates Motel. Relive the terror in acclaimed director Gus Van Sant's all new version of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense? 'Psycho'," according to the film's official synopsis.NOTE: This is a pale imitation of Hitchcock's original "Psycho" (1960) - you are advised to seek out the original, at all costs. That being said, director Gus Van Sant does Hitchcock justice in that this version includes nothing Hitchcock wouldn't have considered. For example, a line added was from the original's script; and, the more explicit touches (like "Norman" masturbating or "Marion" slumped over the tub) are all things Hitchcock would loved to have included. When censorship relaxed, Hitchcock's films became even more colorfully explicit than the material "added" herein.This version's main strength is the script, by Joseph Stefano; seeing Mr. Vaughn read Mr. Stefano's "Norman Bates" lines makes you appreciate just how much Anthony Perkins brought to his incredibly well-written (and performed) role. Probably, because her part is more minor, Ms. Heche is a trifle more successful. Perhaps, Heche and Vaughn should have been cast as "Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse", instead. If you dare check this film out, you'll also see "Red Hot Chili Pepper" Flea, handsome Chad Everett, a great "Psycho" house set, and William H. Macy's magic hat.**** Psycho (12/4/98) Gus Van Sant ~ Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I can't say I disagree with the critics when they say "Leave it alone". Psycho (along with all other Hitchcock films) is in the forbidden zone as far as remakes go. The only other Hitchcock film to be remade was The Lady Vanishes. It became "Flightplan", which was a fun, action thriller with the "Hitchcockian" suspense. But here's the thing: the setting, plot, and framing were totally different, making it more successful as far as critical praise went. However, Gus Van Sant chose to change absolutely nothing as far as framing, plot, script, and setting, leaving us to ask this: Why? It is exactly the same. Why not make it gorier? Sexier? Scarier? But we know he probably would have gotten poor reviews no matter how much or how little he changed it, since Psycho is untouchable.However, I was surprised by the very, very good acting played by the star cast. They played their parts to the best of their abilities, and it's obvious they were acting to pay tribute to the original actors. Vince Vaughn surprised me. He was a believable psychotic nut-case, and had that look that was almost suspiciously normal. Anne Heche isn't really anything to look at compared to Janet Leigh, but she'll do. I'm sure fans of the original will be glad she's out of the film after 45 minutes. William H. Macy, Viggo Mortensen, and Julianne Moore are great too.But like I said, it was identical frame by frame, and we can't help but compare and call the experiment pointless. If this was the only, original version Psycho, we would love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's some smart way from a director to terminate a company's contract. Maybe it's the stupidest love letter form a student to his master, the biggest tasteless homage ever. Or maybe it's the closest spoof Hitchcock himself would've done out of his own movie! I love to think of it as the ultimate anti-remake that came before the frenzy of let's-remake-movies of the 2000s, to predict it, denude its metamorphosis satirically, and mock abnormally at any other re- makers too ! Anyway, it's terrible, because the repeating, this repeating, serves no one. The whole cast is horrible. (Vince Vaughn) is the last man on earth to be (Norman Bates) of the 1990s, (Anne Heche) is something to refuse, (Julianne Moore) looks too pale and too trivial with no presence. The movie's twist is no twist!! The new clips/old dreams of Hitchcock are nothing novel or important, the colors didn't add anything (so green is Gus Van Sant's color of evil? OK, he needs therapy), even different moves like the zoom-in with moving camera for backward, as in (vertigo), was so naive. The only thing to enjoy here is (Bernard Herrmann)'s music, the mad idea of it for sure as a shot-by-shot remake, and the laugh out of (Vaughn)'s masturbating (honestly, I get a big kick out of it!).Axiomatically, compared to any other Psycho movie (sequels, prequel, parody!) it remains as the dullest and the most lifeless. If it's not Van Sant's way to escape from the studio to his authentic love "the indie cinema" by making a willful fiasco, and if it's not Van Sant's way to identify himself historically as the freakiest Hitchcock's fan ever, and if it's not Van Sant's way to make a bizarre spoof; then, by or against his will, he managed to slap all of Hollywood directors, so himself, on the face, assuring so bitterly that there is no way to remake Hitchcock, and by the practical experiment it's impossible to bring Norman's mom to life, however through the most pungent practical joke I have seen on the screen, and how it looked ultimately like Norman's mom indeed : cold and dead ! Van Sant tried to reincarnate Hitch to prove how that is a horrid monstrous act, and maybe to make us long more for the original ! So the final lesson is : don't remake Hitchcock movies, don't remake movies as they are (a' la Van Sant !), or maybe don't remake movies at all ! I have watched it as a rented video on the night of 31/12/2000, so imagine what kind of Christmas Eve I was having ! I still remember when it first came out at the video store in Egypt. It was written on its cover desperately, and maybe unintentionally disgraceful, "Directed by Alfred Hitchcock" !! To tell you the truth, I think it was way better and so rightful to write "Directed by Norman Bates" !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Sant's Better than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I like Gus Van Sant (Oscar-nominated director of GOOD WILL HUNTING), his 1998 attempt remake PSYCHO was doomed right from the start. If you want to replicate a Da Vinci painting, start with a lesser known one -- don't go right to the Mona Lisa. If Van Sant wanted remake a Hitchcock thriller, he could have tried SHADOW OF DOUBT or SPELLBOUND, two good films but not as widely popular.Van Sant shot the entire film exactly the same as Hitchcock. Not one camera angel askew. Scene after scene was Xeroxed from the original. I think Van Sant added one small, quickly edited masturbation sequence (as Norman Bates spies on Marion Crane through the wall), which I do not remembering appearing in the 1960 classic. So Van Sant must have known that critics were going to compare him to Hitchcock, and to one of the greatest films in the annals of motion picture history. This is why the critics universally panned it. This is why Van Sant won a Razzie Award for "Worst Director" and "Worst Remake or Sequel" in 1999. This being said, I did NOT hate 1998's PSYCHO. I thought Vince Vaughn was incredibly creepy and effective, and there were several very good actors in this movie. This movie was not poorly acted. It was poorly executed and filmed. Van Sant should have either created a new vision for Robert Bloch's novel or passed on the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Psycho is one of my three favourite movies, the other two being The Apartment and Twelve Angry Men. The Apartment has been remade (after a fashion) as Loser, and Twelve Angry Men was remade with Jack Lemmon as juror number eight (Henry Fonda's old role). But Psycho had such a negative response even before anyone had seen it. I like this version because Julianne Moore is a definite improvement on Vera Miles, Viggo Mortensen is a funkier hero than John Gavin (although I do love his Sam Loomis). William H Macy is a really good Arbogast (the inserts during his death scenes are weird but inspired) and the colours are really vivid and exciting. The original, as brilliant as it is, does have stretches of dull moments (it's slightly too long). But that's not too obvious in this version, and I'm not quite sure why, because it's roughly, if not exactly, as long as the original. The only problem I have is Vince Vaughan who is a good actor, but not believable as Norman Bates. In my opinion, Anthony Perkins should have won an Oscar for his performance (even though the same year Jack Lemmon was nominated, but didn't win, for The Apartment, another worthy contender). He is absolutely mesmerising in the original, but unfortunately it did for his career because he was typecast in a lot of inferior roles. Vaughan, though, is too handsome to pull it off. And he doesn't do twitchy so well. But this version isn't the misfire that most people think it is, so give it a chance, although I would recommend the original be seen first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much a remake, more a carbon copy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are remakes, and then there are remakes. At one end of the scale we have something like the Robert de Niro/Sean Penn version of "We're No Angels" which, apart from the title and the fact that both were comedies about escaped convicts, had little in common with the 1954 film of which it was supposedly a remake. And at the other end of the scale we have Gus van Sant's version of "Psycho", which is not so much a remake, more a carbon copy.Most remakes come somewhere in between these two extremes, taking the basic storyline of the original film but giving it a fresh twist and introducing some new ideas. Occasionally the directors and screenwriters of remakes manage to come up with new ideas that work better than those contained in the original film- an example is Martin Scorsese's version of "Cape Fear", which brought a greater complexity and tension to the relationship between Max Cady and Sam Bowden than that found in J Lee Thompson's original. In most cases, however, the remake is no improvement on the original, and very often it is significantly worse.In 1960, Hitchcock's film was considered shocking, partly because the level of violence shown was extremely graphic by the standards of the day. During the sixties, however, censorship was relaxed, and increasing levels of violence became acceptable. By the mid-seventies we were seeing offerings like Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", supposedly based upon the same real-life killings which inspired "Psycho", but far more gory. A remake of "Psycho" therefore seems a pointless exercise. There is no way that a modern version could have the same effect on audiences as the original did on the audiences who saw it in 1960, however many new ideas the director brought to it.Van Sant, however, does not even try to introduce anything new. He keeps the same screenplay and the same Bernard Herrmann score. Scene by scene, shot by shot, his version sticks closely to the original. In places the dialogue is almost word for word the same. Apart from a few cosmetic changes such as increasing the amount of money stolen by Marion from $40,000 to $400,000 to allow for inflation (the action takes place in 1998 rather than the early sixties), the only significant differences are that the new version is made in colour and that different actors are used.Hitchcock said that he used black-and-white to make the film less gory, but in fact his stark photography is far more eerie and frightening than a colour version ever could be. The look of van Sant's film is tame by comparison. He misses some of Hitchcock's symbolism, such as the change in Marion's underwear from white (before the theft) to black (after it), representing her loss of innocence. The bright colours used in this version do not have the same significance.The standard of acting is also below that in Hitchcock's film. Of van Sant's stars, only William H. Macy as Arbogast and Julianne Moore as Lila emerge with any credit, certainly playing their roles as well as Martin Balsam and Vera Miles did in the original. Anyone, however, who thought that John Gavin was wooden as Sam clearly has not seen Viggo Mortensen's interpretation. Janet Leigh could make Marion a sympathetic character despite her crime, but Anne Heche's character is not someone anyone could care about.In Hitchcock's film Bates, with his split personality, symbolises the duality of good and evil in the human soul. Anthony Perkins gave a brilliantly subtle performance making him a polite and inoffensive young man, creepy but not threatening. One of the things that make the film so frightening is that the crimes are committed by a seemingly inoffensive character. Although Vince Vaughn tries to imitate some of Perkins's mannerisms, his performance is far less subtle. His Bates is too obviously potentially violent, a ruffian trying unsuccessfully to hide the ruffianly side of his personality.From what I have seen of his work, van Sant has struck me as something of an overrated film-maker. Both "My Own Private Idaho" and "Good Will Hunting" were praised by the critics, but I found the first turgid and often difficult to follow and the second dull and long-winded, despite a good performance by Robin Williams. His "Psycho" has done nothing to enhance his reputation in my eyes. To attempt a carbon copy of one of the great classics of the cinema is the sign of a woeful lack of ambition. To have made a carbon copy so inferior to the original is the sign of ineptitude. I can only wonder why this film was ever made. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come to this movie with fresh eyes. Read the biography of Ed Gein online. Read the novel by Robert Bloch. Keep your time frame in mind. This movie claims to be 1998, but retains the morality of the early 1960s. Remember the roiling feminism . Think back to the psychedelic colors. Forget you ever saw the original.Then think of the performance of Anne Heche as a nervous, hopeless, getting-to-the-end-of-the-biological-clock Marion, in a boring job in a boring town faced with too much temptation. Her face is already lined and her anorexia becomes a metaphor for emotional and sexual deprivation, with only the occasional meetings at a squalid hotel with her boyfriend Sam to hope for. Watch her as she spirals downward from twitchy to terrified. Her elation at her impulsive act turns to paranoia as her guilty conscience is picked up by the patrolman, her eyes frantically watching the rear view mirror as he trails her. See how the headlights blare on her face and her eyes reach that stage of fatigue where to continue driving would be suicide. See the motherly instinct that Norman unexpectedly elicits turn to alarm by his change in affect.Watch Vince Vaughn as Norman, fleshier, like the original character in the novel, and as would be expected of a muncher of candy corn and white bread sandwiches (but not like the real Ed Gein, who was gaunt). A consumer of pornography accustomed to gaining sexual gratification by his own hand, but with effeminate mannerisms: Ingratiating toward Marion, then infuriated when she suggests a mental hospital for his "mother". Watch him change to the psychotic killer as he rails against the cold eyes and thick clucking tongues in those "places". Places he seems to have been before.William Macy, as Arbogat, gives a reptile-eyed performance as the private detective who proves to be too nosy for his own good. Not a beat is missed here as he follows his leads to their final conclusion. Julianne Moore portrays Leila as a kick-ass feminist hooked up to a Walkman . It gives her a detachment from the sexuality of Marion's boyfriend, Sam. The scene where she and Sam are walking from the motel office and she shrugs off his arm on her shoulder nailed the character. Kicking Norman when he was down was inspired. She never lets us down.Viggo Mortenson as Sam with a cowboy drawl seemed overdone, but since he was supposed to be from The West, it was plausible. His inflection when he asks if Marion's sister looked like her was oily enough to give most women pause. He's gorgeous enough to make a woman who had worked in the same place for 10 years with only the occasional Monday morning tardiness steal to get him. His overreaching familiarity toward Leila upon their first meeting convinces us that our first impression of duplicity might have been correct. His excuses to Mariam were in reality a way to buy more time for freedom.Color is very important psychologically in driving the movie. Red is the color of life and the color of guilt, as in "red-handed". Before the theft of the money, Marion wears a pink suit with her screaming underwear colors hidden, like her desires. She wears red when she decides to leave with the money, and the use of red filters and lights signal anger, guilt, and danger After she is killed and desanguinated, the red fades to the white tiles of the bathroom and the pale lifeless body. Thereafter, except for the cleanup scene where Norman is shown with "blood on his hands" to symbolize his bloodthirstiness, with the mop spreading red blood across the white tiles, and the scene when Leila goes into "mother's" room, which has red curtains to express the rage Norman felt, the colors are all more natural, with the ending shot of a peaceful, isolated paradise like the one Marion thought she was running to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't very happy when they remade Psycho and said it was the same shot for shot. I must say how wrong I was it is actually a very good film maybe not as scary and for sure is not as good as the original but I must say it is still pretty good, and for sure worth watching. The story is the same as the original and is of course pure genius. The screenplay is very similar to the original there are only a couple different parts and surprisingly don't ruin it. The acting is amazing. Vince Vaughn gives a performance so different from anything he has done before, and he gives a performance that shows that he actually does have an emense amount of talent. The others are also pretty good. The direction is good but not any where as good as Gus Van Saint has done before, and is not even a shadow of what Hitchcock did in the original. The visual effects are really good but could have been better. A surprisingly good remake and worth watching even if its not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same as for the original!If you divide a movie into 3 components (acting, sound and "graphic"-that what you see), why should it be worser then the original:-in the first review it says, the sound is the same! -then the graphic, which is far better, because blood is in black &amp; white just a brown or black point on the white surface and that looks idiotic; then every scene when the house on the hill is shown at night there is nothing to see, just the windows, and that is bull... The graphic is in the new version much better, the screenplay is the same!-the acting: in "Psycho" there is one important person, thats Norman Bates (all the others just help to develop his story, and have no really importance), and even if its in both versions nearly the same somehow I prefer Vince Vaughn, he just seems more to fit into the role.To that who say the first movie is a 10/10 and the second a 2/10. Maybe you also believe a document (a Word file for example) is "better" when its on a diskette then on a CD. Thats the completely same insane thing.And, I find it a good idea to make nearly 100% copies of old movies. This would be a possibility to bring also old but good films into the cinemas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The re-make of Psycho was made very poorly. In my opinion, you are wasting your time and money if you see it. The re-make is basically a copy of the original Psycho. I think that the real Psycho was made much better than the re-make. I loved the original. The lines from the re-make are exactly the same as the lines from the original movie. The producer of the re-make was not being very creative. He should have added something else to it or somehow made it better. The Psycho that was made in '98 is just a colorized version of the Psycho made in '60.For these reasons, I gave the re-make of Psycho a rating of 2.The only reason I gave it a 2, instead of a 1, is because the actors did a fairly good job.</fullReview>

What a movie and was I so wrong. This was so good, it really rocked. It was such a good flick, they need another remake - now. Granted, there might have been a few things people felt like they missed from the original. The one thing that pops in my mind was that this rendition had no suspense. Pffft - suspense - really? Who needs suspense? Not me...not any more. I am looking forward to a remake of "The Birds" and maybe "The Man Who Knew Too Much."

Before I saw Vince Vaughn in this film I'v always perceived Vince Vaughn as to before an empty, shallow and hollow actor who could only act as one role which is - himself, but after I saw Vince Vaughn act in this film I now have a completely different view of him for the part he played as Norman Bates being a weird, recluse loner type was so convincing I can now honestly say that in my opinion Vince Vaughn is a remarkable actor.Overall, I'd recommend anybody to watch this film for if you liked the original Psycho film, you'll definitely like this one.</fullReview>

No one can convince me that Vince Vaughn is better at that role than Anthony Perkins. I believe he defined the "psycho" character. Vince did a good job portraying Norman none the less.

Almost every shot, every line, and every scene are the same. I could have directed this movie. As long as the actors in 98 studied those in 60, they would have been fine. Why did the 98 people have to be so lazy. I enjoy that they didn't change the main story line, but they could have added or taken away stuff. They changed nothing, and as a result it would have been better to leave the remake undone. Let's hope they never run out of ideas and have to remake the remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Bad... But Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Psycho" was an outstanding horror film, it was pure excellence - which has me questioning the reason behind the remake. I mean, they remade "Texas Chainsaw", and they remade "The Hills Have Eyes" - but as far as "Psycho" goes, I can't see any even remote improvements they could make from the original film. How can you improve the Hitchock classic? But, if you ignore that fact, then this movie was still fairly decent.It follows the same story as the original - Marion Crane embezzles a bunch of money from her boss. In a panic to leave town, she shacks up for the evening at the remote Bates motel, is killed in the shower by an unknown murderer, and then her sister and boyfriend try to find her with the aid of a detective. I found it interesting that director Gus Van Sant decided to use many of the exact same shots used in the original, same dialog and everything. The new modern-day actors were interesting to watch in a remake of this, in the roles of the film. The acting was pretty good, I will give it that. Anne Heche was a great choice for the updated role of Marion, and Vince Vaughn, while not even slightly resembling Perkins, does a fair job as the mysterious Norman Bates. Julianne Moore and Viggo Mortensen were a good team as Marion's brother and boyfriend, they had good chemistry together. And I enjoyed the updated shower scene, it was a little more brutal and the shots of the rolling clouds was a nice little artistic touch.Bottom line - I'm not saying that this is a completely awful movie. It was well-made and a decent movie. The strong points of the remake are the updated, modern cast, and the fact that it's in color, so the picture is much more vivid and the audience can relate to it more. I can't say it's bad, because it isn't - but my main question is, why remake it? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now watched this twice. The First time i was upset, because everyone told me that it sucks and don't bother watching it, and i sorta disagreed after seeing it. Then I realized that this remake was indeed in fact a replica of the original. The music was awesome, Danny Elfman did a fantastic job with the soundtrack. The camera angles were just like the original, and cinematography was a lot like the original too, so i give them that. The negative aspects are, Norman Bates masturbating while seeing Marion changing. I really don't understand why they did that, it made the movie really perverted at that point. I know its called a peep hole or whatever but none the less I thought they should of had Bates just stare threw the hole and thats it. Another problem, Julliane Moore... from the beginning to the end she didn't fit, neither did Viggo Mortenson. Otherwise the characters were picked pretty well. They followed the story well, added a tad to it, for example, Bates actually fought with Sam at the end of the movie unlike the original, Bates literally fell out of his dress and wig. So Kudos to Van Sant for that addition. Hitchcock had a lot of hidden messages in his version and i thought was genius. Gus Van Sant didn't have anything new that i noticed so, not as good. Two things they should not have changed were the original Psycho house, and the Bates Hotel sign. It just looked dumb and not haunted one bit. The shower scene was better in the first i thought, very clever with the famous chocolate syrup by Hitchcock. Van Sant cant top it I'm sorry, color or not the shower scene was just awkward looking. Now the reason it wasn't that great of a movie, the 1960's movie to us looks cheesy at points, also known as Arbagast falling down the stairs and the stab scene. The new one looks way more cheesier because they're trying to replicate the old one. Just awkward i thought with the new one. Over all i thought it was decent but it will never top the old Psycho and no others probably will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started the remakes craziness that still angers horror fans. Gus Van Sant is the responsible for such madness.I don't know why but there's something about "Psycho" that gets the audience's attention. I made some hypothesis on what kind of audience could this remake have: 1) die hard fans of the original that watch the remake in order to raise their anger and in that way can objectively bash it. 2) newcomers to the genre that haven't watched Hitchcock's masterpiece because it's "old" and dated and prefer the remake because it's in color. 3) Hollywood (mindless) consumers that buy anything. The remake has a great cast, a "popular" director, and it's labeled as the remake of the best horror movie of all time.I watched it because I was angered by it's release. I wanted to bash it but having my facts straight. Now the reasons to bash this are many. First, Hitchcock's memory has been insulted. Anthony Perkins created the Norman character and there's no possible way someone else can give life to it. The way the events are told in the remake is boring, not exciting or suspenful. The FAMOUS shower scene looks like a spoof! But the fact that angers me the most is the director's lack of creativity and hunger for money and recognition. There are some movies that nobody should touch and Psycho is one of them. It's a unique movie, a masterpiece on it's own. The remake was made to make money, not to teach what a great horror movie is to the new generations. Why would someone make the same movie, with the EXACT same camera angles? I can't understand Van Sant's intention but I'm sure that it has to do with money.Those are heavy reasons in my opinion but I'm sure that there are more than I can't think of right now.The acting is quite good. Special mention to Julianne Moore. She's a queen. The movie's mediocrity couldn't harm Moore's reputation.The world knows about Hitchcock's PSYCHO, there was no need for a remake. Thanks God that everybody prefers the original and are aware that the remake is TRASH. 2/10. Julianne Moore makes the movie. That's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT REMAKE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, where to begin...If it isn't hard enough to remake an amazing classic like the original, the director also has to deal with people bad mouthing him for having the audacity to do so in the 1st place. FACT: this movie is based on a novel by Robert Bloch.You can tell Saint took the time to use actors that actually looked like and had the feel of the original actors. Van Saint, in my opinion, also portrayed both cities wonderfully and kept true to Hitchcock's vision in most aspects. The colors were vibrant and also stale; everything obviously was taken into account. Although the original is better, this is a classic remake.** Spoiler alert! **I read some reviews here and noticed that a lot of people were really offended by this movie. Gus Van Saint flashing those two disturbing images while William H. Macy's character is being stabbed is amazing. If you do not find that to be true to the artistry that Hitchcock brought to the original, something is wrong with you?or maybe something's wrong with me ?..Either way I found this movie to be a great remake and worth buying. Even if it means you have to eat from the dollar menu that day... it's still worth it!7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel this movie hasn't gotten the recognition that it deserves. The only good thing about the original psycho was Anthony Perkins. The rest of the characters were horribly acted and the quality was less than satisfactory. however, in the new one, I found the acting to be brilliant. Anne Heche is one of the best actresses of the time, and Julianne Moore and William H. Macy also surprised me with their acting quality. True, Vince Vhaugn was no Perkins, but he gave a decent attempt. The directing and the camera work was excellent. I couldn't have asked for a better re-make of the not-so-good original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho is an entertaining improvement of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the new Psycho was so much better than the old Psycho. I had watched this version in the theaters before the original and maybe that is why I appreciate this version so much better. i had heard so much about the original Psycho and I decided that if this is the "same" version as the original, then it should be just as good if not better. This version was in color and Anne Hech and Vince were wonderful. Anne played the part of a little, frightened confused sexual lady well. She had the nervousness in her voice and she seemed innocent, insecure, and gawky in her performance. She fit the role that was to be Marion Crane, not the role of Janet Leigh. I thought Anne was much more distinct in her voice where as Janet showed less emotion and fright in her voice. The tension and nervousness in Anne was surprisingly clear and she spoke with much more passion than that boring other. Vince was more muscular, goofey, funny, and very ogre like. Yet Vine yet the darker face, the more threatening built, the louder voice and he showed much more character that that skinny, monotone Perkins. Vince also seemed more scarier when he interrogated Anne about the mad house and Mom and his screams of guilt(after shower) were extremely convincing and emotional. Julianne Moore in the role of Vera had more character and reminded me of the red head from the x-Files. She definetely fit the detective role and her red hair, her conviction in voice, and her vibrant color was so much better than the "master's" version. After seeing this in the theater, I was not thrilled about it, but I overall thought it was good, not great. However, talk of the Old Psycho still lingered and I decided to rent the movie myself. The color, the actors' performances were dry and boring. The Detective in the new version is ten times better than in the Old version. The color(new version) is what really made the difference and the sets such as the birds, and the blood were so much more grander and entertaining. When I watched the old version (i was so bored, even by shower sequence) that I couldn't resist to barf at this "classic". The people of today's age cannot find real appreciation in "horror" movies like the old Psycho. It is not thrilling, the sets are not as good, there is no color, and the actor in the Old version are less emotional and more "old". If you want to see Psycho, see the new version. If not, rent movies like Carrie(Depalma's best), or Halloween(Carpenter's best) for the real entertainment.</fullReview>

IT LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION WITH ME, AND, MY GIRLFRIEND SUFFERED THE SAME MALADY SO MANY WOMEN SUFFERED AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE; BEING UNABLE TO TAKE A SHOWER UNLESS THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE. WHAT SETS THE ORIGINAL ABOVE ALL THE OTHER CHEAP IMITATIONS WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED, BESIDES THE GENIUS OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK, IS THE UNBEARABLE, HEART-STOPPING, GUT WRENCHING TENSION. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AT A TIME WHEN THE SUBJECT OF DUAL PERSONALITIES WAS STILL IN THE RESEARCH STAGE, AND THE ONLY EXPOSURE THE MOVIE-GOING PUBLIC HAD WAS THE HIGHLY ACCLAIMED ''THREE FACES OF EVE.'' IN THIS MOVIE THE SCHIZOPHRENIC WAS PORTRAYED AS A SYMPATHETIC VICTIM. IN 1961, WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE, NO ONE EVEN CONSIDERED NORMAN AS THE MURDERER. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS ''MOTHER'' AND NORMAN WAS JUST BEING THE DUTIFUL SON IN COVERING UP HIS MOTHERS OUTRAGES. THAT IS WHY THIS MOVIE CAN BE WATCHED ONLY ONCE. AFTER VIEWING THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL, THERE CAN BE NO SUSPENSE, NO TERROR, NO TENSION. I DECIDED TO SEE THE REMAKE AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT, AND IT WAS VERY TAME, SIMPLY BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.THERE'S ONLY ONE MONA LISA, ONLY ONE EIFFEL TOWER, AND ONLY ONE DODGER STADIUM.

So when the Director Decided to do this an Enormous, Aloof, and Unthinking Damage was done. Younger Movie Fans are Likely to be drawn to this just because it is New, in Color, and has Modern Day Recognizable Stars, Never having seen the Hitchcock Classic from 1960.

		<fullReview>Marion Crane steals $400,000 from her boss, she runs away and on the road she stays in the small Bates Motel, owned by psycho Norman Bates?..I have watched this week both the original 1960 and the 1998 remake for the first time.The original psycho is overrated. The remake is stuck to the original ideas but add some surrealistic colour and own interpretations. Anthony Perkins did a great job, but the rest of the characters were horribly acted. The remake had a great cast. The actors create different characters ,even using the same lines, and bring more depth to their roles, particularly Anne Heche. The remake has improved acting, the score in digital sound and more realistic sound effects. The movie is still a little too slow? It could have used some pace.The original is a pretty fine movie (since it was made in 1960), the remake is slightly better, with a few more adjustments it could have been a masterpiece?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** possible small spoilers ***to put it frankly: this might just be the dumbest movie i have ever seen. only recently did i see the original version of 'psycho' (hitchcock, 1960) for the first time and even though it wasn't nowhere near the perfection of, say, the masterpiece that is 'vertigo' (1958) it was a great movie - excellent hitchcock'ish work with the script giving the viewer small hints all through the movie, having us believe the story is about something that just turns out not to be of any importance at all, great camera work, magnificent acting and a haunting musical score summed up to a very memorable movie. there is little doubt why it became a classic and is regarded one of milestones in American cinema.and then there's this remake by gus vant sant from 1998 that just remains a mystery to me. all through the movie i sat and tried to figure out if it was a homage to his childhood idol or if it was a bad parody - based on the EXACT same plot with the actors making (or: trying to) the EXACT same facial expressions and saying the EXACT same words it remains unclear why this movie was made at all. it brings absolutely nothing new to the film at all, it is just an extremely bad remake; the actors are merely distorted images of the original performances - exactly the same, just worse. the camera work is nice, but boring compared to hitchcock's (that was filmed 38 years earlier!) and the subtle horror and special feel surrounding the 1960 version just seem to have disappeared completely. but hey! it is in color! oh, oh no, that doesn't work as well as the black and white play with shadows and lighting either. bottom line: watch the great original version of 'psycho' or don't watch it at all.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, no doubt, but what is the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Psycho" is not a bad movie. "Psycho" isn't even a bad remake. To say it is unfaithful to the original is like saying George Lucas' recent installments in the "Star Wars" movies have an ounce of creativity in them. It just comes down to one question: Why? Why make a scene-for-scene remake (literally!) of the 1960 classic, when people can simply watch the 1960 classic itself? To dupe stoned teens into seeing something modern while they are unknowingly watching a replicant of an earlier film? Do the filmmakers want these teens to come out of the theater with a newfound knowledge of essential cinema? I think not. If so, they would have had the smarts to film it in black and white, and make it more of a brother to the original than a disowned son.I think it is simple: As many films' remakes are extraordinary, others are not, and "Psycho" tries to be that one-in-a-million special remake. I think that the filmmakers wanted to also pay an homage to Alfred Hitchcock: For what other reason would they shoot every scene exactly the same? Save the glimpse of Norman masturbating while watching his guest strip down (which happens for about two seconds), and some extended nudity and focuses on Bates' mother in the infamous Shower Scene, it is all the same. Even the camera techniques, such as when the PI walks up the stairs of the Bates residence and is slashed to death by a crazy old woman. There are, of course, small things such as facial expressions that differ, but if you think that I'm being humorous I am not. Maybe the keen observer will notice that certain things are not focused the same way, such as the stuffed birds in Norman's office--they are out of focus, softer, and not as sharp. We don't get a sense of paranoia, fear, or the feeling that we are being watched by dozens of small eyes. The film is just not as sharp, dark, scary, freaky or filled with paranoia. It is more of a soft "Psycho," which is odd since the film is often more gory than its father.Gus Van Sant seems to have the purpose and the desire to make a good remake here, but when we know what is going to happen already, we want something knew. There is no sense of unknowing, no sense of fear. We know what is going to happen. This would have been the great chance to provide some more gritty detail into the tale, to modernize things. Of course, if the film had been made this way, no doubt people would have complained it was too different. It's a catch twenty-two. And Alfred Hitchcock is a much better director than Gus Van Sant. It is easy to mimic another film exactly. It is like a toddler mimicking its parents: If you stuff a toddler in a room by himself, the chances he will pronounce "Momma" perfectly will be much smaller than the chance of putting speaking parents in the room with that toddler. Gus Van Sant is the toddler, and Alfred Hitchcock is in that room with him, feeding him the words. All Van Sant has to do is mimic them.Another of the film's flaws is the casting of Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn just isn't freaky enough, or scary enough. Anthony Perkins always gave me a sense that he was a lonely man inside a wretched soul. He was insecure, and he made the audience feel that if we were in that motel room with him, we'd feel pretty uncomfortable, too, just like Janet Leigh's character was in the 1960 version. Norman's laugh doesn't have enough insecurity in it. When Perkins laughed, it made us feel as if he was nervous to do so, as if he expected to be picked apart for laughing at the wrong thing. When Vaughn laughs, it's more of a giddy laugh, an airhead's laugh as opposed to a maniac's.It all comes down to the fact that though "Psycho" is a good film, and a faithful remake, it has no specific purpose. Why would any audience want to watch a scene-for-scene remake of a much, much better film, when they can simply watch the much, much better film? You tell me.And as the credits role, notice the "thanks to John Woo for his kitchen knife." Needless to say, John Woo's kitchen knife isn't going to be worth as much as the one used in the original. 3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marion Crane (Anne Heche) is your typical worker from Arizona who just took some important money from her boss as he runs away with it. As she travels, she stops by the Bates motel ran by the strange Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) who has a deranged mother by his side at the house across by the motel. Marion meets her fate over there and the authorities including her sister (Julian Moore) begins to investigate.WHY IN THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY, WHY? I mean why try to mess with perfection? MONEY, that's right! nothing but money. A true completely unnecessary and unwanted remake of a timeless horror thriller classic from Alfred Hitchcock and done for people who refuse to see B&amp;W movies. Gus Van Sant who is a good director managed to do this remake for a paycheck instead for art and the film co-stars William H. Macy and Viggo Morgenstein.There's nothing new here in this so-called "remake" of a classic, it's just shot-to-shot, frame-by-frame, word-by-word and score-to-score colored imitation of one of the greatest movies ever made. Only except miscasted new actors thrown in with a couple of different things in this movie, it's a pure disaster that was doomed from the start. Now remakes of the horror genre don't always suck like take for instance "The Thing", "The Fly", "The Blob", "Dawn of the Dead", "The Crazies", "The Hills Have Eyes", "Cape Fear", Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with some others were all actually well done and brilliant remakes all done right as they weren't doing it for cash like this one. Even Rob Zombie's "Halloween" was far better than this imitation as it did something different to the source even though like "Psycho (1998)" it wasn't necessary but it was enjoyable as it's own "Halloween" movie.Van Sant's "Psycho" on the other hand is a soulless excuse to make a profit but i am glad it failed at the box-office for people knew not to screw with a classic.Bottom line: If it ain't broke don't fix it! watch "Psycho" from Hitchock instead of this worthless piece of crap, i think this movie along with "The Wicker Man" are the two worst remakes ever whether in horror or regular film genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the movie is brilliant. I thought the first version was brilliant, too. not so much for the impressive technical feats like the opening shot or the shower scene, as the surprise twist of the plot which sets the audience up for one plotline and star and then throws them out for a totally different story and set of characters. Of course that only works the first time you see the movie. What makes this version exceptional is that it goes beyond the normal contexts of film entirely. It isn't about Marion Crane or Norman Bates or a robbery or a gratuitous murder at all. It's about having seen &amp; analyzed &amp; deconstructed Psycho to death, until every last one of us is the definitive film critic who knows the exact number of setups in the shower scene. This film completely voids film "criticism". In no way is this movie a "remake" - it's a deliberate impersonation of Psycho, much in the same spirit as Cindy Sherman's impersonations in her photographs. A welcome breakthrough.</fullReview>

It was made shot for shot like the original (meaning it has the EXACT same camera angles and shot durations as the original), though it did have a few extra parts... of course needed to sell it to a 90's audience. One such scene is when Norman Bates is... how shall i put this... flogging his dolphin through a peep-hole right before the shower scene. Not too tasteful, but oh well. If this movie didn't have Vince Vaughn in it (who is an awesome actor), then I think the movie wouldn't have made a penny, except from fans of the original (but I seriously doubt that TOO MANY fans of the original would have gone to see it).

It is a waste of time if there ever has been. Mainly because if you have seen the original Psycho, you'll find all you need. This time though, director Gus Van Sant brings the EXACT same picture to the screen (except with different actors, color and a few sick differences) and with the color comes less effectivness. Sant should be ashamed of himself to try and get money by just practically re-releasing Psycho by just doing it himself. Hitchcock proved his genius with this film in 1960 and it became one of the most brilliant suspense film of all time. This is just money, time and talent waster. F (lowest rating)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Waste of Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time on this poorly made sequel! The original Psycho stands the test of time and didn't need to be remade, but we wanted to give this one a chance, since we are big fans of the new TV show Bates Motel. We hung in there after being bored for the first 15-20 minutes, hoping the movie would eventually pick up steam. Vince Vaughan does not convincingly pull off the role of unbalanced Norman Bates and neither does Anne Heche play the role of the female victim well. The only redeeming quality of this movie is a cameo by William H. Macy. The murder scenes were also interestingly directed with a dream-like, time lapse quality. Otherwise, with bad acting and a plodding storyline, it's just bad all around. Maybe I'm being too generous with 2 stars...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching it! I thought that the remake was fantastic, obviously not as good as the original. But it was great for a remake. They were line for line correct and the details were very precise. i was surprised at the ratings and reviews because this was such a great movie.Vince Vaughn was a great Norman Bates. HE was no Anthony Perkins, but he was a fantastic psycho. Yes, there were clearly some changes (such as money stolen $40,000 to $400,000) and some of the effects were fake. But that's no reason to hate on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrongfully maligned for a decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Psycho" is a largely maligned film for offenses that it shouldn't be criticized for.**SPOILERS**Desperate to get away, secretary Marion Crane, (Anne Heche) goes away for the weekend with several thousand dollars in stolen money and flees into the Arizona desert. When a driving thunderstorm forces her to stop off at a roadside motel run by Norman Bates, (Vince Vaughn) and his abusive, never-seen Mother, she begins to get uncomfortable around him and eventually decides to head in early. When she mysteriously disappears from the motel a day later, her sister Lila Crane, (Julianne Moore) and boyfriend Sam Loomis, (Viggo Mortensen) go looking for her. Hearing that she had stopped off at the motel and disappeared, they arrive hoping to get some answers. When they do some snooping and finally get some answers, they struggle to believe what they find and gt away alive.The Good News: This is a severely underrated film. The cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of the absolute best examples of this is the death of the detective. As he calmly walks up a set of stairs to investigate strange noises, we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony, unseen. He reaches the top of the stairs, and then the killer walks out and repeatedly stabs him, which causes him to fall down the stairs. This is so special in that the way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in your mind. This also adds in several more stabs and more blood to the scene, making it just that much more violent than it was remembered and sticks out just fine. The shower scene in here is just as great as before, keeping the same style as before but giving it an extra dose with some much-needed blood and gore in the shot that still packs a punch. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. The relationship between Norman and his mother, especially when he is talking with Marion about her, the very first time we know of her, is one of the creepiest scenes ever filmed. You can tell that the way he's saying things and how he's saying them, you know something is off, and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character. The most radical changes made are to bring out something much more overtly sexual in the material. We get a brief side glimpse when the first victim as she undresses for the shower and a brief rear shot as she keels over dead. There are sounds of panting from neighboring rooms on the soundtrack in the motel room tryst that opens the film and the client with the stolen money is more overtly flirtatious. The visit to Norman's room shows a stash of pornography, yet the most radical change is having Norman clearly heard to be masturbating as he peeps at her undressing in the shower. This is nicely sleazy and sets up the scene even more than before. The ending revelation is a little more creepy and intense and does work just as well as before, especially as the decrepitness of it comes across a little more clearly. All in all, this isn't a useless film as has so often been criticized.The Bad News: There isn't all that much in here that is actually wrong. The addition of color really works against the film. It bleeds out all of the stark, atmospheric effectiveness the original had. The depiction of ordinary Arizona desert landscape here lacks any of the same alienating effectiveness that the black-and-white photography lent to the original. Similarly so the black-and-white made low angle shots up on Norman Bates framed by his stuffed birds seem to eerily foreshadow something sinister, but the color robs the shots of any atmosphere. Without black-and-white, the house up on the hill loses some of its looming, foreboding Gothic ominousness. Another big stumbling block is it's constant ability to take the viewer out of the film with obscure phrases and sayings. While it's set in the present, much of the dialog sounds out of place considering its antiquated vocabulary and delivery. As it is mostly left intact from the original, to keep many of that era's euphemisms and habits in the modern time period is hugely distracting, especially when it does manage to update the events a little. It bounces back-and-forth on numerous occasions, making it all the more obvious when it's done. The other big problem is that, at times, the pacing is off, which is a problem from the first one. There's no need for there to be untold minutes here worrying about cleaning up the dirty room or the distraction in the shack. They take a while to get going, and this really could've taken several scenes out without doing any harm to the film. Otherwise, this one wasn't as bad as it really could've been.The Final Verdict: As most of what's been said about it is that it desecrates a classic, look at it objectively and it's still a good update of a great film. Ignore there's been a first one and you just might find yourself enjoying it, and the curious are also advised to take a look, but if you can't forgive what's been done, then there's no use seeing this one anyway.Rated R: Violence, Nudity and off-screen sounds of masturbation</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho:the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I add that hasn't already been said. It's easy to criticize Van Sant for his direction, but pretty much anyone sitting in the director's chair calling the shots wouldn't have been able to successfully pulled it off. I think the decision to remake that film was a hasty, not-well-thought-out idea.The first time I watched the film, it didn't trouble me as much as tonight's viewing because it's so easy to see that this whole remake was a bad idea. Vaughn just doesn't have that ability Perkins has..not many, if any, do. Heche as Marion is merely a casualty of bad dress(who ever fashioned Heche must've had a grudge against her). Poor Viggo just looks plum out-of-place and silly in his cowboy-dress as Sam Loomis. William H scores in his role as nosy Arbogast who gets so close to the truth it costs him his life. Julianne Moore, who carries a back-pack and walkman for Petesake, is the representative liberal modern gal full of cynicism and bitterness..it's hard to watch her stuck in this parody of a role(..although, certain shots show her beauty). Many of the shot-for-shot scenes pretty much copying Hitch's style makes the whole film seem but like a waste of time. Even worse is when Van Sant tries to put his stamp on the film in awkward little images during key moments(such as the infamous shower sequence and the unveiling of mother).One complaint that didn't bother me too much(..well, actually a tiny bit)was the flick being shot in color, although Van Sant's use of color is odd, especially in how the Bates Motel looks as well as Bates Mansion. Wardrobe seems to be aimed as a joke, although I'm never sure if it's intentional or not.The shower sequence remains pretty much the same instead it's real blood in the tub this time. I did like one image as Van Sant's camera closes in on Marion's eye as it loses life(..although the shot of the cloudy sky is bonkers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film could have been a lot better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Credit where credit is due the actors played their parts superbly. Vince Vaughn's take on Bates is unique and portrays the psychopath of 90's. The other characters are fleshed out by the new cast and are given a life they didn't achieve in the taught suspenseful psychological thriller that is Hitchcock's masterpiece. The additions of modern elements to the story also add to this version.This film however tries too hard to remain faithful to the original and be new and fresh at the same time. The point of a good remake is to update the story, improve upon the original and make a film that appeals to a modern audience. The obvious difference that a remake of Psycho would have is colour. Improvement? Not really as Van Sant's hits you with a barrage of psychedelic 60's colours, that not only make this film look computer coloured, but also make it immediately look dated. The look of the sets also adds to this with furniture that looks antique. Why set the film in the present, update dialogue and acting just to lock it into the time period when the original was made. This also contradicts the Bates motel sign, which states newly renovated.One major change that was unnecessary was the house. The house itself is a character in the film. The creepy old house has been scraped in favour of a house devoid of character, and that is completely the same shape on the inside as the original anyway. Gus Van Sant would have been better off painting the original house if he wanted it to look new. Also the Bates character while played certainly differently has lost its edge and is an unwelcome change. The only person that has played Norman Bates anything resembling Anthony Perkins is Henry Thomas who plays a young Norman Bates in Psycho IV.Imagine the same Psycho remake but set in the 60's, with the original house and sets, and with Henry Thomas playing the geeky Norman bates. That movie could then tie in with the excellent Psycho II and not bad Psycho III and the back-story of Norman Bates that is Psycho IV. That would have been more of a homage to the original and Perkins instead of the flawed experiment it turned out to be.Hell you could have even just cut Perkins out of the original and added a splash of colour to him and put him in this version or cut new actors into the original or just colourized the original, that would have been more of an experiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still can't quite understand why Gus Van Sant followed up "Good Will Hunting" with a "Psycho" remake. Just because he could? Granted, it was a worthy effort. But they don't really make use of the techniques that made the original so great (such as shadows and facial expressions). And besides, everyone knows what happens.As for the cast, it's got Vince Vaughn as Norman, Anne Heche as Marion, Julianne Moore as Lila, Viggo Mortensen as Sam, William H. Macy as Arbogast, James LeGros as Charlie, Robert Forster as Dr. Simon, Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Chambers, Chad Everett as Tom, Rance Howard as Mr. Lowery, and Rita Wilson as Caroline. As a joke, I'll translate that with respect to their famous personas: one of the Wedding Crashers, Ellen DeGeneres's ex, the world's most serious actress, Aragorn, Jerry Lundegaard, a character actor, the "Jackie Brown" guy, the old guy from Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, the '50s heartthrob, Opie's dad, and Tom Hanks's wife.All in all, nothing special, but worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Great Remade Horror Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this movie I debated on if I should rent the original or the remake, and I thought the remake would be more my cup of tea. I watched this movie, and it scared the heck out of me. Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, Anne Heche, William H. Macy, and Viggo Mortensen were all great in the movie. This movie is about Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), who owns the small Bates Motel in the middle of Arizona with his crazy mother (or so we think) in a creepy house at the top of a hill next to the motel. When Marion Crane (Anne Heche) arrives at the Bates Motel after stealing $400,000, she gets a cabin, and now she has vanished. Now, her sister Lila (Julianne Moore) and Marion's boyfriend along with Detective Arbogast (William H. Macy) must find what happened to Marion even if it means unleashing the terror at the Bates Motel. This movie is very fun to watch, and is surely creepy in it's own way. I also liked the way they gave it that classical horror feeling. Gus Van Sant was so great at directing the movie, as well as he did a great job in directing Good Will Hunting. This is a great horror remake. I give Psycho a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The end credits proudly proclaim "In the memory of Alfred Hitchcock", but anyone who sees this will know that the great cinema master was rolling around in his grave back in 1998.The film is, basically, a frame for frame copy of the first. However, it never gets over it's outstanding question; "why?". Why was this film made? There's nothing that could be added to Hitchcock's amazing original, and it doesn't even need an update, that's the thing; Psycho more than holds it's own against the horror-thrillers of today.As I've established; this film is pointless and shouldn't have been made, but ignoring that fact; let's look at the film itself.The remake does actually feature a fairly nice cast. Three of them, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Phillip Baker Hall seem to have took time off from the shoot of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" to make this movie, which is no bad thing as they can all act. The only problem is, mostly with Macy and Moore; they just don't look right in the film. Speaking of people that don't look right, Vince Vaughn springs to mind. It's hard to follow someone like Anthony Perkins, a man that made the title role his own; but Vaughn doesn't even give a respectable performance. Perkins portrayed the character as a naive young man, but one who has a definite atmosphere of malice about him; Vaughn only succeeds in looking silly. Viggo Mortensen has a small and noteless pre-Lord of the Rings role in the film. His character is small, but he fails to make any impression anyway and finally; Robert Forster, a man that is best known for his role in Jackie Brown, is decent in his bit part as the psychiatrist analysing Norman; the same one that many people think was misplaced in the original film.The film itself is fairly well shot but, maybe because it's in colour, it gives the impression of being too modern compared the original, and it suffers a loss in charm because of that. Gus Van Sant takes the directors chair and does a good job, but then again; that's not hard when all you're doing is copying a master. The story is good, but that is, obviously, to the credit of the original.Overall, as a film; it's not great and as a remake of a classic movie, it's pointless and a waste of time and therefore should not be viewed by anyone.</fullReview>

This movie was one of the scariest I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of horror movies. I think this movie is heavily under-rated, and that you should watch it yourself before judging it.

		<fullReview>Psycho opens to some on screen captions that say 'Phoenix, Arizona December the eleventh 1998 two forty-three P.M.' &amp; cool looking shot which pans &amp; zooms across the city &amp; directly into a hotel room window where Marion Crane (Anne Heche) &amp; her deeply in debt lover Samuel Loomis (Viggo Mortensen, who starred in another Hitchcock remake The Perfect Murder (1998) the same year) are talking in bed, they talk about starting a new life together but Sam needs money to clear debts. Marion arrives at work for the day &amp; a client named Tom Cassidy (Chad Everett) gives her boss Mr. Lowery (Rance Howard) $400,000 in cash who in turn gives it to Marion to deposit in the bank. On her way to the bank Marion can't help but think that this $400,000 would solve hers &amp; Sams problems &amp; help them start fresh so she decides to steal the money. While on her way to tell Sam Marion buys a new car &amp; stops off at an old motel, the 'Bates Motel'. There she meets the owner, one Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), Marion is given room No. 1 &amp; befriends Norman who offers her dinner. Later that night as Marion takes a shower she is stabbed to death. People in Phoenix start to miss her, Sam, her sister Lila (Julianne Moore) &amp; Mr. Lowery who hires a private detective named Milton Arbogast (William H. Macy) to track her down &amp; discover the truth...The much maligned $20,000,000 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) was co-produced &amp; directed by Gus Van Sant &amp; I actually quite liked it, I didn't think it was a masterpiece but it provided 100 odd minutes of entertainment &amp; that's all I ever ask for. I should also say at this point that as of now I have never seen Hitchcock's original (there are some of us!) so I simply can't compare the two. The script by Joseph Stefano based on the novel by Robert Bloch is a little slow at times but it tells an effective story &amp; tells it in an entertaining way. I love the idea of killing of your lead actress half way through the film, most audiences just won't be expecting it. The characters are likable enough &amp; I thought the twist ending worked well. On the negative side we don't really need a supposed shot-for-shot (or so I've heard) remake do we? Psycho is also a little pedestrian at times &amp; maybe it's a bit easy to see where it's going. It's a dialogue driven film rather than action so don't expect lots of deaths or gunfights either. Director Van Sant does a good job here even if it has the look of a bland somewhat forgettable Hollywood production at times. The production design is interesting as it apparently depicts 1998 but feels almost period at times, I'm sure this was intentional but the look of Psycho feels somewhere between '98 &amp; '60 which I rather liked. The famous shower murder is pretty cool but don't expect buckets of blood, there is only one other murder besides this so don't expect a big body count. The acting is fine from all involved especially William H. Macy who is great at playing likable, laid-back characters isn't he? Overall I liked Psycho, it isn't the best film I've ever seen but it's far from the worst no matter what anyone might say, especially on the IMDb where it seems almost every film has been described as 'worst film ever' at some point. Definitely worth a watch particularly if you haven't seen the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was one half genius and one half hack. The original is awful with the exception of a few brilliant scenes -- especially the end in the fruit cellar.The movie is not unlike "The Birds" it is so pathetic sometimes that you would think it was directed by a total idiot. But then Hitchcock did not work with a pool of talent in regards to acting -- most of them were still doing the over dramatic, completely unbelievable garbage that wasn't really shed until Newman and Brando came into the lime light: when people saw it was better to act "REAL" than to put on a fake voice and dramatic gestures.All in all, I think Van Sant was just conducting an experiment. He created a scene by scene clone of the original, although the acting is better in his version.I agree, there was no real 'point', but it was still better than most of the garbage that floats around -- look at 'Hostel' for the love of the lord. That was the worst movie ever made and it got popular and critical attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of a remake that is inferior in EVERY possible way to its original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say that I love the original movie, then again I love Hitchcock. This remake on hearing about it didn't seem too bad; I mean it has a talented cast, a good director and promised to be faithful to the original plot. So what did go wrong? By the way this review has no intention of offending those who love this movie, but in my mind this was not a good movie.I'll tell you what went wrong(for me that is). Everything! This is a perfect example like I've said already of a remake that is inferior in every possible way to the classic original. It is a remake, minus the terror and suspense of the original, and came across as pointless, even more pointless than the remake of the Wicker Man. I know it is thought as unfair to compare originals to its sequels/remakes, but I feel that I need to compare to show how inferior it was to the Hitchcock.Gus Van Sant... he is a good director, however every scene in the film lack suspense and consequently the whole film came across as bland and lifeless. Plus it is way too stagey. The cinematography was rather jerky and rushed in places, and the lighting is too bright for a very dark and murderous tale. The black and white cinematography was perfect in capturing the creepy mood in the original Psycho. The script was clunky at best, and the murder sequences that were so traumatising in the original are so badly botched thanks to the redundant flash flames.The acting was very poor. I don't love Vince Vaughan and I don't hate him. I just like him, but it is fair to say it is dependent on the film. Vaughan is simply not creepy enough as Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins's performance was phenomenal, with his face, his voice and his mannerisms it was one of the most chilling performances of all time. However Vaughan plays the character like an effeminate hunk and is very monotonic throughout... talk about wasted talent. Anne Heche lacks the determination of Janet Leigh, and is more reminiscent of a kookie cutie. And Julianne Moore deserves better, she was wasted really as her Lila was too aggressive. Plus William H Macy in a ridiculously over-sized suit and hat looks uncomfortable as the private detective. In fact, the only redeeming quality was the modern reference about the dangling earphones, that was hilarious. But on the whole, it is badly acted and falls well short as a remake. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idea I'd like to see more of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many reviews of this film concentrate on its failure to "improve" the original, or remake, or somehow change it. Perhaps so many of these reviewers do not realize that a large percentage of today's moviegoers have never seen the original production in theaters, nor are they likely to. Which I think is enough reason to remake anything good like Psycho. Rather than adjust the content, even the angles, there is an almost perfect attention to details and dialog, with only a couple of small inserted elements that only clarify the original movie for people of today's era. The shower scene is no more graphic, but seems somehow more intense and vicious than the original, I think, because it's never something I've seen on a large screen. In fact the entire movie was highly intense and was terrific at introducing a pervasive sense of dread and the occasional shock that is completely absent from watching Psycho, the original, on video. Color does not matter to me - it makes it a little more accessible, I guess. And, surprisingly, the acting is, well, better than in the original. Vince Vaughn is a better actor in the role than Anthony Perkins was by far; Anne Heche performed well also. I've often wondered whether our old revered movies could be improved even better with better acting. Now, this would seem to indicate that this is something worth exploring. I'd like to see a remake of It's A Wonderful Life, faithfully, with, say, Harrison Ford acting in Jimmy Stewart's role. Movies like Psycho whose story as a minimum is superlative, and in this case, also its style, can successfully be remade with different and arguably better actors than the original to create a great movie experience that will extend the film's life another ten or twenty years as a film masterpiece. I think this film will do this for Psycho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mama's boy motel owner may be a killer. Jazzed-up remake of Alfred Hitchcock's signature thriller "Psycho" arrives with early strikes against it. Face it, the original "Psycho" was not the greatest movie ever made, it had a very thin plot and a tame final reel. This version (by Gus Van Sant?!) accentuates the original's weaknesses without adding anything positive. The performances are variable, ranging from excellent (Anne Heche) to uncomfortable (William H. Macy, in a hat!) to overwrought (Julianne Moore). The shocks aren't there, but I can't imagine the original would be too shocking for today's audiences either. On its own terms, a fairly decent film with some admirable qualities such as good cinematography and set-design. But if you're gonna go with this story, you can't pass up the original. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's shot-for-shot remake of "Psycho" most likely is the most hated movie ever. Fine, I can live with that statement. But simultaneously, it's frequently named as one of the worst movies ever made, and I don't really agree on that level. Seriously, how bad can a movie be when there are so many talent and experienced cast &amp; crew members involved? Because it's totally pointless and unnecessary, I hear you say? Sure thing, but about 85% off all movies are pointless, especially remakes of classic titles. "Psycho" indeed didn't require a modern update (heck, it still stands as the very first modern horror movie itself) but can you really blame Van Sant and his team that they saw a chance to make easy money? The new Psycho version is in color now, and the notorious shower-sequence is slightly more violent. These minor changes were enough to help younger audiences that, for whatever reasons never bothered to see the original, found their way to the theaters. You can debate endlessly whether Van Sant's style is blasphemy or not. Die-hard Hitchcock fans hate him because he so shamelessly copies every single aspect (the exact same music, cameos, facial expressions?) but I'm sure they'd hate him even more if he added some personal elements, because then he would have "violated" a genuine classic. Even if you swear by Hitchcock, you can still enjoy the terrific acting performances here. Although a sublime actor, Vince Vaughn had the impossible task to play Norman Bates. There's no way in hell anyone can outshine Anthony Perkins, but Vaughn's performance is praiseworthy nevertheless. Some of the supportive roles are ? do I dare say it ? an improvement over the original. Viggo Mortensen, Julianne Moore and especially William H. Macy are a joy to observe. In the end, it doesn't really matter how unnecessary this remake is, since it hasn't (and will never) affect the position of Alfred Hitchcock's groundbreaking film. "Psycho" is one of the greatest films ever realized and not a thousand remakes can ever change that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Idea and Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Psycho (1998)* (out of 4) I still remember walking into the theater to see this on opening weekend just wondering how on Earth they were going to try and top Hitchcock's original film or what they were going to change in order to throw viewers. Well, it turned out they didn't change a thing and instead just delivered a scene for scene remake with Vince Vaughn doing Norman Bates and Anne Heche playing the doomed Marion Crane. Everyone should know the story so there's no point going through that again. This was my first viewing of this film since 1998 and my main reason for going back was just to see if my eye rolling was the same today as it was back then. Turns out, the film comes off even worse on a second viewing because at least the first time you were curious as to what would be different but once you know that very little is, you can't help but see the film as pure camp with some downright horrendous performances. For the life of me I can't understand what Van Sant was thinking when he okay'd the cast to deliver some of the performances here. Vaughn is all over the place as Norman and at times he appears to be playing a SNL spoof. At times he plays it shy, at times going for a bad stereotype of a homosexual and at other times he just plays Norman as a downright loon. Heche doesn't come off any better and the scene with her and Norman eating is just a terrible sight to see considering how brilliant this sequence was in the original. Julianne Moore is bad as the sister, Viggo Mortensen's method acting blows up here and William H. Macy doesn't work as the Detective. The brief scene with Robert Forster is nice but no where near enough to save this film. As to why they tried to do a scene for scene remake is beyond me but of course they'd throw in a little nudity as well as a masturbating sequence, which is just another reason to role your eyes. Watching this train wreck does make you appreciate the original even more because you've got a very talented director here and a talented cast yet they create something this bad. It seems as if everyone involved just watched the original over and over again and then tried to mimic what they saw. The end results are incredibly bad and will look even worse on a repeat viewing. The badness is bad enough to the point that one day I'm sure people will watch this as a camp classic just like we watch so many bad movies from past decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier film . It`s not because this is a pointless re- film . That is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the " remake " of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago . The scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( But with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be thankful . He sure ain`t no Hitchcock ) in fact I might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat. Didn`t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s ? Bottom line:Avoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want an example of a reason remakes to classic films shouldn't always be made, then this is the perfect, almost comedic example. Razzie nominated director Gus Van Sant (To Die For, Good Will Hunting) hoped to create a more modern version of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's most celebrated film, and it just doesn't work. It is almost completely word-for-word and scene-for-scene, with the big differences being it is more modern, in colour and well known actors. You know the story, Marion Crane (Razzie nominated Anne Heche) steals cash, goes to the Bates Motel, meets and gets shaky with Norman Bates (Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn), he murders her in the shower, he dumps her, the car and the cash in the swamp, detective Milton Arbogast (William H. Macy) investigates and gets murdered, Marion's sister Lila (Julianne Moore) and lover Samuel 'Sam' Loomis (The Lord of the Rings' Viggo Mortensen) go to the motel, and you find out the mother is dead, and Bates is mother. Also starring Robert Forster as Dr. Fred Simon, Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Al Chambers, Liar Liar's Anne Haney as Mrs. Eliza Chambers, Roy Brocksmith as Man in Cowboy Hat outside Realty Office (who was Hitchcock) and Gus Van Sant as Man Talking to Man in Cowboy Hat. I can think of many reasons why this film is crap: crap acting, Norman Bates seems more kooky, almost camp, he even masturbates when looking through the peep hole (unlike Anthony Perkins), stupid flash-frames during the murders, the shower scene, meant to be the best moment of the film, is the worst (especially when instead of seeing the shower curtain torn off, you see Heche's ass), a less decomposed (looks like The Mummy or something) and just a weird remake. I can admit I liked how almost completely like the original it was in places, and it is quite good to see for a laugh, to see just how awful it is, but it is never going to be as good as Hitchcock's. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Poor!</fullReview>
