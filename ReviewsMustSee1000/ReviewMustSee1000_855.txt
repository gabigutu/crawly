		<shortDescription>Best Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many talks about G.O.R.A. as the funniest Turkish movie however, as plot vise, shootings and dialogs "pardon" beats all.First of all, the director is superb. He had put a lot in the movie, many so-called directors has a lot to learn from Mert Baykal. The script belongs the lead actor Ferhan Sensoy, who is one of the most intellectuals of Turkey. His plots and comedy is unmatched.I suggest this movie to anyone Turkish and non-Turkish people to see how a country's legal system can be corrupted. The story is one of the true stories of Turkey about its legal system faults. The acting and directing is superb. I have watched it three times in the same week and laughed each time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story explained in an amazingly funny way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ordinary man who did not have a very lucky life takes a vacation during his very late military duty. However he suddenly finds himself in the jail while he is trying to return home. This is how the story begins.Serious problems of Turkish current juridical and penal system could only be explained in such a funny and entertaining way. It has the potential to make you laugh no matter how many times you watch it.Very good soundtracks are also definitely worth mentioning.A Turkish comedy masterpiece from a theater master inspired by a real event. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classical political comedy that makes fun of the Turkish judicial system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical Ferhan Sensoy movie. Ferhan Sensoy is a popular writer, director and actor of Turkish theaters. He is well-known for his spontaneous acts which generally contains some political critics. He generally performs on stage in his own theater. Therefore, not many people get to see his acts most of the time. "Pardon", in that sense, is reaching out to people who can not come to watch his plays.Pardon is about three friends who were accidentally locked up in jail, although innocent, and who can not get out because of the mistakes of the court system in Turkey. Rasim Oztekin, credited as one of the best supporting comedians, acts remarkable. He adds to the storyline while playing Ferhan Sensoy's best friend. Ali Catalbas is another friend of Ferhan and Rasim, he plays an honest guy. Although he is not well-known yet, he is a very promising actor both as a comedian and drama actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, a Must see for Turkish viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the film has a excellent story line, it shows the Turkish penal system with all its truths and it shows how every penal system can fail, realism with comedy (and a bit of drama &amp; love) makes a great movie.The Movie is about one guys life,Ibrahim, and what he goes through in what you would call unfortunate events.His full with love for a girl in the neighbourhood but has a lot of hate for his brother in law.The film is mostly funny but has a touch of drama.It has a simple film to the film, the directing seems simple but it comes across as a great film,budget but great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! that really sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to see the movie last week, and what an unfortunate pick it was. I really appreciate the last movement in Turkish Cinema which has produced quite good films; but with this one, I can easily tell you that it is one of the worst I've ever watched coming from the last generation Turkish movies (as bad as "Dar Alanda Kisa Paslasmalar"). I waited, waited, waited....... with the hope that something was gonna happen and boom!!! the magical moment: turning all your perceptions of the movie upside down, making you get caught by the movie completely. Unfortunately, after waiting for this magical moment about 45 minutes, it was the time for me to realize that there wouldn't be anything interesting coming at all. Even though I consider myself pretty much patient person, I couldn't take it anymore -as most of you would have done the same thing- i had to ff to see what happened at the end. At that point, you might ask "How come there wasn't anything good in the whole movie which brings together some of the very well-known names from Turkish Cinema&amp;Theater scene?". Yes there was one thing good and it was Edip Akbayram's song; but even that couldn't help the movie not to suck</fullReview>
